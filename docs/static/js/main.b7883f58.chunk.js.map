Can I go?\r\nSandy: No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird.  Besides, there's not enough room for you.\r\nSpongeBob: But I don't take up that much space!  See?  I can fit in here.  Mmm, cozy.\r\nSandy: I need that drawer.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, how about...  This?  Or this?  Or this?\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, this isn't for fun.  See this? This is science.

This is for harvesting moon rocks.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.\r\nSandy: Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, hurry up!

Can't you see I'm sleeping here?\r\nPatrick: Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.\r\nSpongeBob: A present?\r\nPatrick: No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?\r\nSpongeBob: There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.\r\nPatrick: Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!\r\nSpongeBob: Alien repellent? Let me see that.  New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows!\r\nPatrick: Look how big it is, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: It's pretty impressive, all right.\r\nPatrick: Come on!\r\nSpongeBob: We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Wow.

This must be the control room.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, just don't touch anything.\r\nPatrick: Look, I'm winning!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here.

But let's see what this does!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think we should...\r\nPatrick: I like rockets.\r\nPatrick: More! More!\r\nSpongeBob: No more!  Okay, one more.  Okay, that's enough. Let's go.\r\nPatrick: Oh, wait, I think this one starts it.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?

Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!\r\nPatrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her.

Alien hunting!\r\nSpongeBob: Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too.

Whatever this is...  ...it's going on your permanent record!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.\r\nSpongeBob: There's no time for that! Just push harder.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble.

Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!\r\nPatrick: I think they make a cream for that now.\r\nSpongeBob: Here?\r\nSquidward: Too hot.\r\nSpongeBob: Here?\r\nSquidward: No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going.\r\nSpongeBob: Here?\r\nSquidward: Toulouse-Lautrec.\r\nSpongeBob: Too tired...\r\nSquidward: Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.\r\nSpongeBob: Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness.\r\nPatrick: One watermelon fresh from the manure fields, your spookiness.\r\nSpongeBob: Art thou not pleased?\r\nSquidward : Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.\r\nPatrick : What do you hunger for, master?\r\nSpongeBob: Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.\r\nSquidward: Cherry pie.  Where'd you get that?\r\nPatrick: I found it.\r\nSquidward: Well, go find it again!  SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around.  That's better. Now jog in place.  Say flank steak.\r\nSpongeBob: Flank steak.\r\nSquidward: I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop.  Now, play me an elaborate song with this!\r\nSpongeBob: But this is just a piece of tissue paper.\r\nSquidward: Oh, my.  Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't do it!\r\nSquidward: Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, because you're not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song.  What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.\r\nPatrick: I found it.\r\nSquidward: I'll take that!\r\nPatrick: Yes, your ghostliness!  This is fun.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you ready for this?\r\nPatrick: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming?\r\nPatrick: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, it's this way.\r\nPatrick: Where?\r\nSpongeBob: Here.\r\nPatrick: Oh, coming!  How are we going to clean up all this mess?\r\nSpongeBob: It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off!\r\nPatrick: Oh look, you missed some.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: We're going to go shopping?\r\nSpongeBob: No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest.\r\nSquidward: Ow, what the heck was that?\r\nSpongeBob: Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.\r\nSquidward: Ceremony for what?\r\nSpongeBob: We're going to put you to rest.\r\nSquidward: I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nSquidward: Well, I'm going to go check.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, get in.\r\nSquidward: Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing.\r\nSpongeBob: But you said we could put you to rest.\r\nSquidward: I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!\r\nSquidward: Now what?\r\nSpongeBob: I wrote “Here lies Squidward”. You may not remember him, but...  Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob!  Cut that out!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, look, the mourners have arrived.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?\r\nSpongeBob: No, just into this hole.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I have a confession to make.\r\nSpongeBob: You're bald?\r\nSquidward : No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!\r\nSpongeBob: But-\r\nSquidward: Do it!\r\nSpongeBob: Go home.  But, Master--\r\nSquidward: I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors.\r\nSpongeBob: As you wish, master.\r\nSquidward: D'oh!\r\nPatrick: Boy, he really had us fooled.\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.\r\nPatrick: You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, say that again.\r\nPatrick: That again?\r\nSpongeBob: No, the other thing.\r\nPatrick: No, the other thing.\r\nSpongeBob: No, what you said before when you...\r\nPatrick: No, what you said before when you..\r\nSpongeBob: Never mind. I've got an idea.\r\nPatrick: Never mind! I've got an idea.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't reach him!\r\nPatrick: Blow harder.  There he goes!\r\nSpongeBob: Isn't he beautiful?\r\nPatrick: How high's he going to go?\r\nSpongeBob: All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond.  Goodbye, friend.\r\nPatrick: Happy trails!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: You're welcome!\r\nSpongeBob: He's on the other side now.\r\nPatrick: Yeah.

You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.\r\nSquidward: As in, not here for three days?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.\r\nPatrick: Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!\r\nSquidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.\r\nSpongeBob: You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk...\r\nSquidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.\r\nSpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him.  The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.\r\nSquidward: Sure it's enough?\r\nGroup: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!\r\nPatrick: The bus is here! The bus is here!  C'mon, SpongeBob!\r\nGroup: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!\r\nSquidward: Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye-bye.\r\nSpongeBob: Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?\r\nSquidward: I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary.\r\nSquidward: Right, yeah, right.  Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers!  They're gone!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSquidward: This is going to be the best three days of my life.  I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob.  Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me.   The snail! I forgot the snail!  I've got to do something.  Okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here.  : Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!

What are you doing here?\r\nSquidward: Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.\r\nSpongeBob: What a great friend you are, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: So, uhh, well, see you. Goodbye.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward.  I can always count on you.  Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward!\r\nPurple Doctorfish: Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nPurple Doctorfish: This is definitely a snail.\r\nSpongeBob: I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?\r\nPurple Doctorfish: Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go.\r\nSpongeBob: Aren't you going to do it?\r\nPurple Doctorfish: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish.\r\nSquidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.\r\nSpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.\r\nSquidward: Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do...\r\nSpongeBob: Gary!\r\nSquidward: Okay, okay, I'll do it.\r\nSpongeBob: Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady.  Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again.\r\nSquidward: Will you hold him still?\r\nSpongeBob: Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.\r\nSquidward: Well, you made me do it.\r\nSpongeBob: What's going to happen to me?\r\nSquidward: Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know, I feel kind of funny!\r\nSquidward: I'm telling you, its all in your head.\r\nSquidward: He just needed water?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you're better!\r\nSquidward: Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!\r\nSquidward: Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?\r\nGary: Meow!\r\nSpongeBob: Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.\r\nGary: Meow?\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself.  Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top!\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, you're getting a  lot faster!\r\nSpongeBob: Look at me. Never better.  I'm okay!

I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee  ow!\r\nSquidward: I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary.  Who could that be? As if I didn't already know.  SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just fi-i-i...\r\nSpongeBob: Meow!\r\nSpongeBob: Meow! Meow.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done?  It's all your fault.

I wanna go to bed! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?\r\nMr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.\r\nSpongeBob: Pirates?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Treasure?  We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?\r\nSpongeBob: Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!\r\nPatrick: I'm Blind Beard the Pirate.\r\nSpongeBob: Ow.\r\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.\r\nSpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.\r\nSpongeBob: Okie dokie, then.\r\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, \"okie dokie, then.\" A pirate says, \"arrgh!\"\r\nSpongeBob: Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...\r\nMr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!\r\nPatrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land...\r\nMr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?\r\nSpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.\r\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, captain?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?\r\nPatrick: Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!\r\nMr. Krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the \"X\"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.\r\nPatrick: Ooh! East? I thought you said \"weast\"!\r\nMr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?\r\nPatrick: This one, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again.  9,551... 9,552...\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.\r\nPatrick: And hungry.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand!\r\nPatrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.\r\nMr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!\r\nMr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.\r\nPatrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.\r\nSpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.\r\nPatrick: I know.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?\r\nSpongeBob: He's not here.\r\nPatrick: Look! The treasure map.\r\nSpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Yeah...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\r\nPatrick: Nothing.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.\r\nPatrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?\r\nSpongeBob: No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\r\nPatrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?\r\nSpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?\r\nMr. Krabs: Do you think this is a problem?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?\r\nPatrick: We're sorry.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?\r\nSpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!\r\nPatrick: I think that.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!\r\nSpongeBob: Look! It's the \"X\".\r\nMr. Krabs: \"X\" marks the spot!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.\r\nSpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads. Heave!\r\nMr. Krabs: We finally found it.\r\nFemale Singers: The Dutchman's Treasure.\r\nAll: Wow!\r\nSpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?\r\nMr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!\r\nSpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!\r\nSpongeBob: What about loyalty?\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.  Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?\r\nMr. Krabs: They did!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow!\r\nFemale Singers: Two Gold Doubloons.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.\r\nMr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.\r\nFemale Singers: Plastic!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest.\r\nPatrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`17b\r\nRock Bottom\r\nSpongeBob: Another funtastic day at Glove World!\r\nBus Driver: Ahem.\r\nSpongeBob: Let me get my wallet.

Maybe we should wait for one more.\r\nPatrick: I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus.

You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.

You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!\r\nPatrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.\r\nKing Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever!

He's not disfigured. He's-he's just that sponge kid again.\r\nMermaid Man: Oh, yeah. Good to see you, lad. Say, Barnacle Boy, we gotta find out where that conch signal came from.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, that was me. I blew the conch signal, sir.\r\nMermaid Man: Alright. Where's the danger, son? Bring it on. Bring it on!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry. There's no danger.\r\nMermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: No danger?\r\nBarnacle Boy: Look, there has to be danger. You blew the conch signal. When you blow the... where'd you get that thing anyway?\r\nSpongeBob: I won it in a contest.\r\nMermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Contest?\r\nMermaid Man: They don't tell us anything anymore.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Look, Spongy, that ain't no toy.\r\nMermaid Man: That's right. The conch signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.\r\nBarnacle Boy: But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble. You got that?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sirs!\r\nMermaid Man: Good boy.\r\n{{L|Barnacle Boy|Come on, come on,  come on. They're serving meatloaf today. }}\r\nMermaid Man: Oh, goody.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Will you hurry up in there? And save me some hot wat...\r\nMermaid Man: The conch signal! Come, young ward!\r\nBarnacle Boy: Coming!\r\nMermaid Man: Oh... youth! Cut down in its prime!  Oh, speak to me, son.\r\nSpongeBob: Help... Can't...  open mayonnaise.\r\nBarnacle Boy: What?!   I come down in my underwear to open a jar of mayonnaise?!\r\nSpongeBob: But...\r\nBarnacle Boy: But nothing! We can't go around socializing. We have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies.\r\nMermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, think about it. Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Alright, okay. You can blow the conch every once in a while. Just give us  something to do when we  show up.\r\nSpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Yay!\r\nMermaid Man: Danger!\r\nBarnacle Boy: That's it! Gimme that! You're running us ragged.\r\nMermaid Man: Must... must answer clarion call!\r\nBarnacle Boy: We're exhausted!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it. I... just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes!\r\nBarnacle Boy: It's too late for that, Mr. Contest Winner. I'm gonna destroy this thing with my... sulfur vision!  I'll destroy it when I get back to the  , uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...\r\nMermaid Man: Barnacle Boy,  don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow. Or the villain. Besides, I remember another  young  whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.\r\nBarnacle Boy: You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot.\r\nMermaid Man: Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility.  But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?\r\nBarnacle Boy: What?\r\nMermaid Man: To the Invisible Boatmobile!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh...\r\nSpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells,  Barnacle Boy laid an egg, The Invisible Boatmobile,  lost a wheel and...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey,  can I drive?\r\nBarnacle Boy: Drive? What do you know about driving the Invisible Boatmobile?\r\nSpongeBob: Tons! Like the windshield wipers are right here.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Don't touch that button, that's the...!  ...Origami button.\r\nMermaid Man: When you patrol in the city, you'll always have to be vigilante. On your toes.  Constantly alert. Always expect the unexpected.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey!  I've got the doughnuts!\r\nSpongeBob & Mermaid Man: ...and Barnacle Boy laid an egg. Hey-hey!\r\nMermaid Man: Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime...  ...just like that.\r\nAtomic Flounder: Help! Help! Help somebody here.\r\nSpongeBob: You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder.\r\nMermaid Man: Stop, kid. Stop! Let him go.\r\nSpongeBob: But you said he could snap...  ...just like that.\r\nAtomic Flounder: What?! Get off of me!  If I weren't retired, I'd, I'd...  ...do that.  Out of my way, punk!\r\nSpongeBob: I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Uh, uh, say, kid, why don't you take this nickel and go up there and see if our theme song in on the jukebox?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nMermaid Man: You know, for a pain in the neck, he's a pretty nice kid.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Let's ditch him.\r\nMermaid Man: I'm right behind you.\r\nSpongeBob: It doesn't seem to be here.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Oh, it's there, all right.\r\nMermaid Man: Keep looking. Diligence. Diligence.\r\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Dagnabbit.\r\nMermaid Man: What's the matter?\r\nBarnacle Boy: Where did we park the Invisible Boatmobile?\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked.  But I can't let my heroes down.\r\nMermaid Man: Boatmobile, where are you?  Barnacle Boy, I found it.\r\nDirty Bubble: Still getting burned on that tail pipe, huh, Barnacle Boy?\r\nBarnacle Boy: It's the Dirty Bubble!\r\nMermaid Man: In all his dirty roundness!\r\nMermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: Oh, no!\r\nSpongeBob: I found it and it's the special dance mix!\r\nMermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: Help! Help! Help!\r\nSpongeBob: Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it!\r\nDirty Bubble: You cannot save them, Sponge of Mystery! They are trapped by my awesome surface tension!\r\nSpongeBob: You don't understand! You're my most favorite super villain. Can I get your autograph?\r\nDirty Bubble: Oh, no!  Oh, no, you fool, stay back! The point. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Watch the point now!\r\nMermaid Man: Aha! You saved us, son.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Yeah, you're a hero.\r\nSpongeBob: I am?\r\nMermaid Man: Are you up for another ride in the Invisible Boatmobile?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh...\r\nSpongeBob & Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells, Barnacle Boy laid an egg...\r\nAll 3: The Dirty Bubble popped And Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and SpongeBob got away!
