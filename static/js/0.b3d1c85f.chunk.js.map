I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up!

SpongeBob, are you mad?\r\nPlankton: Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.\r\nSquidward: Mediocre?\r\nPlankton: You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste!\r\nSpongeBob: Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?\r\nPlankton: Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party!\r\nSpongeBob: Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!  Never! Never!\r\nPlankton: Toot toot! How about a little take-out?\r\nSpongeBob: No, never!  You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula!\r\nPlankton: You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, no!  There's no one here.\r\nPlankton: Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player?\r\nSpongeBob: I must fight!\r\nPlankton: No, no, no, no.  There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it.\r\nKaren Plankton: Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed.\r\nPlankton: Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula.  And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty.  This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants?\r\nSpongeBob: I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, you delicate little Krabby Patty.\r\nPlankton: Mmm...\r\nSpongeBob: With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness.\r\nPlankton: Steamy...\r\nSpongeBob: I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns.\r\nPlankton: Yes... yes... yes!  Come to papa!  Oh, boy...\r\nKaren: Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas.\r\nPlankton: Well, this stinks.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, patty, I guess we can go home now.\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!

You don't know what day it is, do you?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Wednesday?\r\nSquidward: Why, it's Opposite Day!  You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!\r\nSpongeBob: Does everybody know about Opposite Day?\r\nSquidward: Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, a game.\r\nSquidward: Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?\r\nSpongeBob: Quiet and out of the way! Yay!\r\nSquidward: Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.\r\nSpongeBob: I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day.  I'm not ready!\r\nSquidward: So long, chum.  And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary! It's Opposite Day and I...  ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day.  Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?\r\nGary: Meow!\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, where’s your holiday spirit?\r\nSpongeBob: Company! I hate company. Who's there?\r\nPatrick: It's Patrick!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!\r\nSpongeBob: That's right! You're my worst enemy!  Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!\r\nPatrick: Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!\r\nSpongeBob: You have?\r\nPatrick: No! What is it?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.\r\nPatrick: Oh! Let me try! Let me try!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick, breathe!  Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way!\r\nSpongeBob: Meow.\r\nPatrick: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Kcirtap yeh.\r\nPatrick: Pu evig i.\r\nSpongeBob: Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot!\r\nSpongeBob: Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?\r\nPatrick: Nope.\r\nSquidward: Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob!  I'm almost sorry I'm leaving!  Opposite Day.  SpongeBob, what are you...\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day...  ...terrible?\r\nSquidward: I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me!\r\nSquidward: If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house!\r\nPatrick: Isn't it beautiful?\r\nSpongeBob: On Opposite Day it is.\r\nSquidward: Out of the way, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!\r\nPatrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite, too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!  I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite...  ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better.  Now you try.\r\nPatrick: Okay.  I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: After you, Mr. Squidward.\r\nPatrick: Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be \"Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!\"\r\nPatty: Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person!  Hello, Mr...  Uh... Mr. Tentacles?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, please come in.\r\nPatty: It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, everyone says that.\r\nPatty: Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.\r\nSpongeBob: Positive things! Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.\r\nPatty: Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.\r\nSpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?\r\nPatty: Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...\r\nSpongeBob: Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.\r\nPatty: Oh my, this painting is very nice.\r\nPatrick: Thank you!\r\nPatty: Who's that?!\r\nSpongeBob: I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.\r\nPatty: You're both Squidward?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're both Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet.  NO!\r\nPatty: Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nPatty: I really don't want to hear more, thank you.\r\nSpongeBob: I hear you loud and clear.\r\nSquidward: Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two  barnacle heads  haven't harmed you in any way.\r\nPatty: Who are you?\r\nSquidward: Why, I'm Squidward!\r\nPatty: What kind of fool do you take me for?! He's Squidward, he's Squidward, you're Squidward?! I'm Squidward! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nPatty: I'm outta here.\r\nSquidward: Ma'am, please! What about my house?!\r\nPatty: I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on earth!\r\nSquidward: Wait!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't...\r\nPatrick: ...Go!\r\nSquidward: No, no, no, no, no!\r\nPatty: Stop!

Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?\r\nSpongeBob: No, stay back!\r\nSquidward: What is the matter with you two?\r\nPatrick: Don't, don't hurt us!\r\nSpongeBob: It was an accident!\r\nSquidward: What are you two talking about?  Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...\r\nSpongeBob: Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost!  Spare us your ghostly anger!\r\nPatrick: Oh, yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!\r\nSpongeBob: We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us!\r\nSquidward: Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.\r\nSpongeBob: Does that include...\r\nSquidward: Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!\r\nPatrick: I think they make a cream for that now.\r\nSpongeBob: Here?\r\nSquidward: Too hot.\r\nSpongeBob: Here?\r\nSquidward: No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going.\r\nSpongeBob: Here?\r\nSquidward: Toulouse-Lautrec.\r\nSpongeBob: Too tired...\r\nSquidward: Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy.  Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.\r\nSpongeBob: Only the freshest, o spooky one.  A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness.  A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness.\r\nPatrick: One watermelon fresh from the manure fields, your spookiness.\r\nSpongeBob: Art thou not pleased?\r\nSquidward : Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.\r\nPatrick : What do you hunger for, master?\r\nSpongeBob: Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.\r\nSquidward: Cherry pie.  Where'd you get that?\r\nPatrick: I found it.\r\nSquidward: Well, go find it again!  SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around.  That's better. Now jog in place.  Say flank steak.\r\nSpongeBob: Flank steak.\r\nSquidward: I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop.  Now, play me an elaborate song with this!\r\nSpongeBob: But this is just a piece of tissue paper.\r\nSquidward: Oh, my.  Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't do it!\r\nSquidward: Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, because you're not allowed to leave that spot until I hear a song.  What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.\r\nPatrick: I found it.\r\nSquidward: I'll take that!\r\nPatrick: Yes, your ghostliness!  This is fun.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you ready for this?\r\nPatrick: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, let's go.

How are we going to clean up all this mess?\r\nSpongeBob: It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off!\r\nPatrick: Oh look, you missed some.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman.  It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: We're going to go shopping?\r\nSpongeBob: No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest.\r\nSquidward: Ow, what the heck was that?\r\nSpongeBob: Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.\r\nSquidward: Ceremony for what?\r\nSpongeBob: We're going to put you to rest.\r\nSquidward: I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nSquidward: Well, I'm going to go check.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, get in.\r\nSquidward: Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing.\r\nSpongeBob: But you said we could put you to rest.\r\nSquidward: I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!\r\nSquidward: Now what?\r\nSpongeBob: I wrote “Here lies Squidward”. You may not remember him, but...  Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob!  Cut that out!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, look, the mourners have arrived.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?\r\nSpongeBob: No, just into this hole.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I have a confession to make.\r\nSpongeBob: You're bald?\r\nSquidward : No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!\r\nSpongeBob: But-\r\nSquidward: Do it!\r\nSpongeBob: Go home.  But, Master--\r\nSquidward: I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and please stop doing me favors.\r\nSpongeBob: As you wish, master.\r\nSquidward: D'oh!\r\nPatrick: Boy, he really had us fooled.\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.\r\nPatrick: You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, say that again.\r\nPatrick: That again?\r\nSpongeBob: No, the other thing.\r\nPatrick: No, the other thing.\r\nSpongeBob: No, what you said before when you...\r\nPatrick: No, what you said before when you..\r\nSpongeBob: Never mind. I've got an idea.\r\nPatrick: Never mind! I've got an idea.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't reach him!\r\nPatrick: Blow harder.  There he goes!\r\nSpongeBob: Isn't he beautiful?\r\nPatrick: How high's he going to go?\r\nSpongeBob: All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond.

Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls.  No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.\r\nSpongeBob: Do you mean I'm not scary?\r\nFlying Dutchman: You? Scary?!  Let me tell you about scary, kid.

On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, go home already.

I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...\r\nMr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!\r\nPatrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land...\r\nMr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?\r\nSpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.\r\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, captain?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?\r\nPatrick: Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!\r\nMr. Krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the \"X\"?

You're fired again.  9,551... 9,552...\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.\r\nPatrick: And hungry.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand!\r\nPatrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.\r\nMr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!\r\nMr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.\r\nPatrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.\r\nSpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.\r\nPatrick: I know.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?\r\nSpongeBob: He's not here.\r\nPatrick: Look! The treasure map.\r\nSpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Yeah...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\r\nPatrick: Nothing.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.\r\nPatrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?\r\nSpongeBob: No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\r\nPatrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?\r\nSpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?\r\nMr. Krabs: Do you think this is a problem?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?\r\nPatrick: We're sorry.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?\r\nSpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!\r\nPatrick: I think that.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!\r\nSpongeBob: Look! It's the \"X\".\r\nMr. Krabs: \"X\" marks the spot!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.\r\nSpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads.

How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?\r\nMr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!\r\nSpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!\r\nSpongeBob: What about loyalty?\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.

So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow!\r\nFemale Singers: Two Gold Doubloons.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.\r\nMr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.\r\nFemale Singers: Plastic!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest.\r\nPatrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`17b\r\nRock Bottom\r\nSpongeBob: Another funtastic day at Glove World!\r\nBus Driver: Ahem.\r\nSpongeBob: Let me get my wallet.

I don't know what to do with the other one!\r\nSpongeBob: I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?\r\nSpongeBob: Sure!\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SPONGEBOB!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\r\nPlankton: Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance.  You can have anything you want with a little training.\r\nSpongeBob: Training?\r\nPlankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.\r\nSpongeBob: Assertive, huh?\r\nPlankton: That's right.\r\nSpongeBob: Anything I want.  Sounds great!\r\nPlankton: Wonderful.  SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!\r\nSpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.\r\nPlankton: No, no, be assertive!\r\nSpongeBob: Beep Beep!\r\nPlankton: Not in-sertive!  SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!\r\nSpongeBob: But I'm a spo...\r\nPlankton: Don't say it!  There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?\r\nSpongeBob: Ice cream!\r\nPlankton: Listen, you! My friend's got something to say!\r\nEel: What, who said that?  Was it you?\r\nPlankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!\r\nSpongeBob: That's my ice cream cone!\r\nPlankton: Great! Now let him have it!\r\nSpongeBob: You can have it.\r\nEel: Say, thanks!\r\nPlankton: No!  I'll show ya how!  Hey, pencil neck!  Yeah, you. Slither over here!  Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!\r\nPlankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah!\r\nPlankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.\r\nPlankton: Whatever.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it!  I found something!\r\nScooter Like Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours?\r\nSpongeBob: Sure!\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!\r\nSpongeBob: Do you want to take a hike with me?\r\nScooter Like Fish: Yeah.\r\nPlankton: Now, look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, go check in that ditch!\r\nScooter Like Fish: Wow, buried treasure! Thanks!\r\nSpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!\r\nFish: But I'm wearing sandals!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, never mind!  It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?\r\nPlankton: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.  I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.\r\nSpongeBob: No it's not!\r\nPlankton: Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.\r\nSpongeBob: But what about airline food?\r\nPlankton: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night!  See, I can be a stand-up guy. See?\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!\r\nPlankton: Okay, but this is your last chance!  Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?\r\nSpongeBob: Just watch me!  Man, this thing is sandy!\r\nFred: My leg!\r\nPlankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach!  SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, not all of me.\r\nHot Dog Man: Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\r\nPlankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!\r\nSpongeBob: I'll do better than that!\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nPlankton: Breaking your wind!\r\nLarry: Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball.\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male!  Plankton?  Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!\r\nPlankton: Exactly.\r\nSpongeBob: You didn't tell me everyone would leave.\r\nPlankton: Oops.\r\nSpongeBob: Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development!  That wasn't nice!\r\nPlankton: Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?\r\nPlankton: Huh? What are you doing?  Wait, SpongeBob! Stop!  Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting!\r\nSpongeBob: What happened?\r\nScooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!\r\nSpongeBob: No problem!\r\nScooter: Whoa!  Killer!\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back!  Wait!\r\nScooter: Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.\r\nPlankton: Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting!

He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.\r\nSquidward: I have arrived.  What's so funny?

Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.\r\nKing Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.  No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no...  Ah!\r\nSpongeBob: But, but...\r\nKing Neptune: A purveyor of foods.  Yes, you must be my new fry cook.\r\nHot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune.

You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!\r\nPatrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.\r\nKing Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever!

Yes I did it! I admit it!  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked!\r\nMr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.\r\nSpongeBob: What am I gonna do?\r\nMr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs.

SpongeBob SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: Whahoo!  Oh, I wonder when my  prize will...  get here...  My prize!  Can it be? It is.  The conch signal.  From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

Say, Barnacle Boy, we gotta find out where that conch signal came from.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, that was me. I blew the conch signal, sir.\r\nMermaid Man: Alright. Where's the danger, son? Bring it on. Bring it on!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry. There's no danger.\r\nMermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: No danger?\r\nBarnacle Boy: Look, there has to be danger. You blew the conch signal. When you blow the... where'd you get that thing anyway?\r\nSpongeBob: I won it in a contest.\r\nMermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Contest?\r\nMermaid Man: They don't tell us anything anymore.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Look, Spongy, that ain't no toy.\r\nMermaid Man: That's right. The conch signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.\r\nBarnacle Boy: But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble. You got that?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sirs!\r\nMermaid Man: Good boy.\r\n{{L|Barnacle Boy|Come on, come on,  come on.

We have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies.\r\nMermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, think about it. Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Alright, okay. You can blow the conch every once in a while. Just give us  something to do when we  show up.\r\nSpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Yay!\r\nMermaid Man: Danger!\r\nBarnacle Boy: That's it! Gimme that! You're running us ragged.\r\nMermaid Man: Must... must answer clarion call!\r\nBarnacle Boy: We're exhausted!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it.

I'll destroy it when I get back to the  , uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...\r\nMermaid Man: Barnacle Boy,  don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow. Or the villain. Besides, I remember another  young  whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.\r\nBarnacle Boy: You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot.\r\nMermaid Man: Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility.  But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?\r\nBarnacle Boy: What?\r\nMermaid Man: To the Invisible Boatmobile!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh...\r\nSpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells,  Barnacle Boy laid an egg, The Invisible Boatmobile,  lost a wheel and...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey,  can I drive?\r\nBarnacle Boy: Drive?

On your toes.  Constantly alert. Always expect the unexpected.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey!  I've got the doughnuts!\r\nSpongeBob & Mermaid Man: ...and Barnacle Boy laid an egg. Hey-hey!\r\nMermaid Man: Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime...  ...just like that.\r\nAtomic Flounder: Help! Help! Help somebody here.\r\nSpongeBob: You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder.\r\nMermaid Man: Stop, kid. Stop! Let him go.\r\nSpongeBob: But you said he could snap...  ...just like that.\r\nAtomic Flounder: What?! Get off of me!  If I weren't retired, I'd, I'd...  ...do that.

So, what are we going to do tomorrow.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Uh, uh, say, kid, why don't you take this nickel and go up there and see if our theme song in on the jukebox?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nMermaid Man: You know, for a pain in the neck, he's a pretty nice kid.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Let's ditch him.\r\nMermaid Man: I'm right behind you.\r\nSpongeBob: It doesn't seem to be here.\r\nBarnacle Boy: Oh, it's there, all right.\r\nMermaid Man: Keep looking.

If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.  Are you finished with those errands yet?\r\nSquidward: Aha!  I know you're in here.  What?  He's heading back to the Krusty Krab!  I'll beat him there!  I've got you now, SpongeBob!\r\nSadie: Hey, put some clothes on!\r\nSquidward: The truth will be revealed!\r\nPatrick: Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward!\r\nPurple Doctorfish: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thanks, Doc.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you can't beat me!  AHA! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! Or the toilet in my bathroom!  And then you were in my bathtub, and  I... and-and you... and I... and then you... swam... down the drain... and... beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, does that mean you're...?\r\nSquidward: Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do.\r\nSpongeBob: Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open\". .

Cherries... Boring.  Ah, here we go! Onions!  Ready, Gary?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Just one more thing! Pea...  ...nuts. Gary!  Our peanuts jar is totally empty!  Hmmm...  Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts.  Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill.  A little texture never hurt. There we go.  This sundae's gonna taste great!  Aren't you going to help me, Gary? Gary? Oh, well. More for me!  You know what they say, Gary. I'm easy like Sunday morning.  Okay, let's see my to-do list.

I'm confused.\r\nPatrick: Yes, I am.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch.  Hi, building!  I just don't get it.\r\nPatrick: I don't either. Maybe it's the way you're dressed.\r\nBoth: Nah.\r\nPatrick: Maybe it's your voice.\r\nSpongeBob: Good one, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Well, maybe it's just because you're ugly.\r\nSpongeBob: Ugly?  You gotta be kiddin' me..\r\nPatrick: Better try the reflection test.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi.\r\nPatrick: Ugly.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly!  Am I ugly?  Am I ugly?\r\nDriver: My eyes! My eyes!\r\nSpongeBob: Oof I'm ugly...\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads?  SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am.\r\nPatrick: Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up.  It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.'  Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end.\r\nSpongeBob: That didn't help at all.  How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you.\r\nSpongeBob: Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling!  Thanks, Patrick.  It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over.\r\nPatrick: Just do what I do when I have problems.  Scream!  Come on, buddy. I'll help you.  Okay, now, say it.  Say it.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest.\r\nSpongeBob: I know, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Say it. Say it.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly.\r\nPatrick: You're ugly and what...?\r\nSpongeBob: Square?\r\nPatrick: No. Proud.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.\r\nPatrick: Good!

I'm ugly and I'm proud!\r\nSquidward: Is that what he calls it?\r\nSpongeBob: That felt great! I feel empowered.\r\nPatrick: So whaddya wanna do now?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know. How about a movie?  Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through.\r\nPatrick: People respect self esteem.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway.  Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.\r\nFred: Not at all, boy.  Deuueaugh!\r\nPatrick: Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a-  SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?\r\nSpongeBob: I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried,  but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide.\r\nPatrick: What is wrong with you people?!  Afraid to look ugliness in the face?  Well, here! Look at it!  It's ugly, isn't it?!  You look at it!\r\nSpongeBob: Hello.\r\nPatrick: You look at it!\r\nSpongeBob: Hi.\r\nPatrick: Look at it!  Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!\r\nSpongeBob: They all ran away, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: I bet there's no line at the snack bar.  Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered.  I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!\r\nPatrick: That looks great!  Oh, I gotta go to the restroom!  I'm out of soap, can I borrow-\r\nMartin: Stay back!\r\nPatrick: I just want some-\r\nMartin: Here! Here's my money!  Take it! Take it and go away!\r\nPatrick: My hands aren't that dirty...  Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?\r\nClay: You tryin' to kill us?!\r\nPatrick: Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, is everything okay in here?  What are you doing in there, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Wouldn't you like to know?\r\nSpongeBob: And why is that bag on your head?\r\nPatrick: Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly!  What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!\r\nSpongeBob: Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.\r\nPatrick: That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick...?\r\nPatrick: What's my mom gonna say?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick!  You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad.\r\nPatrick: Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...\r\nSpongeBob: Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick!

Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh!\r\nSquidward: Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?\r\nPearl: Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab?\r\nSpongeBob: The King Krab?\r\nPearl: The Kandy Krab!\r\nSpongeBob: The Kool Krab.

You're a true visionary, Pearl.\r\nPearl: Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter.\r\nPearl: SpongeBob, order up!\r\nSpongeBob: Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-lad?  Here you go. Two sa-lads.\r\nPearl: Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.\r\nSpongeBob: But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.\r\nPearl: Exactly.\r\nSpongeBob: All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties,  happenin.'  Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.\r\nNazz: This is so cool!\r\nSpongeBob: Two salads.  That was awful.

You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh... right on.\r\nPearl: Check out this new menu I came up with.\r\nSpongeBob: Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?\r\nPearl: Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore.

What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!

Nothing I do is working!\r\nSpongeBob: Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!\r\nPearl: No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?\r\nSpongeBob: I got it! I can pretend to  \"fire you.\" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.\r\nPearl: Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!\r\nSpongeBob: Stop trying to break me in half?\r\nPearl: Deal.  Oh, boy!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.

Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.\r\nSquidward: I'm not taking an order for a bubble.\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.

Squidward will make a fresh batch.\r\nSquidward: What, is he allergic to bread, too?\r\nSpongeBob: Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...\r\nSquidward: Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!

You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.\r\nSquidward: Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs. I learned my lesson. And by the way, Bubble Buddy picked up the tab.\r\nMr. Krabs: What's this?\r\nSquidward: Bubble money.

So, are you ready?\r\nSquidward: To go home?\r\nMr. Krabs: No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards...  ...that guy!\r\nMr. Krabs: That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift.  Ta-dah.\r\nSquidward: \"I Heart you...\"\r\nMr. Krabs: Try it on, Mr. Squidward!

If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!\r\nSquidward: Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.\r\nPirate: Oh, these aren't homemade.

We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.\r\nSquidward: So, what flavor is it?\r\nPirates: Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.\r\nSquidward: Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back.  Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.\r\nMr. Krabs: Not yet.

Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours.\r\nSquidward: You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had.

Uh, let me see it.\r\nSpongeBob: The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.\r\nSquidward: Everything's in red.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I know.\r\nSquidward: We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.\r\nSpongeBob: Then let's roll!  Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.\r\nSquidward: Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.  Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward.  Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Hey, Frank.

The last thing on the list is...\r\nSquidward: Does it involve more dismemberment?\r\nSpongeBob: Watch the sunset with Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Sunset?\r\nMr. Krabs: The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs.  Okay, see you later.\r\nSquidward: C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful.

You, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us.\r\nSquidward: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Explosions... I mean, erosion.\r\nSpongeBob: You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.\r\nSquidward: Four... three... two... one...\r\nSpongeBob: I guess we started too early. Let's start again.\r\nSquidward: Five... four... three...  two...  o-o-o-one...

Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.\r\nSquidward: Why are you still here?!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.\r\nSquidward: Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!\r\nSpongeBob: You want me to explode?\r\nSquidward: Yes!

Now it's your turn!\r\nSquidward: That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, good one.\r\nSquidward: No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!\r\nSpongeBob: Why would I do that?\r\nSquidward: Because the pie you ate was a bomb!\r\nSpongeBob: What pie?\r\nSquidward: The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!\r\nSpongeBob: Pie...pie...

Just a regular, normal, peace-loving-  Heaven at last.\r\nOther Octopus: I've seen more alert people in a retirement home!\r\nSquidward: Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar? Don't be late!\r\nOther Octopus: I've heard better comebacks from a turkey sandwich! Get a life!\r\nSquidward: This place is even better than I expected!  302, 303, and 304. Beautiful.  And not a pineapple in sight.\r\nSquidward: Good night, Clary. Tomorrow, we begin life anew.\r\nSquidward: 304 New Life street, Squidward speaking.  There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob! I am finally among my own kind.  Now, goodbye.\r\nSquidward: Ahh. I think I'll take my bike today.  I'm my own man.  Now these neighbors know how to live.  Intensive.

It's even better in a group!  This town is perfect.  A clarinet trio?!  Aah, another great day.  Oh look! Everybody's on their bike today.  It just gets better and better!  All together!  I sorta... don't feel like playing my clarinet today.  Yep, this is great. They might as well rename this town \"Squidward's Paradise.\" Or perhaps \"too much paradise.\"  SpongeBob?  Oops.  Leaves. Just getting the leaves.\r\nSquidette: Would you pipe down over there, iron lung?\r\nSquidward: Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a \"leg\" to stand on!\r\nSquidette: Hey! That's not funny!\r\nOctopus #1: Yeah!\r\nOctopus #2: What's going on over here?\r\nSquidette: It's that guy! He's playing with a reef blower!\r\nOctopus #2: Playing? With a reef blower? That's the most childish thing I've ever heard of!\r\nSquidward: But it's fun!\r\nOctopus #2: How could you possibly have fun with one of those oversized hair dryers?\r\nSquidward: Like this!\r\nOctopus #2: Give it back! Please!\r\nSquidward: Tag! You're it!\r\nOctopus on bike: Wah!  Le Café\r\nSquidette: What can I get you boys?\r\nOctopus: What are you looking at?\r\nOctopus #2: Those.\r\nSpongeBob: Here it is, Patrick. Now we've just got to convince Squidward to come back home. You got our apology cake?  We're ready!\r\nPatrick: Ying!\r\nGuard: Hello, can I help you?\r\nPatrick: Can I get a large #1, extra size?\r\nSpongeBob: But you just ate three orders of fried oyster skins!\r\nPatrick: I love... fried oyster skins.\r\nGuard: We're sorry, but your kind isn't allowed here.  He's not leaving, Orville.  You got your night stick ready?  Fried oyster skins?!\r\nPatrick: I guess we've got to order inside.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey! That looked like Squidward!  That looked like Squidward also, in angry mob form!\r\nPoliceman: Hold it right there, Mr. Tentacles!\r\nSquidward: Stand back! I've got gardening tools!\r\nPoliceman: Here! Just read this!\r\nSquidward: What is it?\r\nPoliceman: A well thought out and organized list of complaints!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, look! It's Squidward!  Squidward! We finally found you!\r\nOctopus: Get off me! I'm not Squidward!\r\nPatrick: Are you Squidward now?\r\nSquidward: Grievances! This town is a grievance! There should be a law against so many stuck-up tightwads living in one place! This city needs to be destroyed!… or at least painted a different color.\r\nPoliceman: FYI, you don't have to live here, you know!\r\nSquidward: Hey, you're right!  And I'm leaving ASAP!\r\nSpongeBob: Are you Squidward?\r\nMale Octopus: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Are you Squidward?\r\nSquidette: No.\r\nPatrick: Are you Squidward?  That's okay, take your time.\r\nSpongeBob: Any one of these Squidward's can be the real Squidward, Patrick!\r\nSquidward: Freedom!

What's that?\r\nSandy: It's when I go to sleep for the whole winter.\r\nSpongeBob: Can I do that?\r\nSandy: No, silly. It's a mammalian thing.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, you may not have noticed, but I is 100% ma-male.\r\nSandy: Enough chitter-chatter, SpongeBob. We don't have much time left!\r\nSpongeBob: Why, Sandy?

You're making this the best pre-hibernation week ever.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I'd better get home before Gary chews up the sofa again.  Good night, Gary.\r\nSandy: Nothing like a refreshing morning dip, huh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: W-what h-happened to s-sleeping?\r\nSandy: I'll be asleep all winter! We only got three days for fun.

Now for the speed course. Hold on!  I hope we make it!  I'm havin' fun, too!  Wake up, slowpoke.  We're going fly-fishing.\r\nSpongeBob: This squirrel's trying to kill me!

Santa came! \"\"\r\nSquidward: Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...\r\nSpongeBob: You're welcome.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob? He made me a present?

And it's even got my name on it.  What's this?  Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a...  big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I guess I won't be needing this.  That's better.\r\nSquidward: Poor little guy.

Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly?\r\nSquidward: Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.\r\nSpongeBob: Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?\r\nSquidward: Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.\r\nSpongeBob: And what about that nose?  I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that thing's gigantic.\r\nSquidward: Alright! I'm Santa.\r\nSpongeBob: Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.\r\nSquidward: I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.\r\nSpongeBob: I did?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSquidward: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.\r\nShelly: Do you have a present for me, Santa?\r\nSquidward: Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...\r\nSpongeBob: Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.\r\nSquidward: Uhh, right, just a second.  C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect!  There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!\r\nShelly: Thanks, Santa.\r\nSquidward: That almost felt good.  I didn't... who?\r\nFred: Hey, Santa, where's my present?\r\nOld Man Jenkins: And mine!\r\nAbigail-Marge: And what about me?\r\nSquidward: Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people.  Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.\r\nJennifer-Millie: Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted.  A new hairstyle.\r\nSquidward: Here you go, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Wow.  A wrist watch.\r\nSquidward: What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane?  You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind.  And Santa is... oh, his belly was small but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...\r\nSquidward: Well, at least it's over.  Huh? What's this?\r\nSanta: Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus.  Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

And how many do I need to pass?\r\nMrs. Puff: Six.\r\nSpongeBob: Whoo.\r\nMrs. Puff: Hundred.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nMrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got six.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry. I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year!  Well, see you next Tuesday!  Yeah!  I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year.  One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year!\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole!  Extra crediiiiit!\r\nSpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit!  I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.\r\nSpongeBob: What's extra credit?\r\nMrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh…..\r\nMrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit?\r\nSpongeBob: Extra credit!\r\nMrs. Puff: That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class, and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a ten-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.\r\nSpongeBob: But I've learned so many things.\r\nMrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started.  \"What I learned in boating school is…\" There! That's already seven words! Only three more!\r\nSpongeBob: L… e… a… r…  Oh, barnacles.\r\nMrs. Puff: What's wrong?\r\nSpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil.  N… e…\r\nMrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen.\r\nSpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils.  Gonna write an essay, that's what I say.  There.\r\nMrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it.\r\nSpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind!\r\nMrs. Puff: I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't look! It's not ready.\r\nMrs. Puff: It's so simple, only ten words! \"What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity,  Blank!\"\r\nSpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!\r\nMrs. Puff: \"What I learned in boating school is…!\" \"What I learned in boating school is…!\"\r\nSpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!  Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here?  My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop!\r\nMrs. Puff: You only need three… more… words!  Okay, let me see what you've written.\r\nSpongeBob: It's not ready yet.\r\nMrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nMrs. Puff: Give it to me!\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nMrs. Puff: Let me see it!  \"What I learned in boating school is…\" Uh…  Well, the rest doesn't matter!  You pass!  You pass!\r\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.\r\nMrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?\r\nMrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license.\r\nSpongeBob: My license!  It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-\r\nMrs. Puff: Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!\r\nSpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom!

Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!\r\nMrs. Puff: Well, I... Okay.\r\nMrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...\r\nMrs. Puff: See what?\r\nMr. SquarePants: Ta-da.  \"IM-RDY\".\r\nMrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?!\r\nSpongeBob: For me...?\r\nMrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff...

I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins.\r\nMr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, Son.\r\nSpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is!\r\nMr. SquarePants: We're gonna have to hold off on the driving there for a while, son.\r\nMrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Boaty.  Boaty, you're cold!  Take my socks.  Oh, Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea!\r\nMrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this.  Oh yeah…\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving!  Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing!  Oh my gosh, I know who you are!\r\nMrs. Puff: No, you don't! You don't know who I am!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, I do! I know that you're... a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray!  Somebody help me! Somebody help me!\r\nMrs. Puff: Sorry, SpongeBob, but it was for your own good.\r\nSpongeBob: Give me back my boat!  You'd better stop this boat!  I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even…  Giant clams?!  I'm… not… letting… go… not even for…  Cheese graters?!  If you think I'll let go just for a little…  educational television?! Oh, no!\r\nMrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes!\r\nSpongeBob as Radio: And now back to KRUD, with all of your personal \"you won't get away with stealing my car!\" hits.\r\nCop 1: Hey, look.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were…  … Mrs. Puff?  So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.\r\nSpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?\r\nMrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.\r\nSpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student . And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?\r\nMrs. Puff: What's that?\r\nSpongeBob: Free driving lessons!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`30b\r\nI'm Your Biggest Fanatic\r\nSpongeBob: Wow!

Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?\r\nHarold: Why?\r\nSpongeBob: Because, they're so darn stupid!\r\nPatrick: That's a good one, huh, Sandy?\r\nSandy: Uhh, y-yeah...\r\nMr. Krabs: That was fantastic, boy. You really knocked them out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!\r\nSpongeBob: I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.\r\nMr. Krabs: The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show.\r\nSpongeBob: At least I don't have to clean up my act!\r\nMr. Krabs: Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy.\r\nSpongeBob: Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really.  Oh, hey, Sandy!\r\nSandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Did you enjoy the show?\r\nSandy: Well, ac-actually, SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom.\r\nSandy: Well, I can't argue with that.\r\nSpongeBob: We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time!\r\nSandy: You're right, SpongeBob. I was being a little too sensitive.  No hard feelings.  Okay, deodorant. Huh, let's see. Roll-on or stick?\r\nFred: I think she should buy both.\r\nSandy: Huh?\r\nScooter: Hey, look, guys!  It's the stupid squirrel!\r\nLloyd: I know, let's try to communicate with it.\r\nAll: Duh...\r\nSandy: Hmph!  Hello, little critter! What's your name?\r\nMable: Don't stand too close to a squirrel, Billy. You'll catch it stupid.\r\nBilly: Okay, mom.\r\nSandy: Stupidity isn't a virus. But it sure is spreading like one.\r\nSpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid.\r\nSandy: Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, hi, Sandy.\r\nSandy: Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes.\r\nSpongeBob: We already talked about that, remember?\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, this is serious. Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, five minutes.  Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand?  Squirrels.\r\nSandy: Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around.\r\nSandy: I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, okay? Tell some of them other jokes you got.\r\nSpongeBob: Other jokes?  Bah! I got a million of them.\r\nSandy: Thanks, SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand.\r\nMr. Krabs: Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, hi.  Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish.  I guess you heard that one.\r\nSandy: I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water! I mean, the stuff's everywhere.\r\nPatrick: Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh...  Hey, what about this thing! Huh? Huh?\r\nFish #5: Get on with the squirrel jokes!\r\nSpongeBob: What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make: your friends  or your career.\r\nSpongeBob: Howdy, y'all!  How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?\r\nAll: Because they're so darn stupid!\r\nSpongeBob: My people!  But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy.  Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes.  Am I right?  Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you?\r\nSandy: I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport.  Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter?\r\nSandy: You were right, SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy.\r\nSpongeBob: You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends.  I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy.  Good morning, Sandy.\r\nSandy: Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, are you feeling alright?\r\nSandy: I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self!  Well, come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off!\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.\r\nSandy: Naw,  I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off.  Are them flowers for me? You even done got me a vase!\r\nSpongeBob: But, Sandy, that, that's not a...\r\nSandy: Ain't that purdy?\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, I need wa...\r\nSandy: Oh, that's right. Youse a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see, uhh...  Sea critters need, uhh...\r\nSpongeBob: Wa...\r\nSandy: Oh, wait, don't tell me. I know this one!\r\nSpongeBob: Wa...\r\nSandy: Wa...llet? Watch? Waffles?\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy! Water!\r\nSandy: Well, why didn't you just say so!  Here you go! Yup, us squirrels sure is stupid.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy!\r\nSandy: Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy! Okay, Sandy, I get it!\r\nSandy: What's that? You want more?  Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Sandy, okay! I get it!  No more squirrel jokes.  Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel.  And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.'  But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge!  I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae!  Look at me! I got no bones!\r\nFish #6: That's true.\r\nSpongeBob: Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!\r\nMr. Krabs: It's true, I am cheap!\r\nSpongeBob: Now, let me tell you about those fish? Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really!  Soap... soap... what is... soap?  And don't even get me started on starfish!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`32a\r\nPressure\r\nSandy: You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.\r\nSpongeBob: Yup, and just relax.\r\nSandy: Yeah. Relax.\r\nSpongeBob: Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?\r\nSandy: What?\r\nSpongeBob: A flower.\r\nSandy: They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.\r\nSpongeBob: They sure do.\r\nSandy: You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.\r\nSpongeBob: Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?\r\nSandy: Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob and Sandy: Me.\r\nSpongeBob: That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.\r\nSandy: Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See?\r\nSpongeBob: I thought that meant you were nuts.\r\nSandy: Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.\r\nSpongeBob: Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you think about that, \"Miss Mittens\"?\r\nSandy: I'd say I'm already halfway there!\r\nSpongeBob: Ahh!  Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!\r\nSandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey!  You did that on purpose!\r\nSandy: Yeah, but this is an accident!\r\nSpongeBob: Aaaaah!\r\nSandy: Too bad you forgot your umbrella!\r\nSpongeBob: I didn't!\r\nSandy: Well, it's about time you showed up.\r\nSpongeBob: I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!\r\nSandy: Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.\r\nSpongeBob: I can underwater! I'm...  Hydrodynamically designed!  Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?\r\nSandy: Why don't use ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you think of that, HydroPants?\r\nSpongeBob: I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there!  -halfway there!-halfway there!.\r\nSandy: Hey!\r\nSandy: Thanks for the face lift!  You see, I told you that you didn't-\r\nSpongeBob: There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature  waiting!\r\nSandy: I thought y'all wanted a rematch.\r\nSpongeBob: I did! And I took a head start like you did!\r\nSandy: Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess I don't, air breather!\r\nSandy: Water sucker!\r\nSpongeBob: Tree climber!\r\nSandy: Gulf streamer!\r\nSpongeBob: Kite flier!\r\nSandy: Chum chewer!\r\nSpongeBob: Take that back!

That proves it!\r\nSpongeBob: Proves what?\r\nSandy: That land critters are better than sea critters!\r\nPatrick: Better at what?\r\nSandy Cheeks: Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!\r\nSquidward: What's she blabbering about?\r\nPatrick: She says land creatures are best.\r\nSandy: Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur stylin' and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking  and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!\r\nSandy: And name calling, for sure!\r\nSquidward: And drowning, don't forget drowning!\r\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squidward!  Woo!\r\nSquidward: Not on your life, sport.\r\nSpongeBob: I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel.  But you're still just a land creature.\r\nSandy: Squirrels can do anything they want to!\r\nPatrick: I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite.  Ah.\r\nSandy: Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing.\r\nPatrick: Thank you, thank you.\r\nSandy: Well, there's just one thing.\r\nMr. Krabs: Can you do this?  Everyone in my family can do that.\r\nSandy: Uh...uh...\r\nSquidward: How about this?  Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Can you reproduce by budding.  Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya?\r\nSandy: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Most importantly...can you do this?\r\nSandy: Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?\r\nSpongeBob: Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if wasn't for that suit, you couldn't live down here!\r\nSandy: Well, you know...  I don't need to...  Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit!  And I don't need this helmet neither!\r\nMr. Krabs: Neptune preserve her!\r\nSquidward: How long can she stay like that?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know!\r\nPatrick: Sandy's a girl?\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe...  Yep, won't be long now.  Feelin' light-headed yet?\r\nSandy: Mm-mm.\r\nSpongeBob: Remember this?\r\nMr. Krabs: It's free!\r\nSandy: Stop laughing at me!\r\nMr. Krabs: I knew it! There was no way some \"airhead\" was gonna win anything against a water breather!\r\nPatrick: Airhead...  Huh?\r\nSpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!\r\nSandy: All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!\r\nSquidward: Do we have to wear pickle jars?\r\nSandy: Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.\r\nSpongeBob: One minute? No problem, Landy!\r\nSandy: Well? So are you going or not?\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, you know, but...\r\nSquidward: We can't, uh...because...\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, um... we're late for our...\r\nPatrick: Our fitting!\r\nSandy: Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!\r\nPatrick: Hey! We are not chicken!  Huh! My popcorn!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it.  There. Mission accomplished.\r\nSandy: Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!\r\nSpongeBob: No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!\r\nPatrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: Where not afraid of your dumb old land!\r\nPatrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: We're sea creatures!\r\nSpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay... Well, this is it.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait, boy!  Make it last.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay! Here I go!  Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up!

Thanks for coming.\r\nZoo Worker #1: You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster.  You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?\r\nSpongeBob: Uh...\r\nPatrick: No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Right.\r\nPatrick: Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like \"you\"... and... \"are\" ... and... \"a jerk!\"  Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?\r\nSpongeBob: I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!\r\nPatrick: Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!\r\nSpongeBob: Give it a rest, Patrick!

I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory.\r\nJohnny: Our top story tonight: giant oyster has its feelings hurt! The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut! And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry. A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world.  A cry that not only breaks the sound barrier, it breaks the hearts of our citizens!  What kind of cruel, careless, evil person would deliberately upset one of Neptune's most gentle creatures?\r\nGary: Meow?\r\nSpongeBob: No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something?  This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now.

The truth will be revealed!\r\nSpongeBob: I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!\r\nSandy: Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter!

Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!\r\nSpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?\r\nPatrick: I don't know. Why?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?\r\nPatrick: Yes!\r\nSpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Rawr!\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, it's not \"rawr!\"\r\nFlying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!\r\nSpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?\r\nSpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you.\r\nSquidward: I...no, I don't.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?\r\nSquidward: I never said that.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship.\r\nSquidward: Ow.\r\nFlying Dutchman: You're next!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: That was a close one!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Welcome back!\r\nSpongeBob: That was a closer one!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Welcome back!\r\nSquidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...\r\nFlying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?\r\nPatrick: Probably.\r\nFlying Dutchman: How 'bout now?\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSquidward: No, no, they're not. Whew.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Now listen.  Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever!  And, uhh , ever.\r\nSquidward: Will we be getting business cards?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.\r\nSquidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Would anyone else like to enter the \"Fly of Despair\"?\r\nSpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.\r\nPatrick: We'll do anything you say!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck!\r\nSpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!\r\nPatrick: And I got this hat!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!\r\nSpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...\r\nPatrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.\r\nSpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!\r\nPatrick: I don't get it.\r\nSpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...\r\nFlying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.\r\nSpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Get moving!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!\r\nFlying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear!\r\nPatrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!\r\nPatrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare.\r\nBilly: I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.\r\nPatrick: Moving behind the rocks!\r\nSpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.\r\nFlying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!\r\nSpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.\r\nFlying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!\r\nPatrick: How does he do that?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!\r\nBilly: Those guys are dorks.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks.\r\nSpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?\r\nPatrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!\r\nSpongeBob: Like movie passes?\r\nPatrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?!\r\nFlying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing!  This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.\r\nSpongeBob: You're setting us free?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner!\r\nPatrick: Wait, I have an idea!\r\nSpongeBob: Really?! What is it?\r\nPatrick: Let's leave!\r\nSpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department.\r\nPatrick: Let's do it.\r\nSpongeBob: I always hate going in there!\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait! Listen!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen...  Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!\r\nSpongeBob: Never!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Okay, then...  Give it to me!\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!\r\nPatrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.\r\nPatrick: Make it five.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Four.\r\nPatrick: Three. Take it or leave it.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?\r\nPatrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this!\r\nSquidward: Boy, I'm glad all that's over!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back!\r\nSpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one.\r\nSquidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!\r\nPatrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...\r\nSpongeBob: Well, that's not right because...\r\nFlying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.  Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...\r\nVoting Guy: All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!\r\nPatchy: Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be, Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good 'Ol SpongeBob.  My trusty crew, is eagerly awaiting your call. So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, And we'll be right back to announce, the winner!  Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it’s time for you to walk the plank!  Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner!  But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter ology, You didn't choose, Patrick.  But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh gaw!\r\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\r\nSpongeBob: That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSquidward: Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time...  Understand?!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSpongeBob: That's not gonna do it! Think harder!\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSquidward and SpongeBob: Come on! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Put on your thinking cap!\r\nPatrick: Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Thou wish is granted.\r\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?\r\nSquidward: You wished for gum?\r\nPatrick: Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!\r\nPatrick: Aaaah! Let us out!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Ahh, minty.\r\nPatchy: Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Molarchy! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh!  It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Eeny-Minie-Mo finger landed on Squidward!\r\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!\r\nSquidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?\r\nPatrick: No!\r\nSquidward: I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!\r\nFlying Dutchman: So be it.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSquidward: That's not what I meant!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner!\r\nSpongeBob: And what did you say your name was?\r\nSquidward: I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess.\r\nPatchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because its time to announce, the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is, SpongeBob!  Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!\r\nPotty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk!\r\nPatchy: And now, the most requested ending! Hooray!\r\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\r\nSquidward: Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian!\r\nSpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Hooray!\r\nSpongeBob: We're home!\r\nPatrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!\r\nSquidward: But why have we been turned into fruits?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy!  Hey, get back here with that!\r\nPatchy: Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It’s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lobbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now your an official big time cartoon decision maker!  Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!\r\nPotty: Sqwuak! I quit! I quit!\r\nPatchy: Ohhh! Oh, that's it, folks! Right now, I got a little employee management to take care of! Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage! Potty, I'm not kidding!\r\nNarrator: And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!

Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch!  Huh? \"New\" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry you had to see that.  Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath.  What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language!  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn.  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog?  ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house!  Ya-da-da-da...  That didn't work either, huh?  Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen...  40. The treasure must be in here!  Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub.  It's treasure. Look, doubloons.  Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!!  Get in the tub...  In the tub.  In the tub!  Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to...  Gary, could you...  Gary, no!  Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. . Come back, Gary. I have something to \"chair\" with you.  \"Dishes\" more like it. \"Water\" you waiting for, Gary?\r\nSpongeBob: Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin.  Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant.  I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: I am so the boss of you!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't use that tone of voice with me.

I've got a card game tonight.\r\nSpongeBob: Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton.\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton?!  But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy!  He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years!\r\nPlankton: Ouch.\r\nSpongeBob: Why would you play cards with him?\r\nMr. Krabs: Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!  Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years!  I never lose!\r\nSpongeBob: Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I lost.\r\nSpongeBob: Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?\r\nMr. Krabs: I didn't lose any money.  I lost...\r\nSpongeBob: Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!\r\nMr. Krabs: I lost...\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!\r\nMr. Krabs: I lost...  you!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nMr. Krabs: I bet your contract and I lost.\r\nSpongeBob: Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm afraid you don't work here anymore.\r\nSquidward: Please tell me this isn't a joke.\r\nSpongeBob: Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke.\r\nPlankton: As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking.  You work for me now, SpongeBob.  Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him!  I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!\r\nPlankton: What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship?  I would!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nPlankton: This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  Can I have my arms back?\r\nSpongeBob: What is this place?\r\nPlankton: Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty!\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...\r\nPlankton: Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now  and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef!  So get cooking.\r\nSpongeBob: The sign says \"kitchen\", but my heart says \"jail\". ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪\r\nMr. Krabs: ♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say.♪\r\nSpongeBob: ♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪\r\nMr. Krabs: ♪And fries should be fries, either way.♪\r\nSpongeBob: ♪But this grill is not a home.

All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.\r\nKaren: You know that never works! The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want.\r\nPlankton: Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.\r\nPlankton: Hi!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!\r\nPlankton: Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.\r\nPlankton: Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I usually cook on a grill.\r\nPlankton: You got it!  Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.\r\nPlankton: Say no more, I'll take care of everything.

That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.\r\nPlankton: Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Okay, go ahead, take it off!  It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!\r\nSpongeBob: It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs!  Oh...Mr. Krabs!\r\nPlankton: Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?\r\nSpongeBob: Well...there is one thing I've always wanted...  Wow!\r\nPlankton: So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Well...\r\nPlankton: You ready to make some patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream!\r\nPlankton: How about those patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Faster! Faster! Faster!\r\nPlankton: And then the littlest sea-elf said...  Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?\r\nSpongeBob: All this preparation is making me hungry.\r\nPlankton: Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.\r\nPlankton: Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?\r\nSpongeBob: No, I don't really feel like it!\r\nPlankton: But I don't understand.  You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair.  I rubbed your putrid feet!\r\nSpongeBob: Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!\r\nPlankton: I command you to make me a patty this instant!\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nPlankton: Don't back sass me!\r\nSpongeBob: Do ba da ma!\r\nPlankton: What?!  That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges.  Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants...  I put the brain in the robot, you know.  You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!\r\nSpongeBob: Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?\r\nPlankton: What? What?!\r\nSpongeBob: Get welded.\r\nPlankton: Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!\r\nSpongeBob: I don't wanna.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter.  Huh?\r\nPlankton: I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.\r\nMr. Krabs: Um...Well...  a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.\r\nPlankton: Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!\r\nMr. Krabs: How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.\r\nPlankton: It's a deal!

Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.\r\nPatrick: Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay! Why didn't you say so?\r\nSpongeBob: Hey! Another jellyfish!\r\nPatrick: It's Squidward, silly!\r\nSpongeBob: It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.\r\nPatrick: You're right, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: We can't let it go into town!\r\nPatrick: Poor Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey! My brain just hatched an idea.  This is gonna be classic!\r\nSquidward: I think I fancy a stroll around the park.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me!  Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie.  Ready for action!\r\nPatrick: He's going to the door.\r\nSpongeBob: He's knocking on the door. Squidward's answering the door and...\r\nSquidward: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\r\nPatrick: He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!\r\nSpongeBob: DoodleBoy, stop!\r\nPatrick: He's got the pencil.\r\nSpongeBob: What have I done? We've got to find him!\r\nSpongeBob: Where could he possibly be?\r\nPatrick: Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, let's go!\r\nPatrick: I'm not going in there\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there...\r\nPatrick: What just happened?\r\nDoodleBob: Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!\r\nPatrick: Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?\r\nSpongeBob: No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him.\r\nDoodleBob: Neofineyin!\r\nSpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Where's the leak, ma'am?  Yurrgh!\r\nSpongeBob: You okay, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Finland!\r\nDoodleBob: Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay!\r\nSpongeBob: There he is.\r\nPatrick: He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!\r\nSpongeBob: Ahem.\r\nPatrick: Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob! Heh heh.\r\nSpongeBob: He's putting down the pencil! This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him!\r\nPatrick: Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?\r\nDoodleBob: Bawahh bwah bwah wahh!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Do something!\r\nPatrick: Happy birthday!\r\nPatrick: Here's your present.  You're welcome.\r\nDoodleBob: Dewaaagheaugaaagh!\r\nSpongeBob: Hold it right there, Doodle. I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?\r\nDoodleBob: Bee ha, bala hala ba ba!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, what was that?\r\nDoodleBob: Bee ha, bala hala ba ba!\r\nSpongeBob: Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good.  Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...  I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil!\r\nPatrick: Take it easy. It's just a drawing.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Done and done.\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Good night, magic pencil.  Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water?   DoodleBob!  No hard feelings, right?   What do you think you're doing, doodle?!\r\nDoodleBob: You Doodle! Me SpongeBob!  Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen?  I nose.  Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn.  Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school.\r\nSquidward: Ouch! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!\r\nSpongeBob: Or maybe it was most clumsy.  Huh?  Paper!  Page for Mr. Doodle!\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?\r\nSpongeBob: Take a look for yourself, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: It's the evil Doodle!\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose.\r\nPatrick: So... he's a drawing?\r\nSpongeBob: Exactly! See how happy he is?\r\nPatrick: He still looks kind of creepy.\r\nSpongeBob: O, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Ready!\r\nFrench Narrator: We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.\r\nArtist: Huh?

The jellyfish don't catch themselves.\r\nPatrick: First, I have to put away my secret box.\r\nSpongeBob: Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box!\r\nPatrick: Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh!  Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life!\r\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.\r\nPatrick: You do?\r\nSpongeBob: I've got a gazillion secrets!\r\nPatrick: Like what?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.\r\nSpongeBob: You wanna hear one of my secrets?\r\nPatrick: Do I?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?\r\nPatrick: No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit naïve.\r\nPatrick: Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh.  Tell me some more secrets!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the…  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word \"fancy\" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now.\r\nPatrick: Gasp. I never would have guessed.\r\nSpongeBob: Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?\r\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box.  Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna…  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!\r\nSpongeBob: But, Patrick, I must know the secret!\r\nPatrick: For the last time, SpongeBob, no!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, just a peek?\r\nPatrick: Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!\r\nSpongeBob: But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!\r\nPatrick: Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?  The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom.\r\nSpongeBob: So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?\r\nPatrick: Friends.\r\nSpongeBob: What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?\r\nGary: Meeh… No.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, what do you know? You're a snail!\r\nPatrick: Seee... cret.\r\nSpongeBob: I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up.\r\nPatrick: Duh... who's there?\r\nSpongeBob: Shhh!\r\nPatrick: Eh?!  Who's that?!  Mmm... water.  Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside.  Nighty-night, boxie.\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper.\r\nPatrick: Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh…\r\nPatrick: It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box!  Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop!  It's me, SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.\r\nSpongeBob: No, really, Patrick! Look!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring: It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!\r\nPatrick: Our friendship ring! It is you!  How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?\r\nSpongeBob: If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside.\r\nPatrick: That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!\r\nSpongeBob: Really?\r\nPatrick: Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?\r\nPatrick: Well, didn't I tell ya?  Isn't it great?\r\nSpongeBob: It's just a string.\r\nPatrick: A secret string!\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!\r\nPatrick: Good night, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!

First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...\r\nHarold: Dude, can I have some ketchup?\r\nSquidward: Oh, here you go.  Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.

And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.\r\nJohnny: He stuck it!\r\nJohnny: And just look at that even coating.\r\nSpongeBob: Top that, Pinky.\r\nPlankton: Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!\r\nPlankton: Better than you!\r\nPlankton: Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!\r\nJohnny: Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.\r\nJohnny: Just look at that concentration.\r\nJohnny: Ooh, a little shaky on that entry.\r\nJohnny: But just look at that form!\r\nPatrick: Take that, yellow boy!\r\nSpongeBob: Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.\r\nPatrick: That's what you think, but it's not over yet.\r\nJohnny: It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold? Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't forget, he called ye yellow.\r\nJohnny: Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?\r\nPlankton: Don't forget, he called you pink!\r\nPatrick: Forget the Chum Bucket.

Now leave me to my work.\r\nSpongeBob: But, sir!\r\nPlankton: I thought I sent you away, cretin!\r\nSpongeBob: But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. ANYTHING!!!\r\nPlankton: All right, the sauce.\r\nSpongeBob: Wh-what?\r\nPlankton: The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...\r\nPlankton: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...\r\nPlankton: What's the matter with you? All I said was \"A little too much sauce.\" It's no big deal, really.\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...\r\nPlankton: What do you want from me, a promotion?!\r\nSpongeBob: A pro- a promo- a promotion?!\r\nPlankton: Uh, sure, kid, you're uh... you're on register now.\r\nSpongeBob: Register!\r\nPlankton: Glad that's over.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?\r\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!\r\nSquidward: Co-Cashier?!\r\nPlankton: So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?\r\nSquidward: You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to...\r\nSpongeBob: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...\r\nSquidward: Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!\r\nPlankton: So what do you want me to do about it?\r\nSquidward: I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.\r\nPlankton: Hope you like gray.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window!\r\nPlankton: Now, no more intrusions! I'd like to begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—\r\nPearl: Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!\r\nPlankton: Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!\r\nPearl: Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?\r\nPlankton: If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy.\r\nPearl: One dollar!? You hate me!\r\nPlankton: Ow!\r\nNat: You!\r\nPlankton: Me?\r\nNat: You think this is funny?\r\nPlankton: In a cosmic sort of way, yes.\r\nNat: Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?!\r\nPlankton: What? It's just an ordinary Krabby—  Oh, my goodness! Squidward!\r\nSpongeBob: I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did.\r\nPlankton: Oh, what now?\r\nSpongeBob: A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name!\r\nPlankton: I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?\r\nPearl: Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a new daddy!\r\nPlankton: Make it stop!  What, did I say the secret word?\r\nSpongeBob: No, sir, he's back.\r\nPlankton: Who's back? What?  What was that?!\r\nSpongeBob: Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover!\r\nPlankton: Take cover from what?!?\r\nSpongeBob: He's around here somewhere.  There he goes!\r\nPlankton: What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!\r\nHarold: Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.\r\nPearl: He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.\r\nSpongeBob: He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom.\r\nMr. Krabs: And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!\r\nPlankton: Krabs?! What the barnacle is going on here?!\r\nSpongeBob: It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.\r\nPlankton: That's terrible!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah! But the worst part is...\r\nPlankton: Good grief, he's naked!\r\nMr. Krabs: Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs!  No shirt, no shoes... no service!!!!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!  Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty!\r\nPlankton: I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?\r\nSpongeBob: Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech!\r\nMr. Krabs: Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!\r\nSpongeBob: You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, but I will! Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...\r\nSpongeBob: Phone call, Mr. Plankton.\r\nMr. Krabs: And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...\r\nPlankton: It's not worth it!

Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?\r\nPatrick: Just a minute, Ah!  I could have sworn I was laying on my back.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard.\r\nNancy Suzy Fish: Mr. Lifeguard, can I feel your muscle?\r\nLarry: Sure. Don't scratch the paint.\r\nScooter: Lifeguard, hows’s the tubage?\r\nLarry: Gnarly, dudes!\r\nScooter and friends: All right, yeah! Woohoo!\r\nElderly Man: Lifeguard, can you point out the snack bar?\r\nLarry: Right over there. But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.\r\nElderly Woman: So polite.\r\nElderly Man: Just like we raised him.\r\nSpongeBob: What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool.\r\nPatrick: Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies!\r\nNat: Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here.\r\nPatrick: I'm going to the snack bar.\r\nSpongeBob: Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  AND LIVE!\r\nLarry: Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers.  SpongeBob, you okay?  Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.\r\nSpongeBob: Lifeguard?\r\nLarry: The nose.\r\nSpongeBob: White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?\r\nLarry: Sure, there’s no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.\r\nSpongeBob: You really think so?\r\nLarry: You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?\r\nSpongeBob: (high voice) I'd love it!\r\nLarry: Alright.  Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here.  I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi.\r\nLarry: Hey, guy's a lifeguard.\r\nSpongeBob: It works.  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry.\r\nLarry: Yeah. Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?\r\nSpongeBob: By myself?\r\nLarry: Only if you think you're ready.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie.\r\nLarry: It's Larry.

You saved my life!\r\nLarry: Don't mention it. It's all part of the job.  You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people...  ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about.  Their lives are in your hands now, ‘cause I got a date with the tanning booth.  See ya.\r\nSpongeBob: But I...  ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes.  Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?  Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water!  Emergency!

No, don't go!  Free ice cream!  Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one?  A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming.

Did somebody say ice cream?  Where is it? Is it here?  Huh? Ice cream, yay!  Cramp!\r\nFish #4: Holy cow, somebody's drowning!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, that's not possible.

I spent it on a soda!  My best friend!\r\nSquidward: What? Would you get out of here?\r\nMr. Krabs: The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard.  Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.\r\nNat Peterson: Hey!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, girl, you're free to go.  I can't keep you anymore.

Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal!  Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.\r\nMr. Krabs: It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.\r\nSquidward: Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get that horse!\r\nSpongeBob: Mystery!\r\nMr. Krabs: Come back!\r\nSpongeBob: Mystery!

It's disgusting. They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.\r\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Good what?\r\nSpongeBob: Like you don't know.  Saying,  \"I hate Krabby Patties.\"  That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties.\r\nSquidward: Yeah, well, not me.\r\nSpongeBob: You're good at that.  Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha!\r\nSquidward: Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny. You know what we say.\r\nAll: The only people who don't like a Krabby Patty, have never tasted one!\r\nSquidward: That's me. Never had one, never will.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nSquidward: What?\r\nSpongeBob: What? What did you say?\r\nSquidward: I've never had a Krabby Patty and never will.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry...

That thing is a heart attack on a bun!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Squidward, I meant... good for your soul.\r\nSquidward: Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, just half.\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: A quarter?\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: One bite?\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Just smell it.\r\nSquidward: If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: One bite.\r\nSquidward: No...\r\nSpongeBob: You won't be sorry.\r\nSquidward: No!\r\nSpongeBob: It's delicious...\r\nSquidward: Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up?

Horrible! Putrid!  Poorly prepared! Vile! Unappetizing!

Get it?\r\nSpongeBob: But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. Nobody is immune to its tasty charms.\r\nSquidward: Nobody but me.\r\nSpongeBob: Are you sure?\r\nSquidward: Does this look unsure to you?\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nSquidward: Good! Now go spread the word!  Come on! Come on! Come on!  Ah... still alive!  Oh, soooo delicious!  Oh...! All the wasted years...!  I gotta have more. I gotta have more!  But wait!  After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then...

You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite.  Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.\r\nSquidward: Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.\r\nSpongeBob: Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  Well, whoever they were, they had great taste!  Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work!\r\nSquidward: What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage?\r\nFrank: I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full.

Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward!\r\nSquidward: What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?\r\nSpongeBob: No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs...!\r\nSquidward: My thighs?\r\nSpongeBob: ...and then you'll blow up!\r\nJoe: Yeah, I remember my first Krabby Patty.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`43b\r\nThe Bully\r\nSpongeBob: Excuse me, miss?\r\nNancy: I don't want to have to report you again.\r\nSpongeBob: I was just wondering...  ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself?

Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder.  Tell the class something about yourself, Flats.\r\nFlats: Well, I like to kick people's butts.\r\nMrs. Puff: What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like.  Okay class, as you remember last week...\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob!\r\nFlats: Hi, SpongeBob. I'm going to kick your butt.\r\nSpongeBob: That joke was almost funnier the second time.\r\nFlats: No. I mean it.\r\nSpongeBob: That time it almost seemed like...  ...you really did mean it.  Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Can I be excused for the rest of my life?\r\nMrs. Puff: Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.  Sorry, Mrs. Puff.\r\nMrs. Puff: Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats?  Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats.  Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey.  My, how very creative! We have an artist in the class.\r\nSpongeBob: I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy!  One, two, oh no, that's three! What am I going to do?  What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural.\r\nMartin: Oh that's real nice.\r\nSpongeBob: Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings!\r\nFlats: Hey, that story really speaks to me.\r\nSpongeBob: Really? What's it say?\r\nFlats: It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard.\r\nSpongeBob: ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this.

I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up.\r\nPatrick: No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you there?\r\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats.  I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny?  It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt.  Hello? Is this Pizza Castle?\r\nMrs. Puff: Come in, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?\r\nMrs. Puff: But why?\r\nSpongeBob: I can't tell you.\r\nMrs. Puff: Why ever not?\r\nSpongeBob: I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that.\r\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us.\r\nMrs. Puff: Of course.\r\nSpongeBob: Flats says he's going to kick my butt!\r\nMrs. Puff: What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine! This is an adult program. SpongeBob, just leave it to me.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you.\r\nMrs. Puff: Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.\r\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a big misunderstanding.\r\nSpongeBob: You what?!\r\nMrs. Puff: He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend.  And maybe play some sports with you on weekends.\r\nSpongeBob: I've got diarrhea!  Huh? Are you Flats' dad?\r\nFlats' Dad: Why, yes I am.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt.\r\nFlats: Dad, what're you doing?\r\nFlats' Dad: Uhh, nothing son.\r\nFlats: What did I tell you about talking to strangers?\r\nFlats' Dad: Now he's going to kick my butt!\r\nSpongeBob: Out of my way! Out of my way!  Can't you see he's gonna kick my butt?!\r\nLonnie: Hi there young people, nice day today.\r\nHarold: So, you like kicking butts, do ya? Well we'll show you, old man!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! \"BobPants SpongeSquare\". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after.\r\nFlats: Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey Flats, you feeling better?\r\nFlats: What? Where am I?\r\nPurple Doctorfish: Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure.\r\nFlats: Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt.  Those flowers for me?\r\nSpongeBob: He's still gonna kick my butt!\r\nHarold: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man!?\r\nLonnie: I love the young people!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!  Hang on, I'll transfer your call.  Who is it?  Flats!\r\nFlats: It's butt-kicking time!\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is.\r\nFlats: Let's do it!\r\nSpongeBob: Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly.\r\nFlats: Are you ready?\r\nSpongeBob: Hold on.  Okay, I'm ready.  I said I'm ready.  Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready.  That tickles.  Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you known what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow!  Flats, are you okay?  Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call...  ...'violence road'.\r\nMrs. Puff: Sorry I'm late, class, I...  SpongeBob!

It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed the health inspector.  It was a bright and sunny morning.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ah...That smells like...  ...the health inspector!  Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here!  If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.\r\nMr. Krabs: You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son?  Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him.\r\nSpongeBob: What can I get for you...handsome?\r\nMr. Krabs: We're doomed.\r\nHealth Inspector: I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.\r\nSpongeBob: Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything.\r\nMr. Krabs: Then we'll give him a smorgasbord!

Leave me to finish my work in peace.\r\nSpongeBob: And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?\r\nHealth Inspector: So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.\r\nSpongeBob: He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!\r\nMr. Krabs: Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear!\r\nJohnny Elaine: We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man, who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now.\r\nMr. Krabs: Free food?!\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.\r\nMr. Krabs: You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!\r\nSpongeBob: Duped!\r\nMr. Krabs: Bamboozled!\r\nSpongeBob: We've been smeckledorfed!\r\nMr. Krabs: That's not even a word, and I agree with ya!  Look at him. I bet he never changes his underpants.\r\nSpongeBob: I bet he bites whale bubbles.\r\nMr. Krabs: I bet his mom bought him that hat.  If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one.  You're dancin' with the crab man now!

Come to papa.\r\nMr. Krabs: Listen, he ate it!  Oh, look at him choke!  Look at him suffer!  Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face.\r\nA Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash. The fake inspector has been captured. Here is his picture.  If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.\r\nSpongeBob: Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.\r\nMr. Krabs: I don't think he'll be laughin', boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Why, sir?\r\nMr. Krabs: Because that patty killed him!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?\r\nMr. Krabs: What's this \"we\" stuff?

Why...why...why?!\r\nMr. Krabs: Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me.

It's not what you think!\r\nOfficer Nancy: What are you two talking about?\r\nMr. Krabs: We killed the health inspector, buried him, and then stuffed his body in the freezer.\r\nOfficer Nancy: You mean in here?\r\nMr. Krabs: It's empty?\r\nOfficer Nancy: Is this some kind of a joke?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah...a joke!\r\nOfficer Nancy: Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out.\r\nSpongeBob: It's the zombie!\r\nHealth Inspector: You guys should...\r\nOfficer Malley: Take that, you zombie!\r\nOfficer Nancy: I'll take it from here.

Huh? A brand-new television?\r\nSpongeBob: Easy... easy...\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!\r\nSquidward: Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.  Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?\r\nSpongeBob: Pretty smart, huh?\r\nPatrick: I thought it wouldn't work.\r\nSquidward: Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't you two have any brains?!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, we don't need a television.

There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that!  Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think!

While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, really, Patrick?  Did the snowball look like this?\r\nPatrick: Yeah.  This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?\r\nPatrick: Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, first, you have to make a snowball.\r\nPatrick: Oh, yeah. A snowball.  Oh, this is gonna be great!  Huh?  Wha...?  Aw...!

Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!\r\nPatrick: That's me!\r\nSpongeBob: I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!\r\nSquidward: Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity.

Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level.  If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it.\r\nPatrick: Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!\r\nSquidward: Hmm...\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's out.\r\nSquidward: Now there's something I'd actually like to see!  Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose.  Ahh. What's this?  Wha... I... no!  What are you doing? You're supposed to be  knocking each other's brains out!\r\nSpongeBob: We signed a peace treaty, Squidward.  You were right, fighting is for children.\r\nSquidward: No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There!

Now...\r\nSpongeBob: If you're in this war, then where's your fort?\r\nSquidward: I don't have one, okay? Now...\r\nPatrick: You got to have a fort, Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: Forts win wars, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Okay, fine! You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now...\r\nPatrick: That fort's too small, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...\r\nSpongeBob: He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.\r\nSquidward: Trust me, it's fine.\r\nSpongeBob: See, it is too small.\r\nSquidward: Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down.  See? Down here, I am perfectly...\r\nSpongeBob: Exposed.\r\nSquidward: Would you two please...  ...stop throwing...  ...snowballs?!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward returned fire!\r\nPatrick: Then it's war!\r\nSquidward: No-no... no, wait, wait, wait!

Oh yeah...  Incoming!\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I think Squidward's taking this really seriously.  That last one had his clarinet in it.\r\nSpongeBob: Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B.\r\nSquidward: What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire.  What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me!  I'll just fix that right now.  Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner!  There... Ha-ha!  But what about the possibility of an aerial attack!  I guess that ought to do it!  Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable!  Now, where are those fools?  Ha! The first shot has been fired!

Tough crowd.\r\nBill: Oh, now what's he doing?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!\r\nBill: We're losing our appetites!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.\r\nAll: We want patties!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa!\r\nAll: Boo!\r\nSpongeBob: No!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted.\r\nBill: Hey! Finally!\r\nNancy: That's what we've been waiting for.\r\nSpongeBob: They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks.\r\nAll: Yay!\r\nSpongeBob: You like that?\r\nBill: It's what we wanted all along.\r\nSpongeBob: It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns!  It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this?\r\nAll: Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm breaking new ground.

Holy fish paste, what is that?!\r\nMr. Krabs: That's the appetizer.\r\nSquidward: But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?\r\nMr. Krabs: Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea.\r\nSquidward: There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me!  Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Every sentence, every paragraph...  Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?!  My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax.  Little more.  Little more.  Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.\r\nSpongeBob: Empty my mind?\r\nSquidward: Empty your mind.\r\nSpongeBob: Empty my mind...\r\nSquidward: Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing.\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #1: Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!\r\nOther Smaller SpongeBobs: Everything?\r\nSpongeBob #1: Everything!  Come on, come on, come on! Bring 'em, bring 'em, bring 'em! Jellies, jellies!  Let's go, let's go! Keep doing it!  Come on, let's get moving!  Hurry up! What do you think I'm paying you for?\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #2: You don't pay me. We don't even exist. We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought.\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #1: One more crack like that and you're out of here!\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #2: No, please! I have three kids!\r\nSquidward: How do you feel?  SpongeBob?  This isn't working! I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time!  I'll just go to Squilliam's house and...  Squilliam, you're here!\r\nSquilliam: Hello, Squiddy!  We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.\r\nSquidward: Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!\r\nSquilliam: Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school,  are trying to pass off a lousy burger stand as a five-star...  ...restaurant!?  Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina...\r\nSpongeBob: Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately!\r\nSquidward: How did you do all this?\r\nSpongeBob: It was easy, once I cleared my mind.\r\nSquidward: But what about Krabs and Patrick?\r\nSpongeBob: Taken care of.  Right this way, please.  Good evening, sir.  From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg?  We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank.\r\nSquilliam: Mmm... this is fantastic!\r\nSpongeBob: Thank you, sir.\r\nSquidward: Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Ow!\r\nSpongeBob: If you need anything else, just call.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!\r\nSpongeBob: Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do.\r\nSquidward: It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face.  Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.\r\nSquilliam: Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!\r\nSquidward: In that case, I need you to read this.\r\nSquilliam: Uhh, \"Squidward Tentacles...\"\r\nSquidward: And I need you to wear this.\r\nSquilliam: Oh, eh, \"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest...\"\r\nSquidward: I'm sorry, one more time.\r\nSquilliam: \"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs.\"  Squidward, I must tell you...  Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name.\r\nSpongeBob: My name?\r\nSquilliam: Yes, your name, son.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh... Beef Wellington?\r\nSquilliam: No, your name.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh... err... the fork on the left?\r\nSquidward: Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.\r\nSpongeBob: My name?\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #3: What's his name?! What's his name?! I've got nothing on a name!\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #4: Come on, baby, what's the name?!?\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #5: We threw out his name!\r\nSquidward: I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that...\r\nSpongeBob: More soup for your armpit?\r\nSpongeBob: Please enjoy the food!  Would you like some cheese on that, sir?\r\nSquidward: No! Nooo!\r\nMr. Krabs: Run for your lives, everyone! It's the appetizer!\r\nSquilliam: Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.\r\nSquidward: Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!\r\nSquilliam: Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too!\r\nSquidward: Is that true?\r\nSquilliam: Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my balloon/casino!\r\nSpongeBob: Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?\r\nSquidward: Oh, the usual.  Would you get out of here!?\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`49a\r\nKrab Borg\r\nTV: We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.\r\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh?\r\nMr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to?\r\nRadio DJ: And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: \"Electric Zoo.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music.\r\nSpongeBob: I surrender! Oh.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?\r\nSquidward: I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order!\r\nSpongeBob: #17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?\r\nSquidward: Hilarious. Just deliver the food.\r\nSpongeBob: There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?\r\nThaddeus: No, I'm not.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!\r\nMr. Krabs: I feel completely recharged!\r\nSpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me.\r\nSpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels \"recharged.\"  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot! Nah.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.\r\nRadio DJ: Hmmm... which one, man?\r\nMr. Krabs: The one that goes \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.\"\r\nRadio DJ: No, man. You're thinking of \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?!  Boo-boo-bop?!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!\r\nSquidward: That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.\r\nSquidward: How did you...?\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: What is it, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.\r\nMr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?\r\nSquidward: Umm... yeah, sure.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?\r\nMr. Krabs: Why?\r\nSquidward: It was rated \"Arr!\" Arr! Because it's... about... pirates.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!\r\nSpongeBob: Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot!\r\nSquidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: What? What is it, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!\r\nSpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!\r\nSpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love.\r\nSquidward: No, wait, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: What is it, SpongeBob?!\r\nSpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\r\nMr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died!  Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas.  Me hard-boiled egg is ready!  I can already taste it. Come to Papa.  Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ahhh! Oh, my eyes!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr...\r\nSquidward: Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.\r\nSquidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?!\r\nSquidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!\r\nOperator: Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!\r\nSquidward: Not the Navy!  Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world!  Our world!  What do we do now?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know!  Hey, a nickel!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ah, that's better.  Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.\r\nSquidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.\r\nSquidward: They poop on the robot?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.\r\nSquidward: I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!\r\nSquidward: Shut up!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!\r\nSquidward: I said \"shut up!,\" you bucket of bolts!\r\nSpongeBob: I can't take it!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, are you okay?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!\r\nSquidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah.\r\nSquidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.\r\nSpongeBob: Right.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs.\r\nSquidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.\r\nSquidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am!

I am Mr. Krabs!\r\nSquidward: He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.\r\nSpongeBob: I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his \"little buddy.\"\r\nSquidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.\r\nMr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.\r\nSquidward: We're just gonna see what your \"little buddy\" knows.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!\r\nSquidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh?\r\nMr. Krabs: No! That cost me $24.95!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything.\r\nSquidward: Go get the toaster.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  Nooo!\r\nSpongeBob: This is the last robot, Squidward.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No!\r\nSquidward: I thought you said robots can't cry.\r\nSpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love.\r\nMr. Krabs: I loved it like it was me own.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?\r\nSpongeBob: The movie?

At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.\r\nPatrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., ...this would be kind of shocking.  Just call me Daddy!\r\nPatrick: It sure is cute when it's asleep.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.

Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?\r\nPatrick: No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.\r\nPatrick: Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.\r\nPatrick: Good, just don't pay me.\r\nSpongeBob: First, we need to set up the tarp.\r\nPatrick: Tarp ahoy!\r\nSpongeBob: We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.\r\nPatrick: That will never ever come off.\r\nSpongeBob: And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.\r\nPatrick: And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  Careful, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, the lid's already off.\r\nPatrick: Oh. Now it's my turn!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Well, that was a rip-off.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.\r\nNarrator: One hour later...\r\nSpongeBob: Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.\r\nNarrator: Two hours later...\r\nSpongeBob: I'm getting to the painting.\r\nNarrator: Three hours later...\r\nPatrick: Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.\r\nSpongeBob: No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?!  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!\r\nPatrick: Oh, I know!  Two giant paint bubbles!\r\nSpongeBob: Noooooo!  Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!\r\nPatrick: Nonsense!\r\nSpongeBob: Pat, no!  We did it!  We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--  Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?\r\nPatrick: Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!\r\nSpongeBob: That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!\r\nPatrick: I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it.\r\nPatrick: Oh, now I see it!\r\nSpongeBob: This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar…\r\nPatrick: Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!\r\nSpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said…\r\nPatrick: Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something!\r\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\r\nPatrick: Nope.\r\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\r\nPatrick: Nope.\r\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\r\nPatrick: Nope.  Oof! Oof! Oof!\r\nSpongeBob: Nothing's working!\r\nPatrick: Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen!  We have technology!\r\nSpongeBob: It didn't work.\r\nPatrick: This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...\r\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.\r\nPatrick: I don't see where you're going with this...  hey, a dollar!\r\nSpongeBob: Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  No…why'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!\r\nPatrick: Wanna bite?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!\r\nSpongeBob's reflection: You're on your own, pal.\r\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!\r\nMr. Krabs: What the…?\r\nSpongeBob: We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you.\r\nMr. Krabs: You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going...\r\nMr. Krabs: Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!\r\nPatrick: Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?\r\nSpongeBob: It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!\r\nPatrick: We didn't do it on purpose!\r\nBoth: Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!\r\nPatrick: I don't want to be butt-less!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned!\r\nDoll: Mama.\r\nMr. Krabs: And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go.  Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, you know, just hanging around.\r\nPatrick: Boo!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly.\r\nSpongeBob: No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!\r\nMr. Krabs: Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?!\r\nSpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!\r\nPatrick: We're so sorry!\r\nMr. Krabs: And then did you draw on it with crayon?!\r\nPatrick: I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, boys... you know what I've gotta do now?!\r\nSpongeBob: You mean our butts?\r\nPatrick: Can I use mine one last time?\r\nMr. Krabs: There we go, good as new.\r\nBoth: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!\r\nMr. Krabs: Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`50b\r\nKrusty Krab Training Video\r\nNarrator: Welcome aboard. If you're watching this video, then let me be the first to say: Congratulations!  You've recently been hired in the Krusty Krab  and this is your first official day of training.\r\nSpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now?\r\nNarrator: Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph...  Graph!  You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't get that way over night...  ...because the store closes at 6:00.  No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat.  But mostly his sweat.  From Humble Beginnings.  You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today.  And you're right!  After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless.  But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born.  Sounds like a lot of...\r\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!\r\nNarrator: Sounds like a lot of...\r\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!\r\nNarrator: Sounds like a...\r\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!  Hoopla!\r\nNarrator: Sounds like a lot of hoopla to make over a little Krabby Patty, right?  Wrong!  The Krusty Krab today.  To keep up with today's demanding customers, no expense has been spared to acquire all the latest achievements in fast-food technology.\r\nMr. Krabs: This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism.  Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch!  These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported.  This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine.  And most importantly,  You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.\r\nNarrator: All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it?  Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check.  But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder.  Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, \"Hello world! May I take your order?\" You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants! But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good.  Let's see, inattentive, impatient, a glazed look in the eyes.  Look carefully at the \"I Really Wish I Weren't Here Right Now!\" button. There's a name for employees like this, but we'll call him Squidward.\r\nSquidward: I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Sorry, can't hear you!\r\nNarrator: Training.\r\nSpongeBob: Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?\r\nNarrator: No, you can't make a Krabby Patty without understanding the phrase POOP.\r\nSpongeBob: POOP?\r\nNarrator: Once you understand POOP, you'll understand your place at the Krusty Krab. But what does POOP mean?  It's actually a carefully organized code. Watch closely. People Order Our Patties.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, POOP!\r\nNarrator: Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP.  Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.\r\nHarold: I'd like to order-\r\nNarrator: Do you think he's going to order: A: A sofa, B: An expensive haircut, or C: A patty?\r\nHarold: One patty please.\r\nNarrator: Ah, POOP! You never let us down!  Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.\r\nSpongeBob: Krabby Patty!\r\nNarrator: Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about: Personal Hygiene.  Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines.  Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift?  A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails.  And don't forget about the knuckles.  And make sure those palms are squeaky clean.  All right, let's see those hands.  Now that's thorough!  After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils,  and your hair is neat and tidy,  you are ready to start the day. Now let's see how Squidward prepares for his shift.  Remember, no employee wants to be a Squidward!  Now that you're clean and hygienic, I bet you think you're ready to make that Krabby Patty.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!  I'm ready!  I'm ready!\r\nNarrator: Whoa there! We have a few more topics to cover first.  Your Work Station.  It's important to keep your area tidy and free of droppings. But a clean workstation is only part of the job.  To make the vision in your head a reality, you'll need supplies. And a good employee always keeps his supplies well-organized.  Very nice, Mr. SquarePants, not a pickle out of place.  Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station.\r\nSquidward: Huh?  Oh!\r\nNarrator: Don't worry, Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you.  Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty.  Calm down.  There's plenty of time left. We have to make sure you're ready for the psychological aspect of the job: Interfacing with your Boss.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?\r\nMr. Krabs: No.\r\nNarrator: Good job, Mr. SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now-\r\nNarrator: Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer. Or as we like to say, the \"Krustomer\"!\r\nPatrick: Who said that? Are you a ghost?\r\nNarrator: Like precious, precious blood in an animal, the customer is what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive.\r\nPatrick: Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!\r\nSquidward: Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?\r\nPatrick: Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah...  Huh? What's that?\r\nSquidward: Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.\r\nNarrator: Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr. Krabs says.\r\nMr. Krabs: The money is always right!\r\nPatrick: The ceiling is right, Squidward. You're not a very good employee.\r\nSquidward: Fine. May I please take your order?\r\nPatrick: I'll have uhh... uhhhh...\r\nNarrator: We'll check up on these two later.  Right now, it's important that we discuss an emergency situation!  Like the lost gold of Atlantis, many consider the Krabby Patty to be a treasure. And as with every treasure, there's a thief ready to steal it. So it's up to you to be the watchful eyes of...  What's this?  It's Mr. Krabs business rival, Plankton!\r\nPlankton: Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine!\r\nNarrator: He's stealing the formula! What are you going to do, Mr. SquarePants?\r\nPlankton: You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into maximum overdrive!  Hi-ya!  I knew I should've gotten the turbo.  Hear me, Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead...\r\nNarrator: And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr. SquarePants.  Let's check in on Squidward again. Psst, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Huh?\r\nNarrator: Just remember POOP.\r\nSquidward: Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?\r\nPatrick: Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.\r\nSquidward: Will that be for here or to go?\r\nNarrator: Hang in there, Squidward, it's all part of the job.  Now that you've learned the basics of your training, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for.\r\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da-daa,\r\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-daa Da-da-da-la-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da-daa,\r\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, tssshh Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa-da-da a-da-daa,\r\nTi-ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ta-ta- la-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba- ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba-baa, Ti-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-taa,\r\nTi-ta-ti-li (gasps, then resumes)\r\nTi-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li- ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-ta-ti-ti- ta-ti-ti-taaaaa\r\nNarrator: Preparing the Krabby Patty!  At the center of every great dynasty is the crown jewel which keeps it alive and thriving.  For the Krusty Krab, this is the Krabby Patty.  And now you, the humble employee off the street, the all-too-necessary human resource that keeps this business afloat, will learn the sacred and dark secrets of how to prepare, with your very own hands...  the sumptuousness, lip-moistening, spine-tingling, heart-stopping pleasure center that is a Krabby Patty!

There'll be punch, cookies, explosions, and a brand-new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants!\r\nOld-time crowd: Hooray!\r\nNarrator: Now live, from Encino, California, get ready for a warm embrace from our party host, Patchy the Pirate!\r\nPatchy: Hey, get off my lawn! Party?  There ain't no party here. Go away!\r\nPotty: Bawk, come on in!\r\nPatchy: Hush, Potty, can't you see I'm trying to keep out the riffraff?\r\nPotty: Riffraff? That's our television audience, barnacle breath!\r\nPatchy: Oh, of course it is! I was just fooling! Welcome!  Say, you didn't bring SpongeBob with you, did you? I sure hope he got his invitation.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!\r\nPatrick: Me neither.\r\nSpongeBob: Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire.\r\nPatchy: Ah, well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid. She's cooling off on account of she's been dancing her scales off, isn't that right, Minnie, huh, takin' a little breakie poo?\r\nMinnie: No, Patchy. Actually, I'm in here because if I wasn't, I would die.\r\nPatchy: Ha, ha, that's the spirit!\r\nPatchy: Huh, let's see, who else haven't you met? That's Longbeard the pirate. Hey, there Longbeard, long time no see!\r\nNeptune: Who dares to interrupt Neptune?\r\nPatchy: Sorry about that, Neppy. That's Neptune.  He's king of the sea.  You kids having fun?  He-he.. whew! Hosting a party is hard work alright. That reminds me of a time when SpongeBob was hosting a party. Hey, you kids want to see that cartoon?  You do? Well then, launch the cartoon!\r\nNarrator: Ah, the Barg'n-Mart. A consumer's paradise of brand-like items, stocked as far as the eye can see.\r\nSpongeBob: Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!\r\nLou: Uh, that's great, SpongeBob. $1.42.\r\nSpongeBob: But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records.  19 seconds.\r\nLou: Okay, so it's a $1.42.\r\nSpongeBob: Sign here please.  Initial here, and here, and here, and here.  Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here!  Look at you, so young and happy!  Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\"? Hey Lou, how much?\r\nLou: For the Plan Your Own Party kit? Oh, we're having a special on those. Uh, they're free. But you have to leave... right now.\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see Gary, according to the \"Plan Your Own Party Kit,\" invitations are the first order of business.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: \"A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success.\" Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends.\r\nFred's dad: Who the barnacle is SpongeBob SquarePants?\r\nMable: I believe you went to kindergarten with him, dear.\r\nFred's dad: Kindergarten, huh?  Oh yeah, SquarePants. Well, I guess it's time to move again.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, Gary, this \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" is a real life-saver.  How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream.  Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world!  My piñata!  Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.  The \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Good question Gary, but not to worry. The \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule!  8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution.  At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades.  9:38: charity apple-bob.  9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice.  At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever!\r\nPatchy: Ha, ha! Looks like it's smooth party sailing for SpongeBob so far. Now it's time for me to get my own party underway! Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness.  Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.\r\nPotty: Bawk! How tacky.\r\nPatchy: It's a $40 value, Potty!  A $40 value! Now, it's very easy and loads of fun.\r\nSalt Water Sam: Hey, everybody, the band's here.\r\nPatchy: Band? What band?\r\nPotty: Bawk, the band I hired for the party.\r\nPatchy: A jolly idea, Potty. A little live musical get me shindig dug. Who'd you get?  Barnacle Bill and the Seven Seas?\r\nPotty: No.\r\nPatchy: Seaweed Sally and her Cackling Turtle?\r\nPotty: No.\r\nPatchy: Oh, oh, I know: The First Mates.\r\nPotty: No.\r\nPatchy: Saltwater Sam, featuring the Brine Brothers.\r\nPotty: No.\r\nPatchy: Uh, Rusty Hinges and the Boys from the Brig?\r\nPotty: They broke up years ago.\r\nPatchy: Well, who else is there?\r\nPotty: The Bird Brains!\r\nPatchy: Oh..\r\nPotty: The Bird Brains--They're better than all those other bands.\r\nPatchy: But they're just a bunch of birds.\r\nLead Singer: Hello, Encino!\r\nPatchy: Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ohh!  No, no, NO! Stop the music!  STOP! Look, boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time! I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.\r\nLead Singer: You mean we're fired?\r\nPatchy: No.  Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! Ha, ha, ha...  No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh!\r\nNarrator: While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come!  Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00.  Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed!  No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever!  Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late.\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?\r\nPatrick: Sure?\r\nSpongeBob: Did you have any trouble finding the place?  Here you are!\r\nPatrick: Thanks.\r\nSpongeBob: So, the punch okay?\r\nPatrick: Not bad, not bad.\r\nSpongeBob: Hmmm, nice weather we're having.\r\nPatrick: It's been very mild, yes.\r\nSpongeBob: Yep, it's mild season.  Ahem. So, you read any...  Oh, more party guests!  Welcome, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't mind if I do!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests!\r\nPatrick: Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, you dumb bunny, it says, \"Hello, my name is Patrick.\"\r\nPatrick: Nice to meet you Patrick.\r\nMr. Krabs: Good one, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Was he talking to me or you?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you made it!\r\nSquidward: My cable's out.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that.\r\nMr Krabs: So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Not bad.\r\nSpongeBob: I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47.  But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter.  Here are some topic cards to break the ice.  Oh, someone's at the door!\r\nScooter: Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!\r\nSquidward: This is lame.\r\nUnnamed Character: My card says, \"Discuss the philosophical nature of irony.\" What does yours say?\r\nPatrick: \"Nod politely.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: What does yours say, Plankton?\r\nPlankton: Oh, uh, it says,  'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.'  How interesting.\r\nMr. Krabs: Nice try, Plankton.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive...  22 minutes late!\r\nTom: Hey, hey!\r\nSpongeBob: Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position!  As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me!  Seriously.\r\nNarrator: (television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages.   Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Gare, got another coat for you.  The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to  work.  Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here?  This is all wrong! What's happening to my party?  No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm!  Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52!  Hey, what's this?\r\nSandals: That's my breakfast!\r\nSpongeBob: Could I have everyone's attention please?  Patrick!  If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks.  Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means!  Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this!  This is yesterday's paper.  I'll just go grab today's paper.  SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you?  Locked out?\r\nSandy: This song's got a great beat.\r\nPatrick: Yeah. Knock, knock.\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it.\r\nPatrick: So, do you come here often?\r\nMrs. Puff: No.\r\nPatrick: Hello, SquarePants residence. What?  I'm sorry, what?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: You wanna talk to SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!\r\nPatrick: Okay, hold on.  SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!\r\nSpongeBob: What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait!\r\nPatrick: Sorry, he's not out there.\r\nScooter: Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.\r\nPatrick: Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule!\r\nLarry: Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat!  Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind.  Hey, check out his crazy comb.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet.  I hope they don't touch my special comb.\r\nLarry: Well, I think I've aired it up enough.  Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.\r\nSpongeBob: I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events!\r\nPearl: Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely.  Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in!  Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned.  I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but...  ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in!\r\nOfficer John: Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?\r\nOfficer O'Malley: I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.\r\nOfficer John: You criminals make me sick.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!\r\nOfficer John: Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!\r\nOfficer O'Malley: You have a nice party now, sir.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.\r\nOfficer John: Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?\r\nSpongeBob: But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.\r\nOfficer O'Malley: Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge.  Oh no, these cuffs are broken.\r\nOfficer John: Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.\r\nSpongeBob: Is it too late to offer you some punch?\r\nOfficer O'Malley: Sir, you have the right to remain silent.\r\nSpongeBob: All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit!  Oh, yeah, the door's locked.  Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr!  Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster.\r\nPatrick: That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!\r\nSpongeBob: It was?\r\nPatrick: Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!\r\nSpongeBob: I am?\r\nPatrick: Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya!\r\nSpongeBob: SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all.  Gary!

What do you normally do while I'm gone?\r\nPatrick: Wait for you to get back.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?\r\nPatrick: Hey, that's a great idea!\r\nSpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!\r\nPatrick: Wow.\r\nSpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime.\r\nPatrick: And no line.\r\nSpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning.  And this is the Fountain Of Learning.  And these are the Lockers Of Learning.\r\nPatrick: And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?\r\nSpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning.\r\nPatrick: Where is everyone?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.\r\nPatrick: 6:20? But I thought you said you were late.\r\nSpongeBob: Late for being early.\r\nPatrick: Hey!  When did I start wearing a watch?\r\nSpongeBob: And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.\r\nPatrick: Ohh.\r\nSpongeBob: And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.\r\nPatrick: Ohhh.\r\nSpongeBob: And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.\r\nPatrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!\r\nSpongeBob: Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too.  There you are.\r\nPatrick: But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74.\r\nPatrick: Who said that?  Was it him?\r\nSpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.\r\nPatrick: What does he teach us?\r\nSpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.\r\nPatrick: Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Sorry.\r\nSpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?\r\nPatrick: I'm learning!\r\nSpongeBob: This is gonna be great!\r\nMrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?\r\nPatrick: Who's the fat kid talking to?\r\nSpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher.\r\nPatrick: Oh.\r\nMrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous.\r\nPatrick: Uh...uh...\r\nMrs. Puff: We just want to know your name.\r\nPatrick: Uh...uh...uh!...24!\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, great, another genius...\r\nPatrick: Why are they laughing?\r\nSpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing.\r\nPatrick: Oh.\r\nMrs. Puff: Today's first lesson will be on turning.\r\nPatrick: 24.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: What?\r\nSpongeBob: I thought of something funnier than 24.\r\nPatrick: Let me hear it.\r\nSpongeBob: 25.\r\nMrs. Puff: That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.\r\nMrs. Puff: Now then, \"Turning\"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least...\r\nSpongeBob: Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!\r\nMrs. Puff: What about the teacher?  As if I really look like this!  SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions.\r\nSpongeBob: No...\r\nMrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!\r\nMrs. Puff: You'll get this star back when you earn it...\r\nSpongeBob: No!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\r\nPatrick: Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?\r\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!\r\nSpongeBob: What, me? But why?\r\nMrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks a lot, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Sure thing, buddy.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?\r\nPatrick: Psst, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Just ignore him, SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, over here.\r\nSpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him.\r\nPatrick: Psst, SpongeBob.  Psst, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSpongeBob: HI?!\r\nMrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess.\r\nPatrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.\r\nSpongeBob: There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!\r\nPatrick: Who cares about a stupid star?\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!\r\nPatrick: I'll deal with you after class!\r\nSpongeBob: It is after class!\r\nPatrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you?\r\nSpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting!\r\nPatrick: Well, don't mind if I do!\r\nStudent: This is embarrassing.\r\nMrs. Puff: What's going on here?!  Well?\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting.\r\nMrs. Puff: Fighting?  Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend  to detention!\r\nSpongeBob: Detention!?\r\nMrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your souls.\r\nSpongeBob: In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: I hate you more.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd hate you no matter what.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd hate you even if that made sense.\r\nPatrick: I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out.  Huh?\r\nPatrick: Ohh...  Hmph.\r\nPatrick: Ohhhhh...!\r\nSpongeBob: Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!\r\nPatrick: I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry your apology is so long!\r\nPatrick: Me too! Let's save Roger!\r\nSpongeBob: I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet.\r\nPatrick: Ahh. Light bulb!  But why does it have to be so far away?  I'm coming, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth.  The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!\r\nPatrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm!\r\nSpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!\r\nMrs. Puff: Good job boys!  I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.\r\nPatrick: Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya SpongeBob. See ya Big Fat Meanie.\r\nRoger: Hey what'd I miss?\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`53b\r\nClams\r\nSandals: Uhh, what do you like better?

This is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir. You have just given me my one millionth dollar.\r\nSandals: Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?\r\nMr. Krabs: Nothing. Now get out.\r\nSandals: Uhh, what?\r\nMr. Krabs: Get out!

I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime. And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, a trip!\r\nSquidward: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where we going, Fancy Springs?\r\nMr. Krabs: No.\r\nSquidward: Pamper Island?\r\nMr. Krabs: Try again.\r\nSquidward: Ooh, ooh, ooh, Bikini Bottom Folk Village?\r\nMr. Krabs: Better than that!\r\nSquidward: Clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?\r\nMr. Krabs: Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?\r\nSquidward: No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?\r\nSquidward: How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nSquidward: Hey, watch where you're swinging that...  SpongeBob, be careful with... ow!  Okay, I've had enough.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose.  Me millionth dollar!  SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya.  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in. Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, ya stinkin' bilge rats! Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Here she comes...She made it!\r\nMr. Krabs: For a second or two, I thought she was a goner.\r\nSquidward: So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward! You're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back!  Never, never, never, never, never!\r\nSpongeBob: I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up.\r\nSquidward: Oh, puh-lease, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act.  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!\r\nMr. Krabs: You will? Great!

We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary.\r\nSquidward: We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar!

Look what we've got!\r\nMr. Krabs: Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, it's Coral Blue number-  three.\r\nMr. Krabs: I trusted you, and you gave me this? I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this.\r\nSquidward: No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.\r\nMr. Krabs: I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.\r\nSquidward: You're kidding?\r\nSpongeBob: Woo! Is it another fishing trip?\r\nMr. Krabs: No. It's this sandwich.\r\nSquidward: A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?\r\nMr. Krabs: Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.\r\nSquidward: Whatever. We've got plenty more to...  ...eat.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back.\r\nSquidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean?\r\nSquidward: Just look at him.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you—\r\nSquidward: Look again.\r\nSpongeBob: You're right. How do we get out of here?\r\nSquidward: If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nMr. Krabs: So, you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. \"It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice.\"  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you: live bait!\r\nSquidward: You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, he'll come.\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  you are completely out of your mind!  Get us out of here!\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives...

But it's not an ordinary special,  because today we go to Encino, California, as it was…  …100 million years ago! So prepare yourself for…  SpongeBob SquarePants B.C.!  Before Comedy.  With your host, Patchy the Pirate!\r\nPatchy: Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, \"Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave?\" Good question, you little…  Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times  …back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding you now.  It's stuck.  Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  It was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures.  Your clothes always match.  You can draw on the walls. And nobody yell at ya.  It was much easier to hit a baseball.  Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  Hey kids. Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is. Please welcome the Potty-dactyl\r\nPotty: Sorry I'm late.\r\nPatchy: Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume?  I stayed up all night making it!\r\nPotty: You're wasting your time, old man. Prehistoric stuff is lame. Everybody knows the future's where it's at.\r\nPatchy: What?!  That's not true. Don't mind him, folks. Why even SpongeBob SquarePants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say,  cool.\r\nPotty: No, he doesn't.\r\nPatchy: Yes, he does.\r\nPotty: Nope.\r\nPatchy: He most certainly does.\r\nPotty: No, he doesn't.\r\nPatchy: Yes, he does!\r\nPotty: No.\r\nPatchy: I know for a fact that he does!\r\nPotty: …not.\r\nNarrator: Meanwhile...\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob. What's wrong?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Mr. Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me.  And the parrot is winning.\r\nPatchy: Does.\r\nPotty: Doesn't.\r\nPatchy: Does.\r\nPotty: Doesn't.\r\nPatchy: Does.\r\nPotty: Doesn't.\r\nPatchy: Does!

Snellie will be winning this Sunday.\r\nPatrick: Sunday?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!\r\nSquidward: No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?\r\nSquidward: Papers.\r\nPatrick: Hmmm. 'Property of Squidward... Tentpoles.'\r\nSquidward: That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie.\r\nSpongeBob: You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.\r\nPatrick: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward!\r\nSpongeBob: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use.\r\nSandy: Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow.\r\nSpongeBob: Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché.  And nails for toughness.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time.\r\nPatrick: Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, your snail is a rock.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.\r\nSquidward: Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.\r\nPatrick: Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail.\r\nSquidward: Patrick, that's a rock.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.\r\nSquidward: What are you standing on, anyway?  Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow.\r\nPatrick: My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do.\r\nPatrick: You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race!\r\nNat: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.\r\nPerch Perkins: Hey, what are you doing?!  Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony.\r\nMayor: And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano!\r\nPerch Perkins: Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts...  ...for Larry.  He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.\r\nNarrator: Two hours later...\r\nPerch Perkins: He's almost a quarter of the way there.\r\nMayor: The torch is lit! Let the race begin.\r\nSquidward: Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations.\r\nSpongeBob: Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life.\r\nSquidward: I'll alert the paramedics.\r\nPatrick: Good one, Squidward.\r\nOfficial: You guys ready?\r\nPatrick: A burglar!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's the official.\r\nOfficial: We're ready to start here, folks.\r\nSquidward: Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.\r\nSnellie: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nPatrick: This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here.\r\nOfficial: On your mark. Get set.  Slither!\r\nPerch Perkins: And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!\r\nSpongeBob: What!\r\nSquidward: Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!\r\nSpongeBob: What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!\r\nPatrick: It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!\r\nPerch Perkins: And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.\r\nSpongeBob: Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!\r\nPerch Perkins: I do not like the look of this.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!\r\nPerch Perkins: That coach is pushing that snail too hard!\r\nSpongeBob: Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?\r\nPerch Perkins: Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout!  Oops, make that two, folks.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Gary?\r\nPerch Perkins: Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.\r\nSpongeBob: Umm, Gary, you can stop now!\r\nPerch Perkins: He's losing control!\r\nSpongeBob: You can take a break now if you want to, Gary.\r\nPerch Perkins: He's spinning out of control!  He's heading straight for the wall!\r\nSpongeBob: No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!\r\nPerch Perkins: Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen.\r\nSquidward: Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!\r\nSnellie: Meow.\r\nSquidward: What?!\r\nSpongeBob: Gary?  Oh!\r\nCrowd: Aww!\r\nPerch Perkins: My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary.\r\nSpongeBob: Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then...\r\nAnnouncer: And the winner is Rocky!\r\nSquidward: I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock.\r\nPatrick: Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.\r\nSquidward: Gosh, Patrick, thanks.  The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward...  ...Tortellini?! Will I ever win?\r\nSandy: That's for yesterday, SquarePants!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`55b\r\nMid-Life Crustacean\r\nRadio DJ: You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station.

For eternity!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm not cheap, I'm generous!\r\nSquidward: You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait just a burger-flipping second!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?\r\nSpongeBob: That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea.\r\nFlying Dutchman: He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.\r\nFlying Dutchman: You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?\r\nMr. Krabs: That depends, how much money we talking about?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nFlying Dutchman: 62 cents.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'll take the money.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents.  Next stop: Davy Jones' locker!\r\nMr. Krabs: Look, Squidward, money!\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?\r\nMr. Krabs: You think I could've gotten more?\r\nSquidward: He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money!  I want SpongeBob back!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Here, take him back.\r\nMr. Krabs: You heard what I said about the money?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds.  And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!\r\nSpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!\r\nFlying Dutchman: He's your problem now.\r\nMr. Krabs: Heh, about trading you for pocket change...\r\nSpongeBob: Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.\r\nMr. Krabs: You would have?\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Dutchman's residence.\r\nSpongeBob: So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`56b\r\nI Had an Accident\r\nPatrick: Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks.\r\nSandy: See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm listening to you, mountain!  Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Oh, yeah, I forgot.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, watch me do the \"Grouchy Squidward\".\r\nSquidward: Stop naming moves after me!\r\nSpongeBob: Everybody's an idiot except for me.\r\nSquidward: Well, it's true.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?  Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an...  Expert...!  Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down!\r\nSandy: SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!\r\nSpongeBob: Like this?\r\nPatrick: No, your other bottom!\r\nSandy: Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?\r\nPatrick: Not until 4.\r\nSandy: Ooh, that's gotta hurt.\r\nPatrick: Do it again! I wasn't looking!\r\nDoctor: Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.\r\nSpongeBob: My what has a what now?\r\nDoctor: Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing.  It took twenty hours to put it all back together.  We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick . Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there.   In the Iron Butt.\r\nTom: Aww, man. It itches.\r\nSpongeBob: You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol.  Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!\r\nHarold: What's your problem?\r\nSpongeBob: Whew. That was close.\r\nFootball Player: Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player.  Nice catch, Percy!\r\nJimmy: Hey, SpongeBob!  You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine!  Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.\r\nMartin: Next.\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nSquidward: Is this where the line starts?\r\nSpongeBob: My butt is not safe out here!  No part of me is safe!\r\nSandy: Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy!  Hey, SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: That was fun.\r\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world?\r\nSandy: Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again.\r\nSandy: That's crazy talk!\r\nPatrick: That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk.  Sorry.\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead.\r\nPatrick: Or your other armpit!\r\nSpongeBob: I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary.\r\nSandy: Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome?\r\nSpongeBob: I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin.\r\nSandy: Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab?\r\nSpongeBob: No problem!  A really long spatula.\r\nSandy: What about eating?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside!\r\nSpongeBob: Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again.\r\nPatrick: Never ever?\r\nSpongeBob: Never ever ever!\r\nPatrick: Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!\r\nSpongeBob: Never ever never never ever ever never!!\r\nPatrick: Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!\r\nSpongeBob: Never ever...\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Never never never never ever never ever never…\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door?\r\nPatrick: Thank you, Chip.  I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: No!\r\nPatrick: Aww!\r\nSandy: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of.\r\nPatrick: And that's when I  punch him, right?\r\nSandy: Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun.\r\nPatrick: I caught one!  Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting.  I think I caught one!\r\nSandy: We've got to try something else!\r\nSandy and Patrick: ♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!♪\r\nSandy: Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. ♪I know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!♪ Take it away, Penny!\r\nPatrick: That penny has the most beautiful voice.\r\nSandy: That is it, SquarePants!

Don't jump out until I give the signal.\r\nPatrick: Right.\r\nSandy: All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat!  Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year.\r\nSandy: No, really! You've got to come and save me!\r\nPatrick #2: Hey, Sandy,  who's your friend?\r\nSandy: But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.\r\nPatrick #1: I am in the gorilla suit.  I thought I was doing a pretty good job.\r\nSandy: If you're Patrick, then who's that?  Ah! A real gorilla!\r\nSpongeBob: ' Huh?!  Oh, my gosh!  This can't be happening!  This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about!  Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world.  I'm taking my  first step.  So far, so good. I think I can do this!  Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me!  I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now!  Is it too late to go back inside again?\r\n1st half of SpongeBob: It's too late.  Patrick? Sandy?\r\nPatrick and Sandy: Yes, SpongeBob?\r\n1st half of SpongeBob: I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.\r\nSandy: Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.\r\nFirst half of SpongeBob: You know what I don't understand though?\r\nSecond half of SpongeBob: What?\r\nFirst half of SpongeBob: What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place?\r\nGorilla: Oh!

But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.  You are a winner.  And today's the first day of summer!  Happy first day of summer, Squidward!  Care to join me for solstice caroling?  Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime!\r\nSquidward: I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.\r\nMr. Krabs: Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nMr. Krabs: Whee-hoo!\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?\r\nMr. Krabs: The money!\r\nSpongeBob: The money?\r\nMr. Krabs: Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh.\r\nMr. Krabs: You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break.\r\nSpongeBob: Tell me more about summer break.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!\r\nSpongeBob: I've been taught the true meaning of summer.\r\nNarrator: Later...\r\nSpongeBob: Almost closing time, Mr. K.\r\nMr. Krabs: What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there.\r\nMr. Krabs: Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: See anything, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart.  No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.\r\nMr. Krabs: True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do.\r\nSpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!\r\nSpongeBob: Krabby Land, sir?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?\r\nMonroe: Monroe.\r\nMr. Krabs: Nice to meet you, Monroe.\r\nMonroe: Whee!\r\nMr. Krabs: Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.\r\nKids: We promise.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land!\r\nKids: Yeah!\r\nTyler: Whoa! Ooh, where am I?\r\nMr. Krabs: Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability waivers!  Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!\r\nKids: Yay!\r\nMr. Krabs: Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.\r\nKids: We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!\r\nSpongeBob: Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.\r\nSpongeBob: Stall 'em? How do I do that?\r\nMr. Krabs: I don't know. Be entertaining.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, kids!\r\nMonroe: You're not Krabby the Clown.\r\nSpongeBob: No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!\r\nTyler: Lame.\r\nSpongeBob: Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?\r\nMonroe: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?\r\nTyler: Still lame.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.\r\nKids: You stink! Bring on the clown!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.\r\nKids: Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!\r\nSpongeBob: My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey, kids, check this out.\r\nKids: Woo-hoo!\r\nSpongeBob: I got 'em right where I want 'em.\r\nKids: Woo-hoo! Yeah!\r\nKids: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!  Yeah, woo!  Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!\r\nSpongeBob: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\r\nKids: Yay!  Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.\r\nMr. Krabs: Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: The kids are using them as... boomerangs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!\r\nSpongeBob: What are we gonna do?\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!\r\nSpongeBob: Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get out there and tell 'em!\r\nSpongeBob: Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!\r\nKids: Yay!\r\nSpongeBob: Who do you want?\r\nKids: Krabby!\r\nSpongeBob: When do you want him?\r\nKids: Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby!  Krabby!

Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!\r\nSpongeBob: I'll say you have.\r\nMr. Krabs SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.\r\nSpongeBob: But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?\r\nMr. Krabs: The children? I don't care about the children!  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose!  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest.\r\nKid: Ahem.\r\nMr. Krabs: Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.\r\nMonroe: Get him!\r\nSpongeBob: I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.\r\nSquidward: You mean this morning?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nMonroe: Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!\r\nKids: Yay! Hooray!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.\r\nKids: Hooray!\r\nSpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.\r\nMr. Krabs: Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!

And this isn't just any old weekend.  This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I'm scared!\r\nSquidward: Ho-ho, that would be great!  You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no...   What the...?  SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?\r\nSpongeBob: We are camping.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house.\r\nSpongeBob: Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside.\r\nSquidward: What do you mean, \"have fun inside\"?\r\nSpongeBob: Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.\r\nSquidward: Oh. Bye.  You little sneak! I see what you're doing!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nSquidward: Don't think I can't see what you're doing!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nSquidward: You're saying I can't take it!\r\nSpongeBob: But all I...\r\nSquidward: Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little \"have fun inside\" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside!\r\nSquidward: That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward's gonna come camping with us!\r\nSquidward: Now you'll see how a real... ugh!  ...outdoorsman does it!  Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn.\r\nSpongeBob: That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.\r\nSquidward: It isn't put up yet, you idiots!\r\nSpongeBob: Customization!\r\nPatrick: Genius!\r\nSpongeBob: He's tenderizing the ground!\r\nPatrick: Of course!\r\nSpongeBob: Write that down, write that down!\r\nSquidward: Huh? Voila!  But what could compare to just lying out under the stars?  Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?\r\nSpongeBob: Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows.  Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.\r\nPatrick: Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.\r\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.\r\nPatrick: Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going . Over.\r\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Patrick.  Me too.  SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over.\r\nPatrick: Yummy!  Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!\r\nSquidward: Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls , just as soon as I can get my can opener.\r\nSpongeBob: But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?\r\nSquidward: Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.\r\nSpongeBob: But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.\r\nPatrick: Pretty weenie!\r\nSquidward: All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.\r\nSquidward: Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one \"The Campfire Song Song\". ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪\r\nPatrick: ♪Bum! Bum! Bum!♪\r\nBoth: ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!

I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!\r\nSpongeBob: But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.\r\nSquidward: A sea bear? You mean like the ones that...  don't exist?!\r\nSpongeBob: What are you saying?\r\nSquidward: There's no such thing! They're just a myth.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer.\r\nSquidward: \"I Married a Sea Bear\"?\r\nPatrick: Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly!\r\nSquidward: \"Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real\"? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\r\nPatrick: Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...\r\nSquidward: You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.\r\nSquidward: Okay. Then what?\r\nSpongeBob: Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.\r\nPatrick: Flashlights are their natural prey.\r\nSquidward: You're kidding.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSquidward: Go on.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't ever eat cheese.\r\nSquidward: Sliced or cubed?\r\nSpongeBob: Cubed. Sliced is fine.\r\nSquidward: Yeah, yeah, and?\r\nSpongeBob: Never wear a sombrero...\r\nPatrick: ...in a goofy fashion!\r\nSpongeBob: Or clown shoes.\r\nPatrick: Or a hoop skirt.\r\nSpongeBob: And never...\r\nPatrick: Ever...\r\nSpongeBob: Ever...\r\nPatrick: Duh!\r\nBoth: ...screech like a chimpanzee!\r\nSquidward: Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off!\r\nBoth: They're horrible!\r\nSquidward: And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger.\r\nBoth: Why?\r\nSquidward: I don't know...  Just a feeling!\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nSquidward: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nBoth: Squidward, please don't!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt.\r\nPatrick: Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.\r\nSquidward: You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up?\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.\r\nSquidward: Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this?\r\nSpongeBob: No. Like that.\r\nthe screaming Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick are still huddled inside their anti-sea-bear circle\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, are you okay?\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back!\r\nPatrick: Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.\r\nSquidward: Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!\r\nBoth: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't run! Sea bears hate that!\r\nSquidward: Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.\r\nBoth: No!\r\nSpongeBob: They hate limping more than running!\r\nSquidward: Well, I guess I'll just have...\r\nSpongeBob: I should have warned you about crawling.\r\nSquidward: What'd I do that time?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.\r\nPatrick: Pretend to be somebody else!\r\nSpongeBob: Here, draw a circle.\r\nSquidward: Okay.\r\nSpongeBob: That was an oval. It has to be a circle!\r\nSquidward: Move over!  Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros!\r\nSquidward: What attracts them?\r\nPatrick: The sound of a sea bear attack.\r\nSpongeBob: Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh.

I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.\r\nTed: So, anyway, thanks for the pen.\r\nWaitress: No problem, hon.\r\nSpongeBob: It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.\r\nTed: I've gotta go.\r\nSpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gare?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!\r\nSadie: What is it, Peterson?\r\nPeterson: I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance.\r\nSpongeBob: That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Uh oh.  All right!\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Hi Patrick! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!\r\nWaitress: Wait a minute. When exactly did you lose your identity?\r\nTed: Yeah, and who's Patrick?\r\nDiner Chef: And why did you eat Snail-Po?\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.\r\nCustomer: Thanks, uh...  Oh.\r\nSpongeBob: Is there a problem?\r\nCustomer: Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.\r\nSpongeBob: While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh?\r\nSquidward: Uh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.\r\nSpongeBob: But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it?\r\nBank Robber: Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?\r\nSquidward: Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world?\r\nMr. Krabs: Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.\r\nSpongeBob: Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.\r\nSquidward: Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...\r\nSpongeBob: Cover me till I get back, okay?\r\nSquidward: Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey!\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning.\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, hi Patrick.  You said hi to me this morning, right?\r\nPatrick: As I do every morning.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I need you to do it again.\r\nPatrick: That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you talking about?\r\nPatrick: My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps.\r\nPatrick: You lost your name tag?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?\r\nPatrick: I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say \"hi\", just like this morning.\r\nSpongeBob: Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!\r\nPatrick: What?\r\nSpongeBob: You were supposed to say hi to me!\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh. All right, let's take it from the top.\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't forget your line this time!\r\nPatrick: I won't.\r\nSpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah.  Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!\r\nPatrick: What's my motivation?\r\nSpongeBob: Forget the motivation! Just say hi!\r\nPatrick: Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry.  I'm sorry. Let's try it again.  Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai...  Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people.  I've got the giggles.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.\r\nPatrick: Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?\r\nSpongeBob: Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys!\r\nPatrick: That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.\r\nPatrick: Well, then we'll look in the dumpster!\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, what is that stench?\r\nPatrick: That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost.  Hop on, pal.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.\r\nPatrick: I wish I had a nose.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.\r\nPatrick: Cannonball!\r\nSpongeBob: You look over there and I'll look over here.\r\nPatrick: Okay.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I'm looking. I'm looking.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick!\r\nPatrick: I'm looking as fast as I can.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick!  Thank you.\r\nPatrick: Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?\r\nSpongeBob: Have you  forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!\r\nPatrick: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.\r\nPatrick: Could I have another hint?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got  one minute till inspection.  One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time.\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob...\r\nSpongeBob: Not now, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: I know where your name tag is.\r\nSpongeBob: Where?! Where?!\r\nPatrick: Uh... I can't remember.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I don't have time for this!\r\nPatrick: There it is!\r\nSpongeBob: Where?!\r\nPatrick: Uh...  I forgot again.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you with me or against me?\r\nPatrick: Could you give me a hint?  There! I see it!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!\r\nPatrick: Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.\r\nSpongeBob: My shirt backward...  What the...?  My shirt's on backwards!  I had my identity all along.  Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Don't mention it, buddy.\r\nMr. Krabs: Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.\r\nSquidward: Hoorah.\r\nMr. Krabs: Okay, boy, your turn.\r\nSpongeBob: I think you'll find everything shipshape.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?\r\nSpongeBob: Uh... discovery?  And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story.\r\nWaitress: Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks, uh...  Betty.\r\nWaitress: What?  Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty.

Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!\r\nSquidward: Fascinating.\r\nMr. Krabs: But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.\r\nRobot: What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.\r\nSpongeBob: Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?\r\nSpongeBob: With pleasure, sir!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'll take this one.

Will this cover it?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, sure.  Here you go.\r\nRobot: Good day.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good.\r\nPlankton: AH-HAH!\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!\r\nPlankton: That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!\r\nMr. Krabs: Or what?\r\nPlankton: ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move.\r\nPlankton: Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\r\nMr. Krabs: And now for the chaser!\r\nPlankton: You just wait, Krabs!

Tell me what happened.\r\nPlankton: I don't want to talk about it.\r\nKaren: Talking will make you feel better.\r\nPlankton: Leave me alone.\r\nKaren: That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner...\r\nPlankton: And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.\r\nKaren: ...and that's why everything you try ends up like this...  and like this...  and more recently, like this.\r\nPlankton: I'm a failure!\r\nKaren: It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...\r\nPlankton: Henchmen?\r\nKaren: Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.\r\nPlankton: I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors!

No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.\r\nKaren: Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting.  Sorry.\r\nPlankton: That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  They're here!

Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.\r\nKaren: Okay, okay. I'm done. No more.\r\nPlankton: Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  Aha!  Okay, that's enough!  Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula.

This is your better speaking.\r\nMr. Krabs: What?!\r\nPlankton: I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ah, you and what army, bug?\r\nPlankton: What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: You planted grass?\r\nPlankton: GRASS?!?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton.\r\nPlankton: You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination.\r\nPlankton: Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left...\r\nMr. Krabs: Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!\r\nPlankton: Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!\r\nFamily: Ahem.\r\nPlankton: Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family.\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.\r\nPlankton: Begging won't help.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.\r\nPlankton: Eye.\r\nMr. Krabs: Eye.\r\nPlankton: I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good.  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! Wait!\r\nPlankton: ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm warning ya...!\r\nPlankton: ...A cup of love...!\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't do it!\r\nPlankton: ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?!\r\nMr. Krabs: I warned ya.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey. Why ain't you running?\r\nClem: Well, I can't read.\r\nMr. Krabs: Get out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, guys. Did I miss anything?\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?\r\nMr. Krabs: Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out.\r\nSquidward: Let me guess.

I wonder why he's still using his legs.\r\nMonroe: Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly!\r\nCap Fish: Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?\r\nNancy: Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.\r\nSpongeBob: Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!\r\nMother #2: You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?\r\nStubble Fish: I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers.\r\nNat: We all had dreams.\r\nNancy: What makes you so special?\r\nMob: Let's get him!\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nNat: Good riddance, dreamer!\r\nSpongeBob: Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon.\r\nFrench narrator:  Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned.\r\nSpongeBob: There they go again, Gary.  I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life.  Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true.  Back to reality.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: No, Gary, my dreams are silly.  Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What?  No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Momma? Well, listen up, Joe.  I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary!  I... I think I'm flying!

Where to, Mr. K?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh... my garage.\r\nSpongeBob: You've got it!  What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Are you sure you're up for it, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: I think my pants can handle it.\r\nMr. Krabs: I need you...\r\nSpongeBob: Yes?\r\nMr. Krabs: To clean...\r\nSpongeBob: Clean up crime?\r\nMr. Krabs: My garage.\r\nSpongeBob: That's your emergency?\r\nMr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly!\r\nSpongeBob: All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors!  All done, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: And the recyclables?\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, shrimp.  Finally!

Come on, everybody! I think a proper burial is in order.  A pair of pants like these come around... once in a lifetime.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it was fun while it lasted.

Wasn't that great, kids?\r\nPotty: Let's watch it again.\r\nPatchy: That's a great idea, Potty.  Where's the remote?  Where's the remote?  Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things...

Working here?\r\nSquidward: Yeah, great.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nSquidward: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: Aww, yeah.\r\nSquidward: Yes...\r\nSpongeBob: Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.\r\nStrangler: Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes.\r\nSquidward: How's it going, Lieutenant?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.  Yeah, just desserts.\r\nSquidward: Whatever. Huh?  SpongeBob, don't you know who that is?\r\nSpongeBob: Who?\r\nSquidward: That's the Tattletale Strangler.\r\nSpongeBob: Who?\r\nSquidward: The Tattletale Strangler!  He's promised to strangle anyone who turns him in.\r\nSpongeBob: He seems kind of angry with us, eh, Squidward?  Squidward? Squidward?\r\nOfficer Malley: You're gonna do time, Strangler. Hard time.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, officers. So, he's going to jail, right?\r\nOfficer Nancy: Who, Strangler?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, Strangler.\r\nOfficer Nancy: Oh, yeah, he's going to jail for a long time.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, that looks like me!\r\nOfficer Nancy: Don't worry, SpongeBob.

I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard.\r\nMr. Krabs: I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'! When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: This would be him, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: The Tattletale Strangler?  Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you!\r\nSpongeBob: Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard.\r\nStrangler: Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out.\r\nSpongeBob: You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture.\r\nStrangler: Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.\r\nSpongeBob: I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty.\r\nStrangler: Huh? Uh-oh. Uh, there's too many witnesses around here.  Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card.\r\nSpongeBob: Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?\r\nStrangler: Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man.  Or that baby.\r\nSpongeBob: Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium!\r\nStrangler: Huh? Uhh, that's mine.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?\r\nStrangler: Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...\r\nSpongeBob: We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!\r\nStrangler: Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected.  Perfect.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.\r\nStrangler: Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.\r\nSpongeBob: Quick is my middle name!  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'.

Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.\r\nStrangler: All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...\r\nSpongeBob: Protect me?\r\nStrangler: Thanks.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard.

Get your feet out of my eye sockets!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!\r\nNarrator: Six hours later...\r\nSpongeBob: Don't be mad, bodyguard.

The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.\r\nSpongeBob: You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him. Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got.\r\nFrank: Well, this came in just this morning.  Have some gum.  Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.\r\nPatrick: I don't get it.\r\nSpongeBob: What can we get for one dollar?\r\nFrank: One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar--  fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.\r\nSpongeBob: What else have you got?\r\nFrank: A whoopee cushion.\r\nSpongeBob: Nah.\r\nFrank: Fake vomit.\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nFrank: Real vomit?\r\nSpongeBob: Eww! Don't you have anything good?\r\nFrank: Well, there is one prank that I've been saving for a real top of the line prankster.  Invisible Spray!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, invisible spray!\r\nPatrick: But I can see it.\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, just think of the pranks we could pull with this.\r\nFrank: Good choice. Now be careful with that stuff, boys. It stains clothes.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Frank.  Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray.\r\nPatrick: What are we gonna do with it?\r\nSpongeBob: I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair.\r\nNat: They're floating in midair!\r\nTina-Fran: How do they do that?\r\nPatrick: That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, let's get started.\r\nPatrick: Okay, I'm ready.\r\nSpongeBob: Any particular reason you took your pants off?\r\nPatrick: Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?\r\nSpongeBob: That it does, Patrick, that it does.

Okay, Patrick, give me the can.\r\nPatrick: I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!\r\nSpongeBob: Give me that thing.\r\nPatrick: Hey, the invisible spray works!\r\nTom: And on your right, if you look, you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!\r\nPatrick: I gotta hand it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.\r\nSpongeBob: Righty, where are you?  No one messes with Righty!  We'll see how you like it!  Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?\r\nPatrick: Yeah.

Here, these are yours.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, forget the pants, Patrick.

Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?\r\nNat: Sure.  It's, uh, ten to three.\r\nSpongeBob: Thank you.\r\nNat: Don't mention it.\r\nPatrick: Don't mention what?\r\nNat: Uh, who said that?\r\nPatrick: Me.\r\nNat: Ghosts!\r\nPatrick: Hey, I'm no ghost!

Oh, it's the ultimate prank.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo! High five!\r\nSpongeBob: Let's go scare us some suckers!\r\nSandy: Huh?  Well, that's funny, I thought I heard voices. Huh?  I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table.  And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're ghosts.\r\nSandy: I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets.  It is ghosts!\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, we really scared her!\r\nPatrick: Who's gonna be our next victim?\r\nSpongeBob: A better question would be, \"Who isn't?\"\r\nMrs. Puff: Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake!

The whole town thinks we're ghosts.\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom--  Mr. Krabs.\r\nPatrick: It says he isn't scared of ghosts.\r\nSpongeBob: We'll see about that!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...  And his dried-up sea leprechaun.  And a bit of gold never hurt.  But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot,  got me shivering timber brace,  and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down.  And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor. And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon—the specter deflector!  So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Wha?\r\nSpongeBob: Krabs, we've come to haunt you.\r\nMr. Krabs: Stay back, I'm well-armed!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm warning ya!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ooh!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Boo.\r\nMr. Krabs: I gotta get out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.\r\nMr. Krabs: You'll never get me!\r\nPatrick: Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber!\r\nSpongeBob: Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets.\r\nMr. Krabs: Please, spirits, leave me be.\r\nPatrick: We got him good, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.  You're going to pay, Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, spirits, please!\r\nSpongeBob: Pay!\r\nMr. Krabs: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Pay!\r\nMr. Krabs: No! Don't burn me dollar!  Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick.\r\nSpongeBob: I know not these names of which you speak.\r\nPatrick: Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again.\r\nMr. Krabs: So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts.\r\nSpongeBob: We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me.  Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.\r\nMr. Krabs: Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.\r\nPatrick: Me too.\r\nMr. Krabs: Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now.
