Let me go!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer!  Back to the Chum Bucket with you!\r\nPlankton: You'll pay for this, Krabs!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh..Plankton, sir?\r\nMr. Krabs: Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug?  Okay.  Enough, lad, it wasn't that funny.  Get back to work!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!\r\nMr. Krabs: Good night, me boy!\r\nPlankton: Psst...young man.  Yes, over here. Come on, boy, a little closer.  Closer...  Not that close!  You blasted barnacle head! I mean...hi.\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton? What do you want?\r\nPlankton: I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?\r\nSpongeBob: Um...no.\r\nPlankton: Acquaintances?\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nPlankton: Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?\r\nSpongeBob: I...guess so.\r\nPlankton: You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment.  Ding!  Sparkle, sparkle.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.\r\nPlankton: It's a gift! A gift from a friend.  Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday.  And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? .\r\nSpongeBob: A booster seat?\r\nPlankton: Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those  tender...delicious...Krabby Patties!\r\nSpongeBob: You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow.\r\nPlankton: Gee, and I thought you were stupid.\r\nSpongeBob: You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me!  Even if we are friends!  Never, never, never, never!\r\nPlankton: Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally!

I guess I'm not wearing any pants today.  I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess.  You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up!

SpongeBob, are you mad?\r\nPlankton: Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.\r\nSquidward: Mediocre?\r\nPlankton: You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste!\r\nSpongeBob: Something must be wrong with my brain!  Plankton!  What kind of friend are you?\r\nPlankton: Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party!\r\nSpongeBob: Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!  Never! Never!\r\nPlankton: Toot toot! How about a little take-out?\r\nSpongeBob: No, never!  You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty secret formula!\r\nPlankton: You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, no!  There's no one here.\r\nPlankton: Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab!  And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player?\r\nSpongeBob: I must fight!\r\nPlankton: No, no, no, no.  There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it.\r\nKaren Plankton: Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed.\r\nPlankton: Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula.  And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty.  This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants?\r\nSpongeBob: I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down.  I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, you delicate little Krabby Patty.\r\nPlankton: Mmm...\r\nSpongeBob: With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness.\r\nPlankton: Steamy...\r\nSpongeBob: I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns.\r\nPlankton: Yes... yes... yes!  Come to papa!  Oh, boy...\r\nKaren: Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas.\r\nPlankton: Well, this stinks.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, patty, I guess we can go home now.\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty!

I'd get an ice cream!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, now what?\r\nPatrick: Hmmm...\r\nSpongeBob: This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies!  And now, duty calls!

I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself!\r\nOfficer #1: You know this guy?\r\nMrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility.  Uh-oh...  And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go.

I didn't need to see that.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.\r\nSquidward: How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish?  SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... for twelve hours!\r\nSpongeBob: Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed.

I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores?  And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night?  Ah! There's one now!\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space.

I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!\r\nPatrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite, too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!

Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.\r\nPatty: Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.\r\nSpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?\r\nPatty: Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...\r\nSpongeBob: Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.

Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls.  No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.\r\nSpongeBob: Do you mean I'm not scary?\r\nFlying Dutchman: You? Scary?!  Let me tell you about scary, kid.

My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!\r\nMrs. Puff: Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?\r\nGary: Meow.

You can talk!\r\nGary: In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.\r\nSpongeBob: What does that mean?\r\nGary: Come.  For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm.  \"Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again.\" Emily Dickinson wrote that.\r\nSpongeBob: Who?\r\nGary: Here's one you might know.  There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.\r\nGary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.\r\nGary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!\r\nSpongeBob: I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.\r\nPatrick: Yup.\r\nSpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?\r\nPatrick: Yup.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream.\r\nPatrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob.  Oh!  Shoot, that was my last quarter.\r\nSpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\r\nKing: Ahem!  Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?\r\nSquidward: Yes, Your Highness.  SpongeBob!\r\nKing: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play!  Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.\r\nSquidward: Sponge-  Bob...\r\nKing: I came here to hear beautiful music!

I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.\r\nSquidward: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\r\nFish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?\r\nSpongeBob: So long, Squidward!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder...\r\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?\r\nSandy: Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target.\r\nSpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!\r\nSandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay!\r\nSandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob!

This is your dream.\r\nPearl: You're just in time for the tea party!\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.\r\nPearl: Oh. He's next door.  Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?\r\nSpongeBob: Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust.\r\nKrabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon!

Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it!  Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go...\r\nSpongeBob: I can't!\r\nSquidward: What do you mean you can't?\r\nSpongeBob: I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever.\r\nSquidward: I never said anything like that!\r\nSpongeBob: Sure you did, Squidward, look.\r\nSquidward: Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me… ever!\r\nSpongeBob: Wanna see it again?\r\nSquidward: No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise.  Maybe I should get going.\r\nSquidward: Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something.  Yeah-yeah, something, something...  A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum.  I'm going to make you an offer.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, pocket lint!  You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...\r\nSquidward: Not the lint, the rubber band!\r\nSpongeBob: The rubber band? Do I dare?\r\nSquidward: Oh, dare, dare!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay...  Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise.\r\nSquidward: Listen, you!  You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal.  Gotta get that paper.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Trade...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, listen...\r\nSquidward: Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it.  I've given you everything but the shirt off my back.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise.\r\nSquidward: Okay, the shirt!  Take it! Take my shirt!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade!  I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, ‘cause this is all I'll need?\r\nSquidward: You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage.  I got it! Haha and you can't have it.  I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker!  At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose.  Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait...  Tada!\r\nChildren: Boo!\r\nSquidward: Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter!  Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now.  I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying...  ...flying.  Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground!  A guy stomping on the piece of paper  I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a...\r\nPatrick: ...a worthless piece of paper.  Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward.  Nice shirt, SpongeBob.\r\nSquidward: Does anybody have any sunscreen?\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`17a\r\nArrgh!\r\nMr. Krabs: Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!\r\nSpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich!

Where are the doubloons?\r\nSpongeBob: There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: \"The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt\".\r\nPatrick: Based on a real treasure map.\r\nSpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.\r\nPatrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty.\r\nMr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?\r\nSpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?\r\nSpongeBob: I already took care of it.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.\r\nPatrick: My turn.  Five.  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm.

One more game. I can smell the treasure.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta...\r\nMr. Krabs: That's awful, lad.

I wanna go to bed! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?\r\nMr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.\r\nSpongeBob: Pirates?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Treasure?  We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?\r\nSpongeBob: Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!\r\nPatrick: I'm Blind Beard the Pirate.\r\nSpongeBob: Ow.\r\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.\r\nSpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.\r\nSpongeBob: Okie dokie, then.\r\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, \"okie dokie, then.\" A pirate says, \"arrgh!\"\r\nSpongeBob: Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...\r\nMr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!\r\nPatrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land...\r\nMr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?\r\nSpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.\r\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, captain?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?\r\nPatrick: Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!\r\nMr. Krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the \"X\"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.\r\nPatrick: Ooh! East? I thought you said \"weast\"!\r\nMr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?\r\nPatrick: This one, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again.  9,551... 9,552...\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.\r\nPatrick: And hungry.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand!\r\nPatrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.\r\nMr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!\r\nMr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.\r\nPatrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.\r\nSpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.\r\nPatrick: I know.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?\r\nSpongeBob: He's not here.\r\nPatrick: Look! The treasure map.\r\nSpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Yeah...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\r\nPatrick: Nothing.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.\r\nPatrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?\r\nSpongeBob: No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\r\nPatrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?\r\nSpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?\r\nMr. Krabs: Do you think this is a problem?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?\r\nPatrick: We're sorry.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?\r\nSpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!\r\nPatrick: I think that.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!\r\nSpongeBob: Look! It's the \"X\".\r\nMr. Krabs: \"X\" marks the spot!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.\r\nSpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads. Heave!\r\nMr. Krabs: We finally found it.\r\nFemale Singers: The Dutchman's Treasure.\r\nAll: Wow!\r\nSpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?\r\nMr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!\r\nSpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!\r\nSpongeBob: What about loyalty?\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.\r\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\r\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\r\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.

So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow!\r\nFemale Singers: Two Gold Doubloons.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.\r\nMr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.\r\nFemale Singers: Plastic!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest.\r\nPatrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`17b\r\nRock Bottom\r\nSpongeBob: Another funtastic day at Glove World!\r\nBus Driver: Ahem.\r\nSpongeBob: Let me get my wallet.

You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna.  With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: We promise, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: I need a sailors promise.

Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew! Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm...hooked!

I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?\r\nSpongeBob: Of course not.  I mean, not exactly.  I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it!  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked!\r\nMr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.\r\nSpongeBob: What am I gonna do?\r\nMr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls.  D’oh, okay. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off.  There.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!\r\nMr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob.  But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise.  Please save me, Mr. Krabs!  I promise I'll be good!

Bring it on!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry. There's no danger.\r\nMermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: No danger?\r\nBarnacle Boy: Look, there has to be danger. You blew the conch signal.

The conch signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.\r\nBarnacle Boy: But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble. You got that?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sirs!\r\nMermaid Man: Good boy.\r\n{{L|Barnacle Boy|Come on, come on,  come on.

I'll destroy it when I get back to the  , uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...\r\nMermaid Man: Barnacle Boy,  don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow. Or the villain. Besides, I remember another  young  whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.\r\nBarnacle Boy: You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot.\r\nMermaid Man: Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility.  But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?\r\nBarnacle Boy: What?\r\nMermaid Man: To the Invisible Boatmobile!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh...\r\nSpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells,  Barnacle Boy laid an egg, The Invisible Boatmobile,  lost a wheel and...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey,  can I drive?\r\nBarnacle Boy: Drive?

On your toes.  Constantly alert. Always expect the unexpected.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey!  I've got the doughnuts!\r\nSpongeBob & Mermaid Man: ...and Barnacle Boy laid an egg. Hey-hey!\r\nMermaid Man: Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime...  ...just like that.\r\nAtomic Flounder: Help! Help! Help somebody here.\r\nSpongeBob: You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder.\r\nMermaid Man: Stop, kid. Stop! Let him go.\r\nSpongeBob: But you said he could snap...  ...just like that.\r\nAtomic Flounder: What?! Get off of me!  If I weren't retired, I'd, I'd...  ...do that.

How are those errands going?\r\nSquidward: What's that supposed to mean? I'm very busy.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm sure you are.\r\nSquidward: I don't like your tone.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sure you are.  How's that?\r\nSquidward: Just do your jobs!\r\nSpongeBob: Aye-aye, Mr. Tentacles.  Boy, no wonder Mr. Krabs put him in charge.\r\nSquidward: Must... re...  ...lax!  Look at yourself. You're losing your bluish glow. Stop worrying so much. Now, repeat after me. You will not go back to the Krusty Krab.\r\nMirror SpongeBob: I will destroy the Krusty Krab!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Have you finished...?\r\nSquidward: No!  That's it. That's it. No matter what sick fantasies run through my mind, I will not go back to that restaurant!\r\nSpongeBob: Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands?  Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands? Have you finished those errands?\r\nSquidward: No, I am not finished with those errands and I never will be, so quit checking up on me!  I know what you're up to.  Forcing me to come back here every time you mess up!\r\nSpongeBob: But I haven't...\r\nSquidward: Okay,  maybe you haven't messed up yet, but you will. You will...  And when you do, I'll be there. I'll be there!\r\nSpongeBob: Gosh, Squidward sure is a hard worker. He makes me proud to wear  these hats.\r\nSquidward: There!  Now I'll have to stay here and enjoy myself!  I'm not even gonna think about you-know-who at the you-know-what doing I-don't-care.  Just gonna... Relax.  Let Squid's day off... begin.   What was that?  It's SpongeBob. He's spying on me to see if I'm really doing errands.  But, but he left his post.  And I've finally caught him messing up.  Aha! I caught you, Sponge...  ... Branch.  Heh, here's that rubber duck Mr. Krabs wanted me to get.  I've got you now! Wait'll Mr. Krabs finds out you're a...  ... Toilet. You're losin' it, Squidward. Calm down. If I let this get to me again, I'll just end up running down to the Krusty Krab, bursting through the front door, up to that yellow headache SpongeBob, and he'll say...\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.  Are you finished with those errands yet?\r\nSquidward: Aha!  I know you're in here.  What?  He's heading back to the Krusty Krab!  I'll beat him there!  I've got you now, SpongeBob!\r\nSadie: Hey, put some clothes on!\r\nSquidward: The truth will be revealed!\r\nPatrick: Whoa-ho, right on, Squidward!\r\nPurple Doctorfish: Okay, Mr. Krabs. Get plenty of rest and if things don't seem right, come back.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thanks, Doc.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you can't beat me!  AHA! I caught you now! You didn't think I knew you were a stick outside my window! Ha! Or the toilet in my bathroom!  And then you were in my bathtub, and  I... and-and you... and I... and then you... swam... down the drain... and... beat me... to the Krusty... Krab.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, does that mean you're...?\r\nSquidward: Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do.\r\nSpongeBob: Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open\". . It's almost like we could've taken the whole day off!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`22a\r\nSomething Smells\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, it's Sunday, Gary!

Cherries... Boring.  Ah, here we go! Onions!  Ready, Gary?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Just one more thing! Pea...  ...nuts. Gary!  Our peanuts jar is totally empty!  Hmmm...  Wait! I know one other place we can find peanuts.  Good thing I still have these peanut plants growing in the windowsill.  A little texture never hurt. There we go.  This sundae's gonna taste great!

I'm confused.\r\nPatrick: Yes, I am.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, everyone is running away from me. Watch.  Hi, building!  I just don't get it.\r\nPatrick: I don't either.

You gotta be kiddin' me..\r\nPatrick: Better try the reflection test.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi.\r\nPatrick: Ugly.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no! I can't be ugly! I can't be! I can't be ugly!  Am I ugly?  Am I ugly?\r\nDriver: My eyes! My eyes!\r\nSpongeBob: Oof I'm ugly...\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, can I borrow some bath beads?  SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Go. Run away like all the others. No one would want a friend as ugly as I am.\r\nPatrick: Sure they would! It makes them feel better about the way they look! Maybe a story will cheer you up.  It's called, 'The Ugly Barnacle.'  Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end.\r\nSpongeBob: That didn't help at all.  How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: As long as I can remember. You poor ugly thing, you.\r\nSpongeBob: Help me! I'm so ashamed! I'm spiraling! I'm spiraling!  Thanks, Patrick.  It's okay, Patrick. Spiraling, over.\r\nPatrick: Just do what I do when I have problems.  Scream!  Come on, buddy. I'll help you.  Okay, now, say it.  Say it.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest.\r\nSpongeBob: I know, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Say it. Say it.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly.\r\nPatrick: You're ugly and what...?\r\nSpongeBob: Square?\r\nPatrick: No. Proud.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.\r\nPatrick: Good!

I'm ugly and I'm proud!\r\nSquidward: Is that what he calls it?\r\nSpongeBob: That felt great! I feel empowered.\r\nPatrick: So whaddya wanna do now?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know. How about a movie?  Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through.\r\nPatrick: People respect self esteem.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway.  Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.\r\nFred: Not at all, boy.  Deuueaugh!\r\nPatrick: Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a-  SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?\r\nSpongeBob: I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried,  but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide.\r\nPatrick: What is wrong with you people?!  Afraid to look ugliness in the face?  Well, here! Look at it!  It's ugly, isn't it?!  You look at it!\r\nSpongeBob: Hello.\r\nPatrick: You look at it!\r\nSpongeBob: Hi.\r\nPatrick: Look at it!  Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!\r\nSpongeBob: They all ran away, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: I bet there's no line at the snack bar.  Hello...? Hello...?

Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?\r\nClay: You tryin' to kill us?!\r\nPatrick: Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, is everything okay in here?  What are you doing in there, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Wouldn't you like to know?\r\nSpongeBob: And why is that bag on your head?\r\nPatrick: Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly!  What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!\r\nSpongeBob: Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.\r\nPatrick: That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick...?\r\nPatrick: What's my mom gonna say?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick!

Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.\r\nSpongeBob: But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.\r\nPearl: Exactly.\r\nSpongeBob: All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties,  happenin.'  Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.\r\nNazz: This is so cool!\r\nSpongeBob: Two salads.  That was awful.

If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one.\r\nSpongeBob: That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, back to the ol' grind.\r\nPatrick: Well, back to the ol' grind.\r\nSpongeBob: Forget my hat.\r\nPatrick: Uh, me, too.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Whew!\r\nSpongeBob: Dropped my spatula.\r\nPatrick: Uhh, me, too.

Gorgy smorgy.\r\nSpongeBob: At least I'm safe inside my mind.\r\nPatrick: At least I'm safe inside my mind.\r\nSpongeBob: Stop copying me!\r\nPatrick: There's no award for that!\r\nSquidward: Well, I guess it's safe to go in now.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?\r\nPatrick: Until I have as many awards as you.\r\nSpongeBob: We'll see about that!\r\nPatrick: No, we won't.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.\r\nPatrick: Me, too.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me.\r\nPatrick: Oh, no, you don't!\r\nSpongeBob: Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you.\r\nPatrick: My turn!\r\nSpongeBob: I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: What's so great about being a big pink loser?  Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Patrick...\r\nPatrick: Patrick's not here!\r\nDelivery Guy: Trophy delivery!\r\nSpongeBob: Another trophy?\r\nPatrick: Oh, great!  What's it for THIS time?\r\nSpongeBob: 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick! This trophy's for you!\r\nPatrick: Yay!  Eee!\r\nSpongeBob: So, what are you gonna do, now?\r\nPatrick: I'm gonna go protect my title.\r\nNarrator: So you thought I was kidding, huh?

Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.\r\nSquidward: I'm not taking an order for a bubble.\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.

And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...\r\nSquidward: Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!

Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset.

Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidward—looks like they're gonna replace you.\r\nSquidward: Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.

I mean, erosion.\r\nSpongeBob: You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five...

You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!\r\nSpongeBob: Why would I do that?\r\nSquidward: Because the pie you ate was a bomb!\r\nSpongeBob: What pie?\r\nSquidward: The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!\r\nSpongeBob: Pie...pie...

I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!\r\nImitation Krabs: Now why can't you tell me the formula?\r\nSpongeBob: It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle.\r\nPlankton: This is it, Plankton. Gently, now...\r\nImitation Krabs: Gasp!\r\nMr. Krabs: How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!\r\nImitation Krabs: Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. Remember: Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs.\r\nImitation Krabs: Don't listen to him. He's obviously a robot.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together.

Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer.\r\nMr. Krabs: Okay, then.\r\nSpongeBob: First question: What time does the Krusty Krab open?\r\nImitation Krabs: 9:30 A.M.\r\nSpongeBob: Right.  That's one strike, Mr. Fake.\r\nMr. Krabs: But...\r\nSpongeBob: Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two: How much does a Krabby Patty cost?\r\nMr. Krabs: $2.99!\r\nSpongeBob: On Wednesday...\r\nImitation Krabs: 99¢!\r\nSpongeBob: Right again!  You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this — If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?\r\nMr. Krabs: That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass?  Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance!  No!\r\nSpongeBob: So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye!  I knew it was you all along, Mr. Krabs, here you go.\r\nImitation Krabs: Thank you, SpongeDupe.\r\nSpongeBob: Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny.\r\nImitation Krabs: Yoinks.\r\nSpongeBob: This must be your lucky day.\r\nKaren: The self-destruct coin slot has been activated. Ten seconds 'til detonation.\r\nPlankton: Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeelp!  Ouch!\r\nSpongeBob: If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!\r\nMr. Krabs: Help! Get Away! No!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nHans: Mmm…yum-yum.\r\nMr. Krabs: Back, you hungry hand, back! Help!\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony.\r\nMr. Krabs: Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again.

Y'all never heard of Christmas?\r\nSpongeBob: Is she a friend from Texas?\r\nSandy: No. I can't believe you haven't heard of...  ...Christmas.\r\nSpongeBob: Tell me more about this...  ...\"Christmas.\"\r\nPatchy: And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus.\r\nSpongeBob: And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.\r\nSquidward: Yawn.\r\nSpongeBob: But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.\r\nPatrick: Just like a genie. (laughs)\r\nMr. Krabs: I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.\r\nSpongeBob: That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs.  Here you go! You can get started on your letter.\r\nSquidward: I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.\r\nPatrick: Like a genie.\r\nMr. Krabs: Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.\r\nSquidward: Oh, brother.\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, who's next?\r\nPatrick: Ooh, ooh, me, me!\r\nSquidward: Ooh.\r\nSpongeBob: Here you go, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: There's no words on this paper.\r\nSpongeBob: Not yet.\r\nPatrick: Yippee! A writing stick.\r\nSpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?\r\nSpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid...  ...ward.\r\nPatrick: Uhh, SpongeBob...  Thanks.  Dear Sant...  D'oh! Not again.\r\nSpongeBob: Here, Patrick, watch me. Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish.  Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!\r\nPatrick: Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?\r\nSpongeBob: Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.\r\nMr. Krabs: Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.\r\nSpongeBob: Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?\r\nMr. Krabs: A pony.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?\r\nMr. Krabs: With saddle bags full of money!\r\nPatrick: Here you go, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: What did you wish for, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Another piece of paper.\r\nSpongeBob: And what did you wish for, little girl?\r\nSusie: Front teeth!\r\nCowboy: I could use a new hat!\r\nJennifer-Millie: I need a new hairstyle!\r\nLonnie: How about a glass of water for my teeth?\r\nSquidward: Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.\r\nSpongeBob: Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?\r\nSquidward: My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.\r\nEveryone: Hooray!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: ♪It's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday.

Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? Say Santa Claus.\r\nSpongeBob: Santa Claus.\r\nSquidward: Aww, our first Christmas. This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas.  Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me.\r\nSpongeBob: You were right, Squidward. This is a stupid holiday.  I still want you to have this.\r\nSquidward: What? What's this?\r\nSpongeBob: A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! \"\"\r\nSquidward: Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...\r\nSpongeBob: You're welcome.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or...  his favorite underpants. Haha.  Why, it looks like a clarinet.  It smells like one, too. Handcrafted on driftwood. And it's even got my name on it.  What's this?  Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a...  big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I guess I won't be needing this.  That's better.\r\nSquidward: Poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.\r\nSpongeBob: I better get this stuff off of Squid's house.\r\nSquidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!\r\nSpongeBob: Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello?\r\nSquidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!\r\nSpongeBob: Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh?\r\nSquidward: Up here you dunce.

S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...\r\nSquidward: Hey, uh, kid, take it easy.\r\nSpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San... ta...\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!\r\nSpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...\r\nSquidward: Don't do that again.\r\nSpongeBob: I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly?\r\nSquidward: Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.\r\nSpongeBob: Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?\r\nSquidward: Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.\r\nSpongeBob: And what about that nose?  I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that thing's gigantic.\r\nSquidward: Alright! I'm Santa.\r\nSpongeBob: Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.\r\nSquidward: I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.\r\nSpongeBob: I did?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSquidward: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.\r\nShelly: Do you have a present for me, Santa?\r\nSquidward: Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...\r\nSpongeBob: Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.\r\nSquidward: Uhh, right, just a second.  C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect!  There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!\r\nShelly: Thanks, Santa.\r\nSquidward: That almost felt good.  I didn't... who?\r\nFred: Hey, Santa, where's my present?\r\nOld Man Jenkins: And mine!\r\nAbigail-Marge: And what about me?\r\nSquidward: Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people.  Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.\r\nJennifer-Millie: Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted.  A new hairstyle.\r\nSquidward: Here you go, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Wow.  A wrist watch.\r\nSquidward: What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane?  You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind.  And Santa is... oh, his belly was small but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...\r\nSquidward: Well, at least it's over.  Huh? What's this?\r\nSanta: Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus.  Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho.\r\nSquidward: Yup, I'm insane.\r\nSanta: Merry Christmas!\r\nPatchy: Dee dee, dee dee dee dee.\r\nSpongeBob: Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!\r\nPatrick: Presents, ahoy.\r\nSpongeBob: Hooray!  Oh, a storm!\r\nPatrick: Yay! I mean yikes!\r\nPatchy: Oh, we're going down!  Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel!\r\nMan on Set: Patchy?\r\nPatchy: Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure.  Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present.  Arr, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means.  Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate!  Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain!\r\nPotty: Give us a kiss!\r\nPatchy: No! No, not you!  No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this. Potty! No!\r\nPotty: Kissy, kissy!\r\nNarrator: Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him.

Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign?\r\nPatrick: Look, she's on the Eating Channel.\r\nSandy: Howdy!  If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation.  During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So do not disturb.  That means you, SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: We better put these on.\r\nSpongeBob: Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray.\r\nPatrick: When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? \"No\" means \"yes\"!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, look at this!\r\nSpongeBob: What is this stuff?\r\nPatrick: It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful.\r\nPatrick: What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Put your helmet back on!  You know there's no water in Sandy's house!\r\nPatrick: It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess you're right. It's okay here!\r\nPatrick: Take it off. No one's looking.  SpongeBob, did you hear that?\r\nSpongeBob: I think it came from Sandy's tree.\r\nPatrick: That is one tired tree.\r\nSpongeBob: Let's check it out.  Look what's in Sandy's bed!\r\nPatrick: Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!\r\nSpongeBob: I think this thing is Sandy.\r\nPatrick: Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.\r\nSandy: I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy...\r\nSpongeBob: She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws.  Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan.\r\nSandy: I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, you better run faster, Sandy.\r\nPatrick: Yeah! I'm getting away! Faster!\r\nSpongeBob: Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!\r\nPatrick: Faster, faster!\r\nSandy: I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics...\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore.\r\nPatrick: That's not disturbing. This is disturbing!  Hi there, SpongeBob. My name is Patback.\r\nSpongeBob: Ha! That is really disturbing!\r\nPatrick: Uh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nPatrick: Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy! No!

Don't wake up!\r\nSpongeBob: See ya later, Sheriff Sandy!  You're under arrest!\r\nPatrick: You'll never catch me!  Hey, that's not fair!

I just wanna be Patrick.\r\nSpongeBob: Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again!\r\nPatrick: Ouch!\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!\r\nPatrick: Let me have a try.  Open sesame!  Well, I've done all I can do.\r\nSpongeBob: Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring.\r\nPatrick: Barnacles.  Is it spring yet?\r\nSpongeBob: N-n-n-no.\r\nPatrick: I'm so cold that I'm shivering!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so cold...  that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks!\r\nPatrick: I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree!\r\nSandy: You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead!\r\nSpongeBob: The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?\r\nPatrick: Maybe she just ignores it.\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe...\r\nPatrick: Maybe...\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe it's her fur!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: Look at all that warm, toasty fur.\r\nPatrick: It's like a gold mine, but with fur.\r\nSpongeBob: Carefully...carefully?\r\nPatrick: Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!\r\nSpongeBob: All right, all right, hang on a second!  That should be enough, right?\r\nPatrick: Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I've lived a full life!\r\nPatrick: This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW!\r\nSpongeBob: Pat, no!\r\nSpongeBob: Pat, are you crazy?!\r\nPatrick: No, I'm warm.\r\nSpongeBob: Let me see that roll of tape.\r\nPatrick: Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits.\r\nSpongeBob: And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.\r\nPatrick: You said it!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Bring it on!\r\nSpongeBob: Spring?\r\nSandy: Wow, spring already?\r\nSpongeBob: Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!\r\nSandy: I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!\r\nSandy: Oh, look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!\r\nSandy: Hey, guys!\r\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Sandy.

I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend!  Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex!

I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me.  So loyal, so trusting, always by my side!  Who needs worms anyway?  Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy.  You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone who's name will not be spoken in this household.

But… we used to do laundry…\r\nPatrick: And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?\r\nSpongeBob: Soap? But… we used to use soap.  Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'…\r\nPatrick: Here it comes…\r\nSpongeBob: Du… du… duuuuu…  ttyyyyy!  Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you!  I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want.  If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up!  And the litter box? Forget about it!  The world is your litter box!  And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access!  And you don't even have to use a bowl!  And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward.  Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary?\r\nPatrick: How pathetic…\r\nSpongeBob: Gary…?\r\nPatrick: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself.  It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary?  He only liked me for my shorts!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: G-G-Gary?  Whee!  Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me!

Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year,  and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another  whole year of boating school!\r\nSpongeBob: What happened?\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian.  Minus 20 more points.\r\nSpongeBob: How many does that leave me with?\r\nMrs. Puff: Negative 224.\r\nSpongeBob: How many more minutes left in the test?\r\nMrs. Puff: The test is over.\r\nSpongeBob: That's enough time, I can make up those points!\r\nMrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me!  It's too late, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?\r\nMrs. Puff: Six.\r\nSpongeBob: Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?\r\nMrs. Puff: Six.\r\nSpongeBob: Whoo.\r\nMrs. Puff: Hundred.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nMrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got six.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry. I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year!  Well, see you next Tuesday!  Yeah!  I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year.  One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year!\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole!  Extra crediiiiit!\r\nSpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit!  I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.\r\nSpongeBob: What's extra credit?\r\nMrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh…..\r\nMrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit?\r\nSpongeBob: Extra credit!\r\nMrs. Puff: That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class, and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a ten-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.\r\nSpongeBob: But I've learned so many things.\r\nMrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started.  \"What I learned in boating school is…\" There! That's already seven words! Only three more!\r\nSpongeBob: L… e… a… r…  Oh, barnacles.\r\nMrs. Puff: What's wrong?\r\nSpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil.  N… e…\r\nMrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen.\r\nSpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils.  Gonna write an essay, that's what I say.  There.\r\nMrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it.\r\nSpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind!\r\nMrs. Puff: I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't look! It's not ready.\r\nMrs. Puff: It's so simple, only ten words! \"What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity,  Blank!\"\r\nSpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!\r\nMrs. Puff: \"What I learned in boating school is…!\" \"What I learned in boating school is…!\"\r\nSpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!  Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here?  My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop!\r\nMrs. Puff: You only need three… more… words!  Okay, let me see what you've written.\r\nSpongeBob: It's not ready yet.\r\nMrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nMrs. Puff: Give it to me!\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nMrs. Puff: Let me see it!  \"What I learned in boating school is…\" Uh…  Well, the rest doesn't matter!  You pass!  You pass!\r\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.\r\nMrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?\r\nMrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license.\r\nSpongeBob: My license!  It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-\r\nMrs. Puff: Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!\r\nSpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants!  SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants!  La La La La!  La La La La!\r\nFish: Ow!\r\nPartygoers: Harris, happy birthday!  My leg!\r\nNews Reporter: So much destruction...this reporter asks, \"Why?\" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who-  Oof!\r\nSpongeBob: La la la la!\r\nReporter: Let's- not- use that take.\r\nMrs. Puff: That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive.  Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.\r\nThe SquarePants': Surprise!\r\nSpongeBob: To the greatest teacher ever!\r\nMr. SquarePants: Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family.\r\nMrs. SquarePants: I think you made your point, dear.\r\nMr. SquarePants: Ahem.  Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!\r\nMrs. Puff: Well, I... Okay.\r\nMrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...\r\nMrs. Puff: See what?\r\nMr. SquarePants: Ta-da.  \"IM-RDY\".\r\nMrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?!\r\nSpongeBob: For me...?\r\nMrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff... He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!\r\nMrs. Puff: What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins.\r\nMr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, Son.\r\nSpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is!\r\nMr. SquarePants: We're gonna have to hold off on the driving there for a while, son.\r\nMrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Boaty.  Boaty, you're cold!  Take my socks.  Oh, Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea!\r\nMrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this.  Oh yeah…\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving!  Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing!  Oh my gosh, I know who you are!\r\nMrs. Puff: No, you don't! You don't know who I am!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, I do! I know that you're... a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray!  Somebody help me! Somebody help me!\r\nMrs. Puff: Sorry, SpongeBob, but it was for your own good.\r\nSpongeBob: Give me back my boat!  You'd better stop this boat!  I'm… not… letting… go! Nothing will stop me! Not even…  Giant clams?!  I'm… not… letting… go… not even for…  Cheese graters?!  If you think I'll let go just for a little…  educational television?! Oh, no!\r\nMrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes!\r\nSpongeBob as Radio: And now back to KRUD, with all of your personal \"you won't get away with stealing my car!\" hits.\r\nCop 1: Hey, look.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were…  … Mrs. Puff?  So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to… apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.\r\nSpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?\r\nMrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.\r\nSpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student . And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?\r\nMrs. Puff: What's that?\r\nSpongeBob: Free driving lessons!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`30b\r\nI'm Your Biggest Fanatic\r\nSpongeBob: Wow!

Good people have no use for weapons such as...  thoooose!\r\nMan Ray: The only thing I'm good at is being evil.  So long, suckers.\r\nPatrick: What's that smell, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.\r\nPatrick: Good, I thought it was my skin.\r\nSpongeBob: Forget about your skin, Patrick.

I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you.\r\nSpongeBob: I hope I do as good as that guy.\r\nDougie Williams: Man, those people will laugh at anything.

I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?\r\nSpongeBob: And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?  I mean, you chop them up into slices, but...  What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup?\r\nFred: Oh, brother, this guy stinks!\r\nHarold: Hey, hey, funny guy!

Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are?\r\nFish: That's true.\r\nSandy: Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things.  And what's up with all that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home, too.\r\nPatrick: Squirrel fur!\r\nSpongeBob: And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt.  Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?\r\nHarold: Why?\r\nSpongeBob: Because, they're so darn stupid!\r\nPatrick: That's a good one, huh, Sandy?\r\nSandy: Uhh, y-yeah...\r\nMr. Krabs: That was fantastic, boy.

Those jokes are hurtful and you know it.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom.\r\nSandy: Well, I can't argue with that.\r\nSpongeBob: We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time!\r\nSandy: You're right, SpongeBob. I was being a little too sensitive.  No hard feelings.  Okay, deodorant. Huh, let's see.

Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish.  I guess you heard that one.\r\nSandy: I haven't heard it!

But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy.  Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes.  Am I right?  Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you?\r\nSandy: I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport.  Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter?\r\nSandy: You were right, SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy.\r\nSpongeBob: You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends.  I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy.  Good morning, Sandy.\r\nSandy: Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, are you feeling alright?\r\nSandy: I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self!  Well, come on in!

Why don't you take a load off!\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.\r\nSandy: Naw,  I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off.  Are them flowers for me?

More water for the sea-critter!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Sandy, okay! I get it!  No more squirrel jokes.  Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel.  And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.'  But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge!  I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae!  Look at me! I got no bones!\r\nFish #6: That's true.\r\nSpongeBob: Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!\r\nMr. Krabs: It's true, I am cheap!\r\nSpongeBob: Now, let me tell you about those fish? Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo!

That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.\r\nSandy: Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See?\r\nSpongeBob: I thought that meant you were nuts.\r\nSandy: Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.\r\nSpongeBob: Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!

In what way?\r\nPatchy: Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.\r\nPotty: Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!\r\nPatchy: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh...  Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go?  Potty, you in here, buddy?\r\nPotty: Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.\r\nPatchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird!  Now, what was I saying? Now this cartoon ain't like most of your \"land-lobbing cartoons\". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to call the number their that's scrolling at the bottom of the screen...  No, not now! Don't call 'till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because-  Your not gonna make this easy are ya. Quiet! Vast their! Be laze that ringing! Stop! Its driving me mad!\r\nSpongeBob: Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!\r\nSquidward: That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away!\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!\r\nSpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?\r\nPatrick: How about...\r\nSquidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!  Now look what you've done!\r\nSpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean!\r\nPatrick: Clean...\r\nSquidward: Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.\r\nSpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top?\r\nSpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!\r\nPatrick: Squidward!\r\nNarrator: A few inches later...\r\nSpongeBob: Ship!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?\r\nSpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship!\r\nSquidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.\r\nSquidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.\r\nSpongeBob: Squid, wait!\r\nSquidward: All right, who owns this crate?  Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!\r\nSpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?\r\nPatrick: I don't know. Why?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?\r\nPatrick: Yes!\r\nSpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Rawr!\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, it's not \"rawr!\"\r\nFlying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!\r\nSpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?\r\nSpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you.\r\nSquidward: I...no, I don't.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?\r\nSquidward: I never said that.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!\r\nSpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship.\r\nSquidward: Ow.\r\nFlying Dutchman: You're next!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: That was a close one!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Welcome back!\r\nSpongeBob: That was a closer one!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Welcome back!\r\nSquidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...\r\nFlying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?\r\nPatrick: Probably.\r\nFlying Dutchman: How 'bout now?\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSquidward: No, no, they're not. Whew.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Now listen.  Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever!  And, uhh , ever.\r\nSquidward: Will we be getting business cards?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.\r\nSquidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Would anyone else like to enter the \"Fly of Despair\"?\r\nSpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.\r\nPatrick: We'll do anything you say!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck!\r\nSpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!\r\nPatrick: And I got this hat!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!\r\nSpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...\r\nPatrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.\r\nSpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!\r\nPatrick: I don't get it.\r\nSpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...\r\nFlying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.\r\nSpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Get moving!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!\r\nFlying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear!\r\nPatrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!\r\nPatrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare.\r\nBilly: I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.\r\nPatrick: Moving behind the rocks!\r\nSpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.\r\nFlying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!\r\nSpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.\r\nFlying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!\r\nPatrick: How does he do that?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!\r\nBilly: Those guys are dorks.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks.\r\nSpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?\r\nPatrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!\r\nSpongeBob: Like movie passes?\r\nPatrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?!\r\nFlying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing!  This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.\r\nSpongeBob: You're setting us free?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner!\r\nPatrick: Wait, I have an idea!\r\nSpongeBob: Really?! What is it?\r\nPatrick: Let's leave!\r\nSpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department.\r\nPatrick: Let's do it.\r\nSpongeBob: I always hate going in there!\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait! Listen!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen...  Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!\r\nSpongeBob: Never!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Okay, then...  Give it to me!\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!\r\nPatrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.\r\nPatrick: Make it five.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Four.\r\nPatrick: Three. Take it or leave it.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?\r\nPatrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this!\r\nSquidward: Boy, I'm glad all that's over!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back!\r\nSpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one.\r\nSquidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!\r\nPatrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...\r\nSpongeBob: Well, that's not right because...\r\nFlying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.  Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...\r\nVoting Guy: All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!\r\nPatchy: Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be, Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good 'Ol SpongeBob.  My trusty crew, is eagerly awaiting your call. So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, And we'll be right back to announce, the winner!  Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it’s time for you to walk the plank!  Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner!  But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter ology, You didn't choose, Patrick.  But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh gaw!\r\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\r\nSpongeBob: That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSquidward: Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time...  Understand?!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSpongeBob: That's not gonna do it! Think harder!\r\nPatrick: Uhh...\r\nSquidward and SpongeBob: Come on! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Put on your thinking cap!\r\nPatrick: Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Thou wish is granted.\r\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?\r\nSquidward: You wished for gum?\r\nPatrick: Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!\r\nPatrick: Aaaah! Let us out!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Ahh, minty.\r\nPatchy: Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Molarchy! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh!  It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Eeny-Minie-Mo finger landed on Squidward!\r\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!\r\nSquidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?\r\nPatrick: No!\r\nSquidward: I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!\r\nFlying Dutchman: So be it.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSquidward: That's not what I meant!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner!\r\nSpongeBob: And what did you say your name was?\r\nSquidward: I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess.\r\nPatchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because its time to announce, the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is, SpongeBob!  Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!\r\nPotty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk!\r\nPatchy: And now, the most requested ending! Hooray!\r\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\r\nSquidward: Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian!\r\nSpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Hooray!\r\nSpongeBob: We're home!\r\nPatrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!\r\nSquidward: But why have we been turned into fruits?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy!  Hey, get back here with that!\r\nPatchy: Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It’s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lobbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now your an official big time cartoon decision maker!  Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!\r\nPotty: Sqwuak! I quit! I quit!\r\nPatchy: Ohhh! Oh, that's it, folks! Right now, I got a little employee management to take care of! Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage! Potty, I'm not kidding!\r\nNarrator: And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special! Thanks for voting!\r\nPatchy: OW!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`33b\r\nGary Takes a Bath\r\nSpongeBob: Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time.  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch!  Huh? \"New\" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry you had to see that.  Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath.  What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language!  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn.  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog?  ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house!  Ya-da-da-da...  That didn't work either, huh?  Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen...  40. The treasure must be in here!  Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub.  It's treasure. Look, doubloons.  Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!!  Get in the tub...  In the tub.  In the tub!  Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to...  Gary, could you...  Gary, no!  Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. . Come back, Gary. I have something to \"chair\" with you.  \"Dishes\" more like it. \"Water\" you waiting for, Gary?\r\nSpongeBob: Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin.  Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant.  I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: I am so the boss of you!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say.  What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister.  Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One,  two,  two and a half...  don't make me say three!  Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!!  I'm a dirty boy.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, Gary.

I've got a card game tonight.\r\nSpongeBob: Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton.\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton?!  But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy!  He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years!\r\nPlankton: Ouch.\r\nSpongeBob: Why would you play cards with him?\r\nMr. Krabs: Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!  Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years!  I never lose!\r\nSpongeBob: Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I lost.\r\nSpongeBob: Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?\r\nMr. Krabs: I didn't lose any money.  I lost...\r\nSpongeBob: Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!\r\nMr. Krabs: I lost...\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!\r\nMr. Krabs: I lost...  you!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nMr. Krabs: I bet your contract and I lost.\r\nSpongeBob: Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm afraid you don't work here anymore.\r\nSquidward: Please tell me this isn't a joke.\r\nSpongeBob: Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke.\r\nPlankton: As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking.  You work for me now, SpongeBob.  Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him!  I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!\r\nPlankton: What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship?  I would!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nPlankton: This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  Can I have my arms back?\r\nSpongeBob: What is this place?\r\nPlankton: Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty!\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...\r\nPlankton: Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now  and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef!  So get cooking.\r\nSpongeBob: The sign says \"kitchen\", but my heart says \"jail\". ♪A stove is a stove, no matter where you go.♪\r\nMr. Krabs: ♪A patty is a patty, that's what I say.♪\r\nSpongeBob: ♪A grill is a grill, this is surely so,♪\r\nMr. Krabs: ♪And fries should be fries, either way.♪\r\nSpongeBob: ♪But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.♪\r\nMr. Krabs: ♪I would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.♪\r\nUnison: ♪This kitchen's not the same without you.♪\r\nMr. Krabs: ♪It's just a greasy spoon♪\r\nSpongeBob: ♪It's just a greasy spoon...♪\r\nUnison: ♪...without you.♪\r\nPlankton: What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.\r\nKaren: You know that never works! The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want.\r\nPlankton: Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.\r\nPlankton: Hi!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!\r\nPlankton: Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.\r\nPlankton: Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I usually cook on a grill.\r\nPlankton: You got it!  Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.\r\nPlankton: Say no more, I'll take care of everything.  How about here?\r\nSpongeBob: A little more to the left.\r\nPlankton: How's this, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Move it over a little more.\r\nPlankton: Here?\r\nSpongeBob: Keep going.\r\nPlankton: Here?\r\nSpongeBob: Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.\r\nPlankton: Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Okay, go ahead, take it off!  It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!\r\nSpongeBob: It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs!  Oh...Mr. Krabs!\r\nPlankton: Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?\r\nSpongeBob: Well...there is one thing I've always wanted...  Wow!\r\nPlankton: So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Well...\r\nPlankton: You ready to make some patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Wait ‘til I finish my ice cream!\r\nPlankton: How about those patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Faster! Faster! Faster!\r\nPlankton: And then the littlest sea-elf said...  Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?\r\nSpongeBob: All this preparation is making me hungry.\r\nPlankton: Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.\r\nPlankton: Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?\r\nSpongeBob: No, I don't really feel like it!\r\nPlankton: But I don't understand.  You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair.  I rubbed your putrid feet!\r\nSpongeBob: Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!\r\nPlankton: I command you to make me a patty this instant!\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nPlankton: Don't back sass me!\r\nSpongeBob: Do ba da ma!\r\nPlankton: What?!  That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges.  Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants...  I put the brain in the robot, you know.  You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!\r\nSpongeBob: Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?\r\nPlankton: What? What?!\r\nSpongeBob: Get welded.\r\nPlankton: Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!\r\nSpongeBob: I don't wanna.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter.  Huh?\r\nPlankton: I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.\r\nMr. Krabs: Um...Well...  a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.\r\nPlankton: Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything!

Oh, SpongeBob… if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life!\r\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.\r\nPatrick: You do?\r\nSpongeBob: I've got a gazillion secrets!\r\nPatrick: Like what?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.\r\nSpongeBob: You wanna hear one of my secrets?\r\nPatrick: Do I?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?\r\nPatrick: No... way.

Tell me some more secrets!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the…  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word \"fancy\" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now.\r\nPatrick: Gasp. I never would have guessed.\r\nSpongeBob: Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?\r\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh…  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box.  Nobody! Not even… Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna…  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box!

The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom.\r\nSpongeBob: So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?\r\nPatrick: Friends.\r\nSpongeBob: What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.

There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.\r\nSquidward: Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?\r\nPatrick: Oh, boy! Three A.M.!\r\nSquidward: Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here!  Very funny, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nSquidward: \"And the lights will flicker on and off.\" Just like the story. I get it.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?\r\nSquidward: I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!  What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?\r\nSpongeBob: Nice try, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Nice try, what?\r\nSpongeBob: \"The phone will ring and there will be no one there.\"  Oh, you crack me up.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I'm not doing this.  Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights,  and the phone,  and the walls will ooze green slime!  No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing?\r\nSpongeBob: I didn't know the buses ran this late.\r\nSquidward: They don't!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, they're dropping someone off.\r\nSquidward: The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...\r\nSpongeBob: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!\r\nSquidward: At last you understand! We're doomed!\r\nSpongeBob: No, that's not it.  I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!?\r\nSpongeBob and Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!\r\nSpongeBob: He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!\r\nSquidward: Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!\r\nRichard: Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula.  I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.\r\nSpongeBob: Do you have references?\r\nSquidward: Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights?\r\nSpongeBob, Squidward and Richard: Nosferatu!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`36b\r\nKrusty Love\r\nMr. Krabs: Da da dee.

I'll humor you. Go on, go out there and act \"smart\" for everyone.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, I will!\r\nPatrick: And don't worry, I'll keep this warm for ya!\r\nSpongeBob: I have a confession to make. I lied about being stupid. I just acted like a fool so you would appreciate Patrick a little bit more. I know how to talk, and eat, and do laundry. I even separate the darks from the lights. So what do you say we start over and try again? Hi! My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. And I am not a dummy.\r\nMarty: Amazing! Three minutes in the kitchen and our son has taught him to talk in complete sentences.  Oh, good work, son!\r\nPatrick: It wasn't easy, dad.\r\nSpongeBob: But... but, but, but, but, but, but...\r\nJanet: It looks like it's time for your next lesson, young man!\r\nSpongeBob: Now, listen to me! I'm not dumb! I have a brain! See? Here's a picture of it!\r\nPatrick: That must be actual size.\r\nSpongeBob: No! It's normal size and fully functional, watch.  2 plus 2 equals 4.\r\nMarty: Hoho, son! You taught him math, too!\r\nSpongeBob: Noooo!\r\nMarty: And you taught him to sing!  Oh, now he's short-circuiting! You must have taught him a little too much.\r\nMarty: You know, son, I've always known that when it comes to brightness, well, you're about a three-watt. But this guy! He's a wet match in a dark cave. He makes phone operators seem smart!  But more importantly, son, he's shown me what a sharp, quick-witted boy you've become.  Ha! I feel like I'm really meeting you for the first time. Isn't that right, Janet?\r\nJanet: You bet, Marty!\r\nPatrick: Janet?! Marty?! Who are you people?!\r\nJanet: Marty, I'm scared!\r\nSquidward: Excuse me. Does this lovely couple belong to you? They've been standing outside my house saying \"Where's Patrick?\" all day! It's driving me nuts!\r\nPatrick: Mom! Dad!\r\nHerb: Wow, son! You actually recognized us this time.\r\nMargie: And you remembered to get dressed today!\r\nMarty: Oh, that's right, honey.

Ok. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say circle one.

I'm a realistic Fish Head, and it's a beautiful day here at Bikini Bottom's Fast Food Coliseum.\r\nJohnny: They come from everywhere microwaves hum.\r\nJohnny: Patties sizzle.\r\nJohnny: And heat lamps keep the fast food spirit warm... and soggy. But the real story is the bitter rivalry between former competitors Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab and Plankton of the Chum Bucket.\r\nJohnny: Who could forget the year Mr. Krabs won gold for this five hundred pickle clean-and-jerk?\r\nJohnny: Not Plankton.\r\nJohnny: Or when Plankton won the hearts of millions by performing this perfect onion ring routine... with a broken antenna?\r\nJohnny: Krabs wasn't moved.\r\nJohnny: And now, late word is that this year, the Krusty Krab will be represented by a new competitor, on what is perhaps the greatest day of his young life.\r\nSpongeBob: This is perhaps the greatest day of my young life, Mr. Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't believe I'm representing the Krusty Krab in the Fry Cook Games.\r\nSpongeBob: To bring home the gold is to bring honor and glory to the Krusty Krab.\r\nMr. Krabs: And all that free publicity will bring in customers! So don't lose!\r\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!\r\nSpongeBob: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Patrick.\r\nKrusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab!\r\nPatrick: Are you trying to move the ground? You'll never move it like that. You gotta get under...  …neath it!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, I'm trying to train for the games.\r\nPatrick: Games? Can I play?\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, sorry, Patrick.\r\nSpongeBob: You have to be a fry cook.\r\nPatrick: Be a fry cook? Is that all I gotta do? That'll be easy!\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean easy?\r\nPatrick: How hard can it be?\r\nSpongeBob: They don't let just anybody be a fry cook. We're an elite corp!\r\nPatrick: Oh, come on. You're just flippin' patties.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, flipping is not as easy as it sounds!\r\nPatrick: Tssss...\r\nSpongeBob: Why don't you go home, Patrick? You can compete in the Laying Under a Rock All Day Games!\r\nPatrick: Well, at least I don't polish my fingernails.\r\nSpongeBob: You take that back!\r\nPatrick: Fingernails! Fingernails! Fingernails!\r\nSpongeBob: You don't even have fingernails.\r\nPatrick: I cannot believe what I am hearing!\r\nSpongeBob: How can you hear it? You don't have ears either!\r\nPatrick: Holes!

He's right.\r\nPlankton: I love messing things up.\r\nPlankton: Are you ready to do or die, Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Always ready, Plankton. Always ready.\r\nPlankton: Good. Because today, the Chum Bucket is going to kick...  ...your carapace!\r\nMr. Krabs: That's what you think, but I got me a champion. SpongeBob! Show him!  Look at him. In his prime. You ain't got no chance!\r\nPlankton: That's where you're wrong, Krabs, for I too have a champion.  Ladies and gentlemen, turn your attention to the southwest corridor!  Other way!  Imbeciles.  And... stop! Perfect.  Representing the Chum Bucket, a creature so fearsome, so terrible, so mind-bendingly large, that those of you with weak constitutions may want to leave the stadium.\r\nMuscular Fish: I gotta get outta here!\r\nPlankton: Too late! Ready or not, here he comes. Quake with fear, you mortal fools.

You're not a fry cook.\r\nPatrick: Oh, yes I am, Mr. SpongeBob SuperiorPants.\r\nPatrick: Check it out!\r\nPatrick: I've been working for the Chum Bucket for almost five minutes.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it doesn't matter anyway, 'cause you're gonna eat my dust.\r\nPatrick: Nuh-uh. I'm eating my own dust!\r\nSpongeBob: Not if I eat it first!\r\nPatrick: Yellow!\r\nSpongeBob: Pink!\r\nSpongeBob: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs.

Not in here, he ain't.\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean?\r\nPlankton: He's not really your friend.\r\nPatrick: He's not?\r\nPlankton: He's plotting your downfall right now!\r\nSpongeBob: He is?\r\nMr. Krabs: He's gonna stab you in the back.\r\nPatrick: He wouldn't!\r\nPlankton: Of course he would. Just look at him. Square: the shape of evil!\r\nMr. Krabs: He's making a mockery of your profession. Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nPlankton: Then get mean!\r\nPatrick: I'm mean!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get angry!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm angry!\r\nPlankton: Now get out there!\r\nMr. Krabs: And win...\r\nPlankton: That...\r\nMr. Krabs: Medal!\r\nHuge Fish: Ahhh.\r\nJohnny: Our first event, the deep fry pole vault.\r\nMr. Krabs: Win this one for the Krusty Krab.\r\nSpongeBob: For the Krusty Krab!\r\nPlankton: Win this one because I told you to.\r\nPatrick: Because you told me to!\r\nVendor: Fish sticks! Get your fish sticks here!\r\nJohnny: The next event: the chocolate high dive.\r\nSpongeBob: Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick.\r\nJohnny: For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks.\r\nJohnny: And now, absolute silence.\r\nSpongeBob: I scream for ice cream!\r\nJohnny: Perfect entry! And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.\r\nJohnny: He stuck it!\r\nJohnny: And just look at that even coating.\r\nSpongeBob: Top that, Pinky.\r\nPlankton: Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!\r\nPlankton: Better than you!\r\nPlankton: Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!\r\nJohnny: Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.\r\nJohnny: Just look at that concentration.\r\nJohnny: Ooh, a little shaky on that entry.\r\nJohnny: But just look at that form!\r\nPatrick: Take that, yellow boy!\r\nSpongeBob: Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.\r\nPatrick: That's what you think, but it's not over yet.\r\nJohnny: It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold? Mr. Krabs of the Krusty Krab?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't forget, he called ye yellow.\r\nJohnny: Or Plankton of the Chum Bucket?\r\nPlankton: Don't forget, he called you pink!\r\nPatrick: Forget the Chum Bucket. This is personal.\r\nPatrick: Noooo! My name's... not...

I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms,  they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so.

When am I gonna get some real food? Mr. Krabs gets to eat real food. Just look at his daughter, she's a big as a whale! I wish I could be successful like Mr. Krabs.  I wish I could somehow just switch lives with him. Just to know what it's like.\r\nKaren: Then why don't you just use that \"Switch-Lives-Just-To-Know-What-It's-Like-O-Mogrifier\" thing you built last Tuesday?\r\nPlankton: What a brilliant idea! Your parents must have been like, part computer or something.  Now, let's see here.  No...  no...  no...  A-ha!  Well, I hate to leave you, Karen, but you know what they say... a rolling stone gathers no algae!  Ahh...  Ugh... dear Neptune above, what happened last night? Huh, what's this?  Mr. Plankton?  Who the Davey?  Ehh... I'm in the Krusty Krab... and that means the life switcher was a success! The Krusty Krab is mine!  Corporate casual!\r\nSpongeBob: Order up! Two deluxe Krabby Patties.\r\nPlankton: At last!\r\nSpongeBob: There you are, sir. Two deluxe...  Ahoy there, Mr. Plankton.\r\nPlankton: Er, um, hey there, uh, SpongeBob. Uh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir!\r\nPlankton: I'm gonna need to take one of these Patties back to my office for um, bun inspection.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm afraid you can't do that, Mr. Plankton!\r\nPlankton: Why- why not?\r\nSpongeBob: Because that Patty is for the customer, sir!\r\nPlankton: The customer? I'll boil the customer in hot oil, and rip out his—  I mean, yes, of course, for the lovely... customer.\r\nSpongeBob: But you can take these Patties, sir. I made them in the off chance that you'd decide to instigate some bun inspection today, Mr. Plankton, sir!\r\nPlankton: Uhh... yes, uh, very nice. Um, thanks.  All mine, it's finally all mine! The Patties...  The wealth...  The notoriety! The...  SpongeBob, what do you want?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it's just that it's Tuesday again, sir, and I was wondering if I could have my, um... weekly performance review!\r\nPlankton: Review?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yes, please, sir, please!\r\nPlankton: But I've never reviewed anything... except those foreign exercise videos my cousin sent me.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, please, sir! I want to make you so happy and proud!\r\nPlankton: Eh, you're doing fine. Now leave me to my work.\r\nSpongeBob: But, sir!\r\nPlankton: I thought I sent you away, cretin!\r\nSpongeBob: But, sir, there's gotta be something I need to improve on. ANYTHING!!!\r\nPlankton: All right, the sauce.\r\nSpongeBob: Wh-what?\r\nPlankton: The sauce. I don't know. You're using too much sauce, okay? Review's over.\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...\r\nPlankton: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...\r\nPlankton: What's the matter with you? All I said was \"A little too much sauce.\" It's no big deal, really.\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh...\r\nPlankton: What do you want from me, a promotion?!\r\nSpongeBob: A pro- a promo- a promotion?!\r\nPlankton: Uh, sure, kid, you're uh... you're on register now.\r\nSpongeBob: Register!\r\nPlankton: Glad that's over.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, do you remember that little talk we had about 'personal space'?\r\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Squidward. I'm official, look!\r\nSquidward: Co-Cashier?!\r\nPlankton: So, have you two known each other long?  Huh?\r\nSquidward: You can't do this to me, Mr. Plankton! If you think I'm going to stand out there all day listening to...\r\nSpongeBob: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...\r\nSquidward: Then you must have coral wedged in your frontal lobe!\r\nPlankton: So what do you want me to do about it?\r\nSquidward: I'd like my view to be a little less yellow, if you know what I mean.\r\nPlankton: Hope you like gray.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, I can see you through this little window!\r\nPlankton: Now, no more intrusions! I'd like to begin writing the memoirs of my success story, so everyone just stay the—\r\nPearl: Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!\r\nPlankton: Just tell Daddy what you want! Oof! He's very busy!\r\nPearl: Could I please have a um... an advance on my allowance?\r\nPlankton: If it'll get you out of my antennae.  Go crazy.\r\nPearl: One dollar!? You hate me!\r\nPlankton: Ow!\r\nNat: You!\r\nPlankton: Me?\r\nNat: You think this is funny?\r\nPlankton: In a cosmic sort of way, yes.\r\nNat: Well, Mr. Funny Man, is this how you get your sick kicks?!\r\nPlankton: What? It's just an ordinary Krabby—  Oh, my goodness! Squidward!\r\nSpongeBob: I tried, Mr. Plankton. I really did.\r\nPlankton: Oh, what now?\r\nSpongeBob: A customer ordered a medium soda, and I gave him a large! I gave him a large! I've soiled the good Krusty Krab name!\r\nPlankton: I command you to stop that. Stop that and return to your post!  Where's the off button on this thing?\r\nPearl: Okay, Daddy. I've decided I'm gonna run away! Run away and find a new daddy!\r\nPlankton: Make it stop!  What, did I say the secret word?\r\nSpongeBob: No, sir, he's back.\r\nPlankton: Who's back? What?  What was that?!\r\nSpongeBob: Man your stations! Red alert! Red alert! Take cover!\r\nPlankton: Take cover from what?!?\r\nSpongeBob: He's around here somewhere.  There he goes!\r\nPlankton: What? Who? Where? Somebody tell me!\r\nHarold: Some say he crawled out from the lowest trench in the ocean.\r\nPearl: He's the saltiest of all the sea dogs.\r\nSpongeBob: He's the most hated creature in Bikini Bottom.\r\nMr. Krabs: And he's finally got a Krabby Patty! Ar, ar, ar, ar!\r\nPlankton: Krabs?! What the barnacle is going on here?!\r\nSpongeBob: It's your arch competitor, Krabs. His goal in life is to steal a Krabby Patty and ruin our restaurant.\r\nPlankton: That's terrible!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah! But the worst part is...\r\nPlankton: Good grief, he's naked!\r\nMr. Krabs: Clothe me if you can, silly landlubbers!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna make you eat those words, Krabs!  No shirt, no shoes... no service!!!!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!  Aw, ya got me! Well, at least it's underwire. Here's your stinkin' Patty!\r\nPlankton: I don't understand. Is there a gas leak in here?\r\nSpongeBob: Knick-knack, the Patty's back! You did it, Mr. Plankton. Victory screech!\r\nMr. Krabs: Enjoy your victory screech, Plankton, because someday the Krabby Patty formula will be mine!\r\nSpongeBob: You'll never get this formula, you twisted fiend!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, but I will! Even if I have to come back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...  And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...\r\nSpongeBob: Phone call, Mr. Plankton.\r\nMr. Krabs: And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day...\r\nPlankton: It's not worth it!

I could have sworn I was laying on my back.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard.\r\nNancy Suzy Fish: Mr. Lifeguard, can I feel your muscle?\r\nLarry: Sure. Don't scratch the paint.\r\nScooter: Lifeguard, hows’s the tubage?\r\nLarry: Gnarly, dudes!\r\nScooter and friends: All right, yeah! Woohoo!\r\nElderly Man: Lifeguard, can you point out the snack bar?\r\nLarry: Right over there. But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.\r\nElderly Woman: So polite.\r\nElderly Man: Just like we raised him.\r\nSpongeBob: What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool.\r\nPatrick: Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies!\r\nNat: Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here.\r\nPatrick: I'm going to the snack bar.\r\nSpongeBob: Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  AND LIVE!\r\nLarry: Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers.  SpongeBob, you okay?  Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.\r\nSpongeBob: Lifeguard?\r\nLarry: The nose.\r\nSpongeBob: White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?\r\nLarry: Sure, there’s no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.\r\nSpongeBob: You really think so?\r\nLarry: You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?\r\nSpongeBob: (high voice) I'd love it!\r\nLarry: Alright.  Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here.  I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi.\r\nLarry: Hey, guy's a lifeguard.\r\nSpongeBob: It works.  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry.\r\nLarry: Yeah. Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?\r\nSpongeBob: By myself?\r\nLarry: Only if you think you're ready.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie.\r\nLarry: It's Larry.

You saved my life!\r\nLarry: Don't mention it. It's all part of the job.  You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people...  ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about.  Their lives are in your hands now, ‘cause I got a date with the tanning booth.  See ya.\r\nSpongeBob: But I...  ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes.  Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?  Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water!  Emergency!

No, don't go!  Free ice cream!  Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one?  A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming.

You ate Old Man Jenkins!\r\nOld Man Jenkins: I don't want to be a burden.\r\nSquidward: Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.\r\nThaddeus: Where's our food?\r\nFred: I'm so hungry!\r\nTina: This is my only lunch hour!\r\nTom: Where's Old Man Jenkins?\r\nSquidward: Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.\r\nMr. Krabs: Squidward, what's going on in here?\r\nSquidward: Why don't you ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? Davey H. Jones!\r\nSpongeBob: Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda.\r\nOld Man Jenkins: What did I miss?\r\nMr. Krabs: So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend!\r\nSquidward: Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.\r\nSpongeBob: You do?\r\nMr. Krabs: I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.\r\nSpongeBob: What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda!  My best friend!\r\nSquidward: What? Would you get out of here?\r\nMr. Krabs: The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard.  Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.\r\nNat Peterson: Hey!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, girl, you're free to go.  I can't keep you anymore.  I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild.  Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore?  Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal!  Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.\r\nMr. Krabs: It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.\r\nSquidward: Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get that horse!\r\nSpongeBob: Mystery!\r\nMr. Krabs: Come back!\r\nSpongeBob: Mystery!

It's disgusting. They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.\r\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Good what?\r\nSpongeBob: Like you don't know.  Saying,  \"I hate Krabby Patties.\"  That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties.\r\nSquidward: Yeah, well, not me.\r\nSpongeBob: You're good at that.  Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha!\r\nSquidward: Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny.

Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.\r\nSquidward: Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.\r\nSpongeBob: Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  Well, whoever they were, they had great taste!  Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work!\r\nSquidward: What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage?\r\nFrank: I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full.

Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder.  Tell the class something about yourself, Flats.\r\nFlats: Well, I like to kick people's butts.\r\nMrs. Puff: What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like.  Okay class, as you remember last week...\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob!\r\nFlats: Hi, SpongeBob. I'm going to kick your butt.\r\nSpongeBob: That joke was almost funnier the second time.\r\nFlats: No. I mean it.\r\nSpongeBob: That time it almost seemed like...  ...you really did mean it.  Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Can I be excused for the rest of my life?\r\nMrs. Puff: Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.  Sorry, Mrs. Puff.\r\nMrs. Puff: Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats?  Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats.  Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey.  My, how very creative! We have an artist in the class.\r\nSpongeBob: I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy!  One, two, oh no, that's three! What am I going to do?  What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural.\r\nMartin: Oh that's real nice.\r\nSpongeBob: Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings!\r\nFlats: Hey, that story really speaks to me.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?

Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up.\r\nPatrick: No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you there?\r\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats.  I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny?  It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt.  Hello? Is this Pizza Castle?\r\nMrs. Puff: Come in, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?\r\nMrs. Puff: But why?\r\nSpongeBob: I can't tell you.\r\nMrs. Puff: Why ever not?\r\nSpongeBob: I just can't, Mrs. Puff.

But only if you promise to keep it between us.\r\nMrs. Puff: Of course.\r\nSpongeBob: Flats says he's going to kick my butt!\r\nMrs. Puff: What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine!

It was all a big misunderstanding.\r\nSpongeBob: You what?!\r\nMrs. Puff: He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend.  And maybe play some sports with you on weekends.\r\nSpongeBob: I've got diarrhea!  Huh? Are you Flats' dad?\r\nFlats' Dad: Why, yes I am.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt.\r\nFlats: Dad, what're you doing?\r\nFlats' Dad: Uhh, nothing son.\r\nFlats: What did I tell you about talking to strangers?\r\nFlats' Dad: Now he's going to kick my butt!\r\nSpongeBob: Out of my way!

Well we'll show you, old man!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! \"BobPants SpongeSquare\". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after.\r\nFlats: Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey Flats, you feeling better?\r\nFlats: What? Where am I?\r\nPurple Doctorfish: Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure.\r\nFlats: Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt.  Those flowers for me?\r\nSpongeBob: He's still gonna kick my butt!\r\nHarold: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man!?\r\nLonnie: I love the young people!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!  Hang on, I'll transfer your call.  Who is it?

I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly.\r\nFlats: Are you ready?\r\nSpongeBob: Hold on.  Okay, I'm ready.  I said I'm ready.  Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready.  That tickles.  Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you known what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow!  Flats, are you okay?  Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call...  ...'violence road'.\r\nMrs. Puff: Sorry I'm late, class, I...  SpongeBob!

I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.\r\nSpongeBob: He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!\r\nMr. Krabs: Do you know what this means, dear boy?

Oh. Yeah.  He's a real cut-up, that one. He knows how to keep the crew in stitches. Good one, boy! Always on, that one. There's no off on his funny switch.  Oh, ah, oh stop it. Oh, you're, you're killin' me.  Oh! Look, I almost forgot! It's open cash register night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register!\r\nOfficer Malley: 86 those patties, Krabs.

Well, goodbye now.\r\nOfficer Nancy: Hey, there's no ice.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want, you want ice? Is that what you want?\r\nSpongeBob: The dark deed you requested is done, sir.\r\nOfficer Nancy: I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, ri...?\r\nMr. Krabs: There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth!\r\nOfficer Nancy: Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder!\r\nMr. Krabs: Okay! I confess!  SpongeBob killed him!\r\nSpongeBob: What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!\r\nMr. Krabs: He was insane, out of control. He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.\r\nSpongeBob: It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.\r\nMr. Krabs: Put him down now, he's a mad dog!\r\nSpongeBob: He wears curlers to bed!\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait! It's not what you think!\r\nOfficer Nancy: What are you two talking about?\r\nMr. Krabs: We killed the health inspector, buried him, and then stuffed his body in the freezer.\r\nOfficer Nancy: You mean in here?\r\nMr. Krabs: It's empty?\r\nOfficer Nancy: Is this some kind of a joke?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah...a joke!\r\nOfficer Nancy: Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out.\r\nSpongeBob: It's the zombie!\r\nHealth Inspector: You guys should...\r\nOfficer Malley: Take that, you zombie!\r\nOfficer Nancy: I'll take it from here.  Die, zombie!\r\nOfficer Malley: Good police work, officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.\r\nHealth Inspector: Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!\r\nEveryone: Hooray!\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really.\r\nHealth Inspector: Oh, boy, I'd like a Krabby Patty.\r\nNarrator: Well, that's the story.

Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?\r\nSpongeBob: Pretty smart, huh?\r\nPatrick: I thought it wouldn't work.\r\nSquidward: Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there.

These are my people!  And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou...  ...uranium! In the water supply.  See? Crystal clear!

Get away!\r\nGuard #1: What are you talking about, Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili.\r\nGuard #1: Let's face it, Puff, you've gone off the deep end.  Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement!\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room.\r\nSpongeBob: Made of sponge!  I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test!\r\nOfficer Malley: Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk.\r\nMrs. Puff: No!

I'm not a criminal!\r\nMrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail!\r\nOfficer Malley: Why would you go to jail? You already did your time.\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, it's just my imagination again.\r\nDonna: So what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama? Chili?\r\nMrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh?

Down here, I am perfectly...\r\nSpongeBob: Exposed.\r\nSquidward: Would you two please...  ...stop throwing...  ...snowballs?!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward returned fire!\r\nPatrick: Then it's war!\r\nSquidward: No-no... no, wait, wait, wait!

Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it.\r\nMr. Krabs: There you are, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, pilot.\r\nMr. Krabs: I need you to...  ...OW!  Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful.\r\nDale: Hey, were you able to catch Glenn the Pinkfish on Flounderman last night?\r\nLou: No. How was he?\r\nDale: Well, I knew that this guy's acting was good, but his singing was phenomenal. I'm telling you, Vendor, if that guy was to cut a solo record, he'd be a hit.\r\nSpongeBob: Solo record!\r\nMr. Krabs: So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and...  ...eh, come in.  Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful.\r\nSpongeBob: They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby.\r\nMr. Krabs: The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.\r\nMr. Krabs: What in blazes are you talking about?\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we?\r\nMr. Krabs: Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.\r\nSpongeBob: I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm out of here.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oooooh... I've never felt such a strange combination of pity... and indigestion.\r\nBill: There he is! Hey! We've been waiting for you.\r\nNazz: Where have you been?\r\nBill: How long are you going to keep us standing here?\r\nSquidward: Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?\r\nSpongeBob: Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.\r\nSquidward: I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us.  On second thought, keep 'em waiting.\r\nSpongeBob: No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment.\r\nSquidward: Enter-what?\r\nSpongeBob: How you doing, folks?\r\nAll: Hungry!\r\nSpongeBob: That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy.\r\nSquidward: Hey!\r\nBill: Eating here was your idea.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd like to call this little number \"Striped Sweater.\" ♪The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind  'Cause when you're wearing...♪\r\nBill: We're starving!\r\nSpongeBob: ♪That one... special... sweater...♪  Squidward, this crowd is insatiable.\r\nSquidward: Then why don't you back in the kitchen, and grab some patties, and give them what they  came here for?!\r\nSpongeBob: Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy.\r\nNancy: Is this some kind of joke?\r\nSpongeBob: They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd.\r\nBill: Oh, now what's he doing?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!\r\nBill: We're losing our appetites!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.\r\nAll: We want patties!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa!\r\nAll: Boo!\r\nSpongeBob: No!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted.\r\nBill: Hey! Finally!\r\nNancy: That's what we've been waiting for.\r\nSpongeBob: They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks.\r\nAll: Yay!\r\nSpongeBob: You like that?\r\nBill: It's what we wanted all along.\r\nSpongeBob: It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns!  It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this?\r\nAll: Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.\r\nCustomers: We want onions! Cheese! Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: Ready for the grand finale?\r\nAll: Whoopee! Krabby Patties!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.\r\nSpongeBob: I'll say.

I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test!\r\nSquidward: You're saying something!\r\nMr. Krabs: Heavens to Betsy, no.

Two, you stole it. Or three—you stole it!\r\nSquidward: I didn't take your precious dime!\r\nMr. Krabs: Show me your tentacles.\r\nSquidward: What?!\r\nMr. Krabs: I wanna see empty suction cups.\r\nSquidward: Here!

The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab!\r\nSpongeBob: But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles?\r\nSquidward: Being dead or anything else!\r\nSpongeBob: I never knew you felt so strongly about it.\r\nSquidward: Where have you been?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there.

I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me...  ...we're like brothers, only closer.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to.  I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman.\r\nSpongeBob: Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache.\r\nSquidward: Yeah...uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... Goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands!

I own a five-star restaurant!\r\nSquilliam: Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success.\r\nSquidward: That's right.\r\nSquilliam: And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight.\r\nSquidward: T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?\r\nSquilliam: In fact, we'll all come. My treat!\r\nSquidward: Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, boo-hoo! Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin.\r\nSquidward: This is serious.\r\nMr. Krabs: I know. This really is the world's smallest violin.  See?\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.\r\nMr. Krabs: Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam?  That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?\r\nSquidward: Don't rub it in.\r\nMr. Krabs: Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.\r\nSquidward: Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible.  Patrick, what are you doing here?\r\nPatrick: I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!\r\nSquidward: The Corps? What the... Pat, this isn't the... oh!  Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?\r\nPatrick: You mean like a weenie? Okay!  May I take your hat, sir? May I take your hat, sir? May I...\r\nSquidward: Alright, I've heard enough. You've got the job.  Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?\r\nMr. Krabs: Aye-aye!\r\nSquidward: Then you'll be our chef.\r\nSpongeBob: What can I do?\r\nSquidward: I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.\r\nSpongeBob: What's that?\r\nSquidward: It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.\r\nSpongeBob: Do other restaurants do that?\r\nSquidward: Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this.\r\nSpongeBob: \"How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes.\" Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!\r\nSquidward: Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!\r\nPatrick: Gimme that hat!  I said give it to me! Are you gonna hand it over or not? Don't you back-sass me!\r\nSquidward: He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential!  What happened? What is it?\r\nMr. Krabs: Peas!  Made 'em the old-fashioned way.\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the...  Holy fish paste, what is that?!\r\nMr. Krabs: That's the appetizer.\r\nSquidward: But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?\r\nMr. Krabs: Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea.\r\nSquidward: There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me!  Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Every sentence, every paragraph...  Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?!  My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax.  Little more.  Little more.  Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.\r\nSpongeBob: Empty my mind?\r\nSquidward: Empty your mind.\r\nSpongeBob: Empty my mind...\r\nSquidward: Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing.\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #1: Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!\r\nOther Smaller SpongeBobs: Everything?\r\nSpongeBob #1: Everything!  Come on, come on, come on! Bring 'em, bring 'em, bring 'em! Jellies, jellies!  Let's go, let's go! Keep doing it!  Come on, let's get moving!  Hurry up! What do you think I'm paying you for?\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #2: You don't pay me. We don't even exist. We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought.\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #1: One more crack like that and you're out of here!\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #2: No, please! I have three kids!\r\nSquidward: How do you feel?  SpongeBob?  This isn't working! I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time!  I'll just go to Squilliam's house and...  Squilliam, you're here!\r\nSquilliam: Hello, Squiddy!  We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.\r\nSquidward: Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!\r\nSquilliam: Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school,  are trying to pass off a lousy burger stand as a five-star...  ...restaurant!?  Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina...\r\nSpongeBob: Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately!\r\nSquidward: How did you do all this?\r\nSpongeBob: It was easy, once I cleared my mind.\r\nSquidward: But what about Krabs and Patrick?\r\nSpongeBob: Taken care of.  Right this way, please.  Good evening, sir.  From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg?  We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank.\r\nSquilliam: Mmm... this is fantastic!\r\nSpongeBob: Thank you, sir.\r\nSquidward: Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Ow!\r\nSpongeBob: If you need anything else, just call.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!\r\nSpongeBob: Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do.\r\nSquidward: It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face.  Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.\r\nSquilliam: Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!\r\nSquidward: In that case, I need you to read this.\r\nSquilliam: Uhh, \"Squidward Tentacles...\"\r\nSquidward: And I need you to wear this.\r\nSquilliam: Oh, eh, \"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest...\"\r\nSquidward: I'm sorry, one more time.\r\nSquilliam: \"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs.\"  Squidward, I must tell you...  Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name.\r\nSpongeBob: My name?\r\nSquilliam: Yes, your name, son.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh... Beef Wellington?\r\nSquilliam: No, your name.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh... err... the fork on the left?\r\nSquidward: Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.\r\nSpongeBob: My name?\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #3: What's his name?! What's his name?! I've got nothing on a name!\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #4: Come on, baby, what's the name?!?\r\nSmaller SpongeBob #5: We threw out his name!\r\nSquidward: I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that...\r\nSpongeBob: More soup for your armpit?\r\nSpongeBob: Please enjoy the food!  Would you like some cheese on that, sir?\r\nSquidward: No! Nooo!\r\nMr. Krabs: Run for your lives, everyone! It's the appetizer!\r\nSquilliam: Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.\r\nSquidward: Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!\r\nSquilliam: Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too!\r\nSquidward: Is that true?\r\nSquilliam: Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my balloon/casino!\r\nSpongeBob: Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?\r\nSquidward: Oh, the usual.  Would you get out of here!?\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`49a\r\nKrab Borg\r\nTV: We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.\r\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh?\r\nMr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to?\r\nRadio DJ: And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: \"Electric Zoo.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music.\r\nSpongeBob: I surrender! Oh.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?\r\nSquidward: I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order!\r\nSpongeBob: #17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?\r\nSquidward: Hilarious. Just deliver the food.\r\nSpongeBob: There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?\r\nThaddeus: No, I'm not.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!\r\nMr. Krabs: I feel completely recharged!\r\nSpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me.\r\nSpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels \"recharged.\"  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot! Nah.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.\r\nRadio DJ: Hmmm... which one, man?\r\nMr. Krabs: The one that goes \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.\"\r\nRadio DJ: No, man. You're thinking of \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?!  Boo-boo-bop?!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!\r\nSquidward: That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.\r\nSquidward: How did you...?\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: What is it, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.\r\nMr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?\r\nSquidward: Umm... yeah, sure.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?\r\nMr. Krabs: Why?\r\nSquidward: It was rated \"Arr!\" Arr! Because it's... about... pirates.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!\r\nSpongeBob: Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot!\r\nSquidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: What? What is it, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!\r\nSpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!\r\nSpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love.\r\nSquidward: No, wait, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: What is it, SpongeBob?!\r\nSpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\r\nMr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died!  Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas.  Me hard-boiled egg is ready!  I can already taste it. Come to Papa.  Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ahhh! Oh, my eyes!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr...\r\nSquidward: Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.\r\nSquidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?!\r\nSquidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!\r\nOperator: Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!\r\nSquidward: Not the Navy!  Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world!  Our world!  What do we do now?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know!  Hey, a nickel!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ah, that's better.  Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.\r\nSquidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.\r\nSquidward: They poop on the robot?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.\r\nSquidward: I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!\r\nSquidward: Shut up!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!\r\nSquidward: I said \"shut up!,\" you bucket of bolts!\r\nSpongeBob: I can't take it!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, are you okay?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!\r\nSquidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah.\r\nSquidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.\r\nSpongeBob: Right.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs.\r\nSquidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.\r\nSquidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!\r\nSpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot.\r\nMr. Krabs: What?!  You think I'm a robot?!\r\nSquidward: We don't think; we know.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!\r\nSquidward: He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.\r\nSpongeBob: I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his \"little buddy.\"\r\nSquidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.\r\nMr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.\r\nSquidward: We're just gonna see what your \"little buddy\" knows.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!\r\nSquidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh?\r\nMr. Krabs: No! That cost me $24.95!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything.\r\nSquidward: Go get the toaster.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  Nooo!\r\nSpongeBob: This is the last robot, Squidward.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No!\r\nSquidward: I thought you said robots can't cry.\r\nSpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love.\r\nMr. Krabs: I loved it like it was me own.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?\r\nSpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their...  imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary.\r\nMr. Krabs: Squidward!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`49b\r\nRock-a-Bye Bivalve\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy.

Well, I'd better get going.\r\nPatrick: Yep, see you later.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: What did you say?\r\nPatrick: Well, I didn't say anything.\r\nSpongeBob: I didn't say anything, either.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: See you later then.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.\r\nPatrick: Ah, but it is you  that is messing with me.  That's what's messing with us.\r\nSpongeBob: It's a baby scallop.\r\nPatrick: I'll take care of this!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet.\r\nPatrick: What's the matter, is he stupid?\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him.\r\nPatrick: Well, we can't just leave him out here.\r\nSpongeBob: You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat  in the house.\r\nPatrick: Let me see!  Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh!  I think somebody's hungry!\r\nSpongeBob: Is it true? Are you hungry?\r\nJunior: Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!\r\nSpongeBob: I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty?\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!\r\nSpongeBob: Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty.\r\nJunior: Blech!\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?

Look at the funny face!\r\nPatrick: Wait. I think I might know the problem.  Yep, that's it, alright.  Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new.\r\nSpongeBob: How did you know?\r\nPatrick: How do you think?  And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.\r\nPatrick: I know, good thing there's two of us.\r\nSpongeBob: You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.\r\nPatrick: Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.\r\nPatrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., ...this would be kind of shocking.  Just call me Daddy!\r\nPatrick: It sure is cute when it's asleep.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.  Shh!\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.\r\nSpongeBob: Me neither.\r\nPatrick: Well, good night, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.  Patrick, breakfast is ready.\r\nPatrick: Alright. All this parenting stuff makes me hungry.  Hey, Junior, how are you doing today?  SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Kid's got a stinky.\r\nSpongeBob: Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full.\r\nPatrick: Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.\r\nSpongeBob: Going? Where are you going?\r\nPatrick: I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?\r\nSpongeBob: You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?\r\nPatrick: I'll give you a break tonight when I get home.

We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.\r\nPatrick: I changed his diaper!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, once.\r\nPatrick: He's only this big.  How many diapers could he possibly use?\r\nSpongeBob: Hmmm?\r\nPatrick: Oh, that's not so much.\r\nSpongeBob: Hmmm?\r\nPatrick: So?\r\nSpongeBob: Hmmm?  Hmmm?  Hmmm!?\r\nPatrick: I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh!  I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise.\r\nSpongeBob: So, what's the plan for the day?\r\nPatrick: No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.\r\nSpongeBob: Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.\r\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\r\nSpongeBob: Six o'clock.\r\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\r\nSpongeBob: Six o'clock.\r\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\r\nSpongeBob: Six o'clock.\r\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\r\nNarrator: 12:00 midnight.\r\nPatrick: Oh, that was some party.  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior.  What? What?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, nothing.\r\nPatrick: Oh, what a relief.  For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.\r\nSpongeBob: Do you remember what you said to me this morning?\r\nPatrick: Somethin' about root beer, right?\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nPatrick: Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.\r\nSpongeBob: Does...  \"You can take the night off, pal!\"  ...ring a bell?\r\nPatrick: I don't need this.\r\nSpongeBob: What?!  Where do you think you're going?\r\nPatrick: I'm going back to work.\r\nSpongeBob: Work?!\r\nPatrick: He got hit in the head with two coconuts!\r\nSpongeBob: So, this is work?\r\nPatrick: You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote,  and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase!\r\nPatrick: Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?\r\nSpongeBob: Overtime?!\r\nPatrick: Yeah, overtime, pal.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!\r\nPatrick: You know what that means?\r\nSpongeBob: And that's the kind of work you're doing?\r\nPatrick: ​It means working when you're just too tired to work!\r\nSpongeBob: Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!\r\nPatrick: You just keep going on working and working!\r\nSpongeBob: ​You never help!  Never!\r\nPatrick: There's that stupid noise again!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.\r\nPatrick: Oh.\r\nBoth: Junior!\r\nSpongeBob: Did you catch him?\r\nPatrick: No.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're bad parents!\r\nSpongeBob: Junior? Hey, he's flying.\r\nPatrick: I guess he's all grown up.  Hey, what about Daddy?  That's my boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Goodbye.\r\nPatrick: Goodbye, Junior.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.\r\nPatrick: This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.\r\nSpongeBob: Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.\r\nPatrick: Yeah...

Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become...\r\nPatrick: A one-way ticket to pain!\r\nMr. Krabs: Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Heave-ho!\r\nMr. Krabs: What the devil fish is going on out here?!  Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money!  And that's just sick!\r\nSpongeBob: But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.\r\nMr. Krabs: What stupid barnacle told you that?\r\nSquidward: Uhh…\r\nMr. Krabs: Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me.  Now, are you men ready for your Super...?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Super?\r\nMr. Krabs: Special...?\r\nBoth: Special?\r\nMr. Krabs: Secret...?\r\nBoth: Secret?\r\nMr. Krabs: Assignment?\r\nBoth: Assignment?!? / I beg of you, Mr. Krabs! / Put us out of our misery!\r\nMr. Krabs: The two of you are to paint the inside of me house!\r\nBoth: Yay!\r\nMr. Krabs: But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  …and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?\r\nPatrick: No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.\r\nPatrick: Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.\r\nPatrick: Good, just don't pay me.\r\nSpongeBob: First, we need to set up the tarp.\r\nPatrick: Tarp ahoy!\r\nSpongeBob: We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.\r\nPatrick: That will never ever come off.\r\nSpongeBob: And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.\r\nPatrick: And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  Careful, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, the lid's already off.\r\nPatrick: Oh. Now it's my turn!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Well, that was a rip-off.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.\r\nNarrator: One hour later...\r\nSpongeBob: Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.\r\nNarrator: Two hours later...\r\nSpongeBob: I'm getting to the painting.\r\nNarrator: Three hours later...\r\nPatrick: Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.\r\nSpongeBob: No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?!  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!\r\nPatrick: Oh, I know!  Two giant paint bubbles!\r\nSpongeBob: Noooooo!  Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!\r\nPatrick: Nonsense!\r\nSpongeBob: Pat, no!  We did it!  We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--  Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?\r\nPatrick: Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!\r\nSpongeBob: That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!\r\nPatrick: I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it.\r\nPatrick: Oh, now I see it!\r\nSpongeBob: This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar…\r\nPatrick: Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!\r\nSpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said…\r\nPatrick: Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something!\r\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\r\nPatrick: Nope.\r\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\r\nPatrick: Nope.\r\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\r\nPatrick: Nope.  Oof! Oof! Oof!\r\nSpongeBob: Nothing's working!\r\nPatrick: Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen!  We have technology!\r\nSpongeBob: It didn't work.\r\nPatrick: This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...\r\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.\r\nPatrick: I don't see where you're going with this...  hey, a dollar!\r\nSpongeBob: Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  No…why'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!\r\nPatrick: Wanna bite?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!\r\nSpongeBob's reflection: You're on your own, pal.\r\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!\r\nMr. Krabs: What the…?\r\nSpongeBob: We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you.\r\nMr. Krabs: You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going...\r\nMr. Krabs: Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!\r\nPatrick: Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?\r\nSpongeBob: It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!\r\nPatrick: We didn't do it on purpose!\r\nBoth: Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!\r\nPatrick: I don't want to be butt-less!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned!\r\nDoll: Mama.\r\nMr. Krabs: And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go.  Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, you know, just hanging around.\r\nPatrick: Boo!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly.\r\nSpongeBob: No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!\r\nMr. Krabs: Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?!\r\nSpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!\r\nPatrick: We're so sorry!\r\nMr. Krabs: And then did you draw on it with crayon?!\r\nPatrick: I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, boys... you know what I've gotta do now?!\r\nSpongeBob: You mean our butts?\r\nPatrick: Can I use mine one last time?\r\nMr. Krabs: There we go, good as new.\r\nBoth: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!\r\nMr. Krabs: Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud.

If you're watching this video, then let me be the first to say: Congratulations!  You've recently been hired in the Krusty Krab  and this is your first official day of training.\r\nSpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now?\r\nNarrator: Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph...  Graph!  You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't get that way over night...  ...because the store closes at 6:00.  No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat.  But mostly his sweat.  From Humble Beginnings.  You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today.  And you're right!  After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless.  But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born.  Sounds like a lot of...\r\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!\r\nNarrator: Sounds like a lot of...\r\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!\r\nNarrator: Sounds like a...\r\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!  Hoopla!\r\nNarrator: Sounds like a lot of hoopla to make over a little Krabby Patty, right?  Wrong!  The Krusty Krab today.  To keep up with today's demanding customers, no expense has been spared to acquire all the latest achievements in fast-food technology.\r\nMr. Krabs: This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism.  Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch!  These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported.  This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine.  And most importantly,  You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.\r\nNarrator: All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it?  Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check.  But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder.  Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, \"Hello world! May I take your order?\" You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants! But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good.  Let's see, inattentive, impatient, a glazed look in the eyes.  Look carefully at the \"I Really Wish I Weren't Here Right Now!\" button. There's a name for employees like this, but we'll call him Squidward.\r\nSquidward: I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Sorry, can't hear you!\r\nNarrator: Training.\r\nSpongeBob: Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?\r\nNarrator: No, you can't make a Krabby Patty without understanding the phrase POOP.\r\nSpongeBob: POOP?\r\nNarrator: Once you understand POOP, you'll understand your place at the Krusty Krab. But what does POOP mean?  It's actually a carefully organized code. Watch closely. People Order Our Patties.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, POOP!\r\nNarrator: Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP.  Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.\r\nHarold: I'd like to order-\r\nNarrator: Do you think he's going to order: A: A sofa, B: An expensive haircut, or C: A patty?\r\nHarold: One patty please.\r\nNarrator: Ah, POOP! You never let us down!  Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.\r\nSpongeBob: Krabby Patty!\r\nNarrator: Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about: Personal Hygiene.  Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines.  Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift?  A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails.  And don't forget about the knuckles.  And make sure those palms are squeaky clean.  All right, let's see those hands.  Now that's thorough!  After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils,  and your hair is neat and tidy,  you are ready to start the day. Now let's see how Squidward prepares for his shift.  Remember, no employee wants to be a Squidward!  Now that you're clean and hygienic, I bet you think you're ready to make that Krabby Patty.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!  I'm ready!  I'm ready!\r\nNarrator: Whoa there! We have a few more topics to cover first.  Your Work Station.  It's important to keep your area tidy and free of droppings. But a clean workstation is only part of the job.  To make the vision in your head a reality, you'll need supplies. And a good employee always keeps his supplies well-organized.  Very nice, Mr. SquarePants, not a pickle out of place.  Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station.\r\nSquidward: Huh?  Oh!\r\nNarrator: Don't worry, Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you.  Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty.  Calm down.  There's plenty of time left. We have to make sure you're ready for the psychological aspect of the job: Interfacing with your Boss.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?\r\nMr. Krabs: No.\r\nNarrator: Good job, Mr. SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now-\r\nNarrator: Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer. Or as we like to say, the \"Krustomer\"!\r\nPatrick: Who said that? Are you a ghost?\r\nNarrator: Like precious, precious blood in an animal, the customer is what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive.\r\nPatrick: Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!\r\nSquidward: Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?\r\nPatrick: Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah...  Huh? What's that?\r\nSquidward: Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.\r\nNarrator: Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr. Krabs says.\r\nMr. Krabs: The money is always right!\r\nPatrick: The ceiling is right, Squidward. You're not a very good employee.\r\nSquidward: Fine. May I please take your order?\r\nPatrick: I'll have uhh... uhhhh...\r\nNarrator: We'll check up on these two later.  Right now, it's important that we discuss an emergency situation!  Like the lost gold of Atlantis, many consider the Krabby Patty to be a treasure. And as with every treasure, there's a thief ready to steal it. So it's up to you to be the watchful eyes of...  What's this?  It's Mr. Krabs business rival, Plankton!\r\nPlankton: Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine!\r\nNarrator: He's stealing the formula! What are you going to do, Mr. SquarePants?\r\nPlankton: You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into maximum overdrive!  Hi-ya!  I knew I should've gotten the turbo.  Hear me, Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead...\r\nNarrator: And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr. SquarePants.  Let's check in on Squidward again. Psst, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Huh?\r\nNarrator: Just remember POOP.\r\nSquidward: Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?\r\nPatrick: Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.\r\nSquidward: Will that be for here or to go?\r\nNarrator: Hang in there, Squidward, it's all part of the job.  Now that you've learned the basics of your training, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for.\r\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da-daa,\r\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-daa Da-da-da-la-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da-daa,\r\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, tssshh Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa-da-da a-da-daa,\r\nTi-ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ta-ta- la-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba- ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba-baa, Ti-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-taa,\r\nTi-ta-ti-li (gasps, then resumes)\r\nTi-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li- ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-ta-ti-ti- ta-ti-ti-taaaaa\r\nNarrator: Preparing the Krabby Patty!

Well, might as well throw these in the fire.\r\nPatchy: Ah, well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid.

Oh yeah, SquarePants. Well, I guess it's time to move again.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, Gary, this \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" is a real life-saver.  How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream.  Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world!  My piñata!  Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.  The \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" suggests creativity when stuffing your piñata, so I'm using deviled eggs.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Good question Gary, but not to worry. The \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule!  8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution.  At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades.  9:38: charity apple-bob.  9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice.

Welcome, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't mind if I do!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests!\r\nPatrick: Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, you dumb bunny, it says, \"Hello, my name is Patrick.\"\r\nPatrick: Nice to meet you Patrick.\r\nMr. Krabs: Good one, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Was he talking to me or you?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you made it!\r\nSquidward: My cable's out.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that.\r\nMr Krabs: So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Not bad.\r\nSpongeBob: I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47.  But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter.  Here are some topic cards to break the ice.  Oh, someone's at the door!\r\nScooter: Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!\r\nSquidward: This is lame.\r\nUnnamed Character: My card says, \"Discuss the philosophical nature of irony.\" What does yours say?\r\nPatrick: \"Nod politely.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: What does yours say, Plankton?\r\nPlankton: Oh, uh, it says,  'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.'  How interesting.\r\nMr. Krabs: Nice try, Plankton.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive...  22 minutes late!\r\nTom: Hey, hey!\r\nSpongeBob: Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position!  As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me!  Seriously.\r\nNarrator: (television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages.   Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Gare, got another coat for you.  The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to  work.  Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here?  This is all wrong! What's happening to my party?  No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm!  Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52!  Hey, what's this?\r\nSandals: That's my breakfast!\r\nSpongeBob: Could I have everyone's attention please?  Patrick!  If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks.  Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means!  Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this!  This is yesterday's paper.  I'll just go grab today's paper.  SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you?  Locked out?\r\nSandy: This song's got a great beat.\r\nPatrick: Yeah. Knock, knock.\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it.\r\nPatrick: So, do you come here often?\r\nMrs. Puff: No.\r\nPatrick: Hello, SquarePants residence. What?  I'm sorry, what?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: You wanna talk to SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!\r\nPatrick: Okay, hold on.  SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!\r\nSpongeBob: What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait!\r\nPatrick: Sorry, he's not out there.\r\nScooter: Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.\r\nPatrick: Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule!\r\nLarry: Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat!  Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind.  Hey, check out his crazy comb.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet.  I hope they don't touch my special comb.\r\nLarry: Well, I think I've aired it up enough.  Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.\r\nSpongeBob: I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events!\r\nPearl: Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely.  Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in!  Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned.  I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but...  ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in!\r\nOfficer John: Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?\r\nOfficer O'Malley: I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.\r\nOfficer John: You criminals make me sick.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!\r\nOfficer John: Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!\r\nOfficer O'Malley: You have a nice party now, sir.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.\r\nOfficer John: Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?\r\nSpongeBob: But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.\r\nOfficer O'Malley: Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge.  Oh no, these cuffs are broken.\r\nOfficer John: Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.\r\nSpongeBob: Is it too late to offer you some punch?\r\nOfficer O'Malley: Sir, you have the right to remain silent.\r\nSpongeBob: All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit!  Oh, yeah, the door's locked.  Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr!  Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster.\r\nPatrick: That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!\r\nSpongeBob: It was?\r\nPatrick: Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!\r\nSpongeBob: I am?\r\nPatrick: Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya!\r\nSpongeBob: SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all.  Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Good night, Gary.\r\nPatchy: Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going!

Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later.\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.\r\nPatrick: Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?\r\nPatrick: Wait for you to get back.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?\r\nPatrick: Hey, that's a great idea!\r\nSpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!\r\nPatrick: Wow.\r\nSpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime.\r\nPatrick: And no line.\r\nSpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning.  And this is the Fountain Of Learning.  And these are the Lockers Of Learning.\r\nPatrick: And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?\r\nSpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning.\r\nPatrick: Where is everyone?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.\r\nPatrick: 6:20? But I thought you said you were late.\r\nSpongeBob: Late for being early.\r\nPatrick: Hey!  When did I start wearing a watch?\r\nSpongeBob: And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.\r\nPatrick: Ohh.\r\nSpongeBob: And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.\r\nPatrick: Ohhh.\r\nSpongeBob: And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.\r\nPatrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!\r\nSpongeBob: Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too.  There you are.\r\nPatrick: But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74.\r\nPatrick: Who said that?  Was it him?\r\nSpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.\r\nPatrick: What does he teach us?\r\nSpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.\r\nPatrick: Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Sorry.\r\nSpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?\r\nPatrick: I'm learning!\r\nSpongeBob: This is gonna be great!\r\nMrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?\r\nPatrick: Who's the fat kid talking to?\r\nSpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher.\r\nPatrick: Oh.\r\nMrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous.\r\nPatrick: Uh...uh...\r\nMrs. Puff: We just want to know your name.\r\nPatrick: Uh...uh...uh!...24!\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, great, another genius...\r\nPatrick: Why are they laughing?\r\nSpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing.\r\nPatrick: Oh.\r\nMrs. Puff: Today's first lesson will be on turning.\r\nPatrick: 24.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: What?\r\nSpongeBob: I thought of something funnier than 24.\r\nPatrick: Let me hear it.\r\nSpongeBob: 25.\r\nMrs. Puff: That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.\r\nMrs. Puff: Now then, \"Turning\"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least...\r\nSpongeBob: Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!\r\nMrs. Puff: What about the teacher?  As if I really look like this!  SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions.\r\nSpongeBob: No...\r\nMrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!\r\nMrs. Puff: You'll get this star back when you earn it...\r\nSpongeBob: No!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\r\nPatrick: Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?\r\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!\r\nSpongeBob: What, me? But why?\r\nMrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks a lot, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Sure thing, buddy.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?\r\nPatrick: Psst, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Just ignore him, SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, over here.\r\nSpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him.\r\nPatrick: Psst, SpongeBob.  Psst, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSpongeBob: HI?!\r\nMrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess.\r\nPatrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.\r\nSpongeBob: There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!\r\nPatrick: Who cares about a stupid star?\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!\r\nPatrick: I'll deal with you after class!\r\nSpongeBob: It is after class!\r\nPatrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you?\r\nSpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting!\r\nPatrick: Well, don't mind if I do!\r\nStudent: This is embarrassing.\r\nMrs. Puff: What's going on here?!  Well?\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting.\r\nMrs. Puff: Fighting?  Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend  to detention!\r\nSpongeBob: Detention!?\r\nMrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your souls.\r\nSpongeBob: In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.

That's how much I hate you.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out.  Huh?\r\nPatrick: Ohh...  Hmph.\r\nPatrick: Ohhhhh...!\r\nSpongeBob: Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!\r\nPatrick: I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry your apology is so long!\r\nPatrick: Me too! Let's save Roger!\r\nSpongeBob: I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet.\r\nPatrick: Ahh. Light bulb!  But why does it have to be so far away?  I'm coming, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth.  The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!\r\nPatrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm!\r\nSpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!\r\nMrs. Puff: Good job boys!  I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star.

Look what we've got!\r\nMr. Krabs: Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, it's Coral Blue number-  three.\r\nMr. Krabs: I trusted you, and you gave me this? I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this.\r\nSquidward: No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.\r\nMr. Krabs: I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.\r\nSquidward: You're kidding?\r\nSpongeBob: Woo! Is it another fishing trip?\r\nMr. Krabs: No. It's this sandwich.\r\nSquidward: A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?\r\nMr. Krabs: Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.\r\nSquidward: Whatever. We've got plenty more to...  ...eat.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back.\r\nSquidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you?

How do we get out of here?\r\nSquidward: If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nMr. Krabs: So, you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. \"It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice.\"  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you: live bait!\r\nSquidward: You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, he'll come.\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  you are completely out of your mind!  Get us out of here!\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!

With your host, Patchy the Pirate!\r\nPatchy: Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, \"Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave?\" Good question, you little…  Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times  …back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding you now.  It's stuck.  Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  It was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures.  Your clothes always match.  You can draw on the walls. And nobody yell at ya.  It was much easier to hit a baseball.  Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  Hey kids. Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is. Please welcome the Potty-dactyl\r\nPotty: Sorry I'm late.\r\nPatchy: Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume?

Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.\r\nSpongeBob: Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.\r\nSquidward: Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob.  I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.\r\nPatrick: Wow, a snail made out of bread.\r\nSquidward: No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See?  She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.\r\nSpongeBob: Training?\r\nSquidward: For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.\r\nPatrick: Sunday?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!\r\nSquidward: No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?\r\nSquidward: Papers.\r\nPatrick: Hmmm. 'Property of Squidward... Tentpoles.'\r\nSquidward: That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie.\r\nSpongeBob: You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.\r\nPatrick: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward!\r\nSpongeBob: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use.\r\nSandy: Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow.\r\nSpongeBob: Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're cliché.  And nails for toughness.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time.\r\nPatrick: Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, your snail is a rock.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race.\r\nSpongeBob: Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.\r\nSquidward: Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.\r\nPatrick: Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail.\r\nSquidward: Patrick, that's a rock.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.\r\nSquidward: What are you standing on, anyway?  Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow.\r\nPatrick: My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do.\r\nPatrick: You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...

And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.\r\nPerch Perkins: Hey, what are you doing?!  Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony.\r\nMayor: And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano!\r\nPerch Perkins: Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts...  ...for Larry.  He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.\r\nNarrator: Two hours later...\r\nPerch Perkins: He's almost a quarter of the way there.\r\nMayor: The torch is lit! Let the race begin.\r\nSquidward: Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations.\r\nSpongeBob: Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life.\r\nSquidward: I'll alert the paramedics.\r\nPatrick: Good one, Squidward.\r\nOfficial: You guys ready?\r\nPatrick: A burglar!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's the official.\r\nOfficial: We're ready to start here, folks.\r\nSquidward: Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.\r\nSnellie: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nPatrick: This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here.\r\nOfficial: On your mark. Get set.  Slither!\r\nPerch Perkins: And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!\r\nSpongeBob: What!\r\nSquidward: Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!\r\nSpongeBob: What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!\r\nPatrick: It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!\r\nPerch Perkins: And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.\r\nSpongeBob: Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!\r\nPerch Perkins: I do not like the look of this.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!\r\nPerch Perkins: That coach is pushing that snail too hard!\r\nSpongeBob: Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?\r\nPerch Perkins: Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout!  Oops, make that two, folks.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Gary?\r\nPerch Perkins: Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.\r\nSpongeBob: Umm, Gary, you can stop now!\r\nPerch Perkins: He's losing control!\r\nSpongeBob: You can take a break now if you want to, Gary.\r\nPerch Perkins: He's spinning out of control!  He's heading straight for the wall!\r\nSpongeBob: No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!\r\nPerch Perkins: Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen.\r\nSquidward: Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!\r\nSnellie: Meow.\r\nSquidward: What?!\r\nSpongeBob: Gary?  Oh!\r\nCrowd: Aww!\r\nPerch Perkins: My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary.\r\nSpongeBob: Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then...\r\nAnnouncer: And the winner is Rocky!\r\nSquidward: I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock.\r\nPatrick: Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.\r\nSquidward: Gosh, Patrick, thanks.

I could use these.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, boys!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?\r\nSquidward: Well, it was.\r\nMr. Krabs: You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?\r\nTimmy: A Krabby Patty.\r\nMr. Krabs: Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?\r\nTimmy: I don't go hungry?\r\nMr. Krabs: No, silly! It means free toy!\r\nTimmy: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.\r\nMr. Krabs: I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'.\r\nMr. Krabs: Great!\r\nMartha: Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.\r\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy?\r\nSquidward: Eugene, my man.\r\nMr. Krabs: Squidward! How's the break coming?\r\nSquidward: Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you?\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?\r\nHarold: This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!\r\nMr. Krabs: No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.\r\nSquidward: Here's your mail, Eugene.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.\r\nSquidward: Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me.\r\nMr. Krabs: Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And... there's no money in here.  How delightful.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.\r\nSquidward: Me, too. How are we gonna get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon.\r\nSquidward: Uh... \"dream\"?\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!Uh\r\nSpongeBob: Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.\r\nSquidward: Here's the bill.\r\nMr. Krabs: You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate!\r\nNathiel Waters: Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny!\r\nMr. Krabs: Your luck just ran out!\r\nNathiel Waters: Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.\r\nMr. Krabs: Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off.\r\nFlying Dutchman: A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm not cheap, I'm generous!\r\nSquidward: You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait just a burger-flipping second!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?\r\nSpongeBob: That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea.\r\nFlying Dutchman: He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.\r\nFlying Dutchman: You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?\r\nMr. Krabs: That depends, how much money we talking about?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nFlying Dutchman: 62 cents.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'll take the money.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents.  Next stop: Davy Jones' locker!\r\nMr. Krabs: Look, Squidward, money!\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?\r\nMr. Krabs: You think I could've gotten more?\r\nSquidward: He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money!  I want SpongeBob back!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Here, take him back.\r\nMr. Krabs: You heard what I said about the money?\r\nFlying Dutchman: Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds.  And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!\r\nSpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!\r\nFlying Dutchman: He's your problem now.\r\nMr. Krabs: Heh, about trading you for pocket change...\r\nSpongeBob: Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.\r\nMr. Krabs: You would have?\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nFlying Dutchman: Dutchman's residence.\r\nSpongeBob: So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`56b\r\nI Had an Accident\r\nPatrick: Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks.\r\nSandy: See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm listening to you, mountain!  Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Oh, yeah, I forgot.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, watch me do the \"Grouchy Squidward\".\r\nSquidward: Stop naming moves after me!\r\nSpongeBob: Everybody's an idiot except for me.\r\nSquidward: Well, it's true.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?  Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, ‘cause I'm an...  Expert...!  Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down!\r\nSandy: SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!\r\nSpongeBob: Like this?\r\nPatrick: No, your other bottom!\r\nSandy: Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?\r\nPatrick: Not until 4.\r\nSandy: Ooh, that's gotta hurt.\r\nPatrick: Do it again! I wasn't looking!\r\nDoctor: Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.\r\nSpongeBob: My what has a what now?\r\nDoctor: Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing.  It took twenty hours to put it all back together.  We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick . Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there.   In the Iron Butt.\r\nTom: Aww, man. It itches.\r\nSpongeBob: You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol.  Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!\r\nHarold: What's your problem?\r\nSpongeBob: Whew. That was close.\r\nFootball Player: Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player.  Nice catch, Percy!\r\nJimmy: Hey, SpongeBob!  You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine!  Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.\r\nMartin: Next.\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nSquidward: Is this where the line starts?\r\nSpongeBob: My butt is not safe out here!  No part of me is safe!\r\nSandy: Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy!  Hey, SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: That was fun.\r\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world?\r\nSandy: Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again.\r\nSandy: That's crazy talk!\r\nPatrick: That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk.  Sorry.\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead.\r\nPatrick: Or your other armpit!\r\nSpongeBob: I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking… My people are sedentary.\r\nSandy: Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome?\r\nSpongeBob: I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin.\r\nSandy: Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab?\r\nSpongeBob: No problem!  A really long spatula.\r\nSandy: What about eating?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside!\r\nSpongeBob: Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again.\r\nPatrick: Never ever?\r\nSpongeBob: Never ever ever!\r\nPatrick: Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!\r\nSpongeBob: Never ever never never ever ever never!!\r\nPatrick: Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!\r\nSpongeBob: Never ever...\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Never never never never ever never ever never…\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door?\r\nPatrick: Thank you, Chip.  I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: No!\r\nPatrick: Aww!\r\nSandy: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of.\r\nPatrick: And that's when I  punch him, right?\r\nSandy: Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun.\r\nPatrick: I caught one!  Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting.  I think I caught one!\r\nSandy: We've got to try something else!\r\nSandy and Patrick: ♪Three cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!♪\r\nSandy: Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here.

Don't jump out until I give the signal.\r\nPatrick: Right.\r\nSandy: All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat!  Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year.\r\nSandy: No, really! You've got to come and save me!\r\nPatrick #2: Hey, Sandy,  who's your friend?\r\nSandy: But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.\r\nPatrick #1: I am in the gorilla suit.  I thought I was doing a pretty good job.\r\nSandy: If you're Patrick, then who's that?  Ah! A real gorilla!\r\nSpongeBob: ' Huh?!  Oh, my gosh!  This can't be happening!  This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about!  Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world.  I'm taking my  first step.

I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.\r\nSandy: Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.\r\nFirst half of SpongeBob: You know what I don't understand though?\r\nSecond half of SpongeBob: What?\r\nFirst half of SpongeBob: What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place?\r\nGorilla: Oh!

Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nMr. Krabs: Whee-hoo!\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?\r\nMr. Krabs: The money!\r\nSpongeBob: The money?\r\nMr. Krabs: Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh.\r\nMr. Krabs: You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break.\r\nSpongeBob: Tell me more about summer break.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!\r\nSpongeBob: I've been taught the true meaning of summer.\r\nNarrator: Later...\r\nSpongeBob: Almost closing time, Mr. K.\r\nMr. Krabs: What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there.\r\nMr. Krabs: Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: See anything, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart.  No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.\r\nMr. Krabs: True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do.\r\nSpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!\r\nSpongeBob: Krabby Land, sir?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?\r\nMonroe: Monroe.\r\nMr. Krabs: Nice to meet you, Monroe.\r\nMonroe: Whee!\r\nMr. Krabs: Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.\r\nKids: We promise.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, here we go!

Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!\r\nKids: Yay!\r\nMr. Krabs: Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.\r\nKids: We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!\r\nSpongeBob: Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.\r\nSpongeBob: Stall 'em? How do I do that?\r\nMr. Krabs: I don't know. Be entertaining.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, kids!\r\nMonroe: You're not Krabby the Clown.\r\nSpongeBob: No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!\r\nTyler: Lame.\r\nSpongeBob: Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?\r\nMonroe: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?\r\nTyler: Still lame.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.\r\nKids: You stink! Bring on the clown!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.\r\nKids: Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!\r\nSpongeBob: My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey, kids, check this out.\r\nKids: Woo-hoo!\r\nSpongeBob: I got 'em right where I want 'em.\r\nKids: Woo-hoo! Yeah!\r\nKids: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!  Yeah, woo!  Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!\r\nSpongeBob: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\r\nKids: Yay!  Yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.\r\nMr. Krabs: Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: The kids are using them as... boomerangs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!\r\nSpongeBob: What are we gonna do?\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!\r\nSpongeBob: Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!\r\nMr. Krabs: Get out there and tell 'em!\r\nSpongeBob: Listen, everybody.

Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!\r\nSpongeBob: I'll say you have.\r\nMr. Krabs SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.\r\nSpongeBob: But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?\r\nMr. Krabs: The children? I don't care about the children!  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose!  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest.\r\nKid: Ahem.\r\nMr. Krabs: Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.\r\nMonroe: Get him!\r\nSpongeBob: I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.\r\nSquidward: You mean this morning?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nMonroe: Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!\r\nKids: Yay! Hooray!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.\r\nKids: Hooray!\r\nSpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.\r\nMr. Krabs: Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!

And this isn't just any old weekend.  This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I'm scared!\r\nSquidward: Ho-ho, that would be great!  You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no...   What the...?  SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?\r\nSpongeBob: We are camping.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house.\r\nSpongeBob: Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside.\r\nSquidward: What do you mean, \"have fun inside\"?\r\nSpongeBob: Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.\r\nSquidward: Oh. Bye.  You little sneak! I see what you're doing!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nSquidward: Don't think I can't see what you're doing!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nSquidward: You're saying I can't take it!\r\nSpongeBob: But all I...\r\nSquidward: Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little \"have fun inside\" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside!\r\nSquidward: That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward's gonna come camping with us!\r\nSquidward: Now you'll see how a real... ugh!  ...outdoorsman does it!  Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn.\r\nSpongeBob: That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.\r\nSquidward: It isn't put up yet, you idiots!\r\nSpongeBob: Customization!\r\nPatrick: Genius!\r\nSpongeBob: He's tenderizing the ground!\r\nPatrick: Of course!\r\nSpongeBob: Write that down, write that down!\r\nSquidward: Huh? Voila!  But what could compare to just lying out under the stars?  Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?\r\nSpongeBob: Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows.  Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.\r\nPatrick: Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.\r\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.\r\nPatrick: Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going . Over.\r\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Patrick.  Me too.  SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over.\r\nPatrick: Yummy!  Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!\r\nSquidward: Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls , just as soon as I can get my can opener.\r\nSpongeBob: But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?\r\nSquidward: Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.\r\nSpongeBob: But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.\r\nPatrick: Pretty weenie!\r\nSquidward: All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.\r\nSquidward: Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one \"The Campfire Song Song\". ♪Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...♪\r\nPatrick: ♪Bum! Bum! Bum!♪\r\nBoth: ♪C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!♪\r\nSpongeBob: ♪And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong!

Good! ♪It'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!♪  ♪Oh yeah!♪ Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?\r\nSquidward: No! This is relaxing.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no! I'll save you, Squidward!  Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?\r\nSquidward: Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!\r\nSpongeBob: But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.\r\nSquidward: A sea bear? You mean like the ones that...  don't exist?!\r\nSpongeBob: What are you saying?\r\nSquidward: There's no such thing! They're just a myth.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer.\r\nSquidward: \"I Married a Sea Bear\"?\r\nPatrick: Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly!\r\nSquidward: \"Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real\"? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\r\nPatrick: Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...\r\nSquidward: You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.\r\nSquidward: Okay. Then what?\r\nSpongeBob: Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.\r\nPatrick: Flashlights are their natural prey.\r\nSquidward: You're kidding.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSquidward: Go on.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't ever eat cheese.\r\nSquidward: Sliced or cubed?\r\nSpongeBob: Cubed. Sliced is fine.\r\nSquidward: Yeah, yeah, and?\r\nSpongeBob: Never wear a sombrero...\r\nPatrick: ...in a goofy fashion!\r\nSpongeBob: Or clown shoes.\r\nPatrick: Or a hoop skirt.\r\nSpongeBob: And never...\r\nPatrick: Ever...\r\nSpongeBob: Ever...\r\nPatrick: Duh!\r\nBoth: ...screech like a chimpanzee!\r\nSquidward: Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off!\r\nBoth: They're horrible!\r\nSquidward: And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger.\r\nBoth: Why?\r\nSquidward: I don't know...  Just a feeling!\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nSquidward: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nBoth: Squidward, please don't!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt.\r\nPatrick: Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.\r\nSquidward: You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up?\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.\r\nSquidward: Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this?\r\nSpongeBob: No. Like that.\r\nthe screaming Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick are still huddled inside their anti-sea-bear circle\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, are you okay?\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nSpongeBob: Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back!\r\nPatrick: Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.\r\nSquidward: Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!\r\nBoth: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't run! Sea bears hate that!\r\nSquidward: Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.\r\nBoth: No!\r\nSpongeBob: They hate limping more than running!\r\nSquidward: Well, I guess I'll just have...\r\nSpongeBob: I should have warned you about crawling.\r\nSquidward: What'd I do that time?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.\r\nPatrick: Pretend to be somebody else!\r\nSpongeBob: Here, draw a circle.\r\nSquidward: Okay.\r\nSpongeBob: That was an oval. It has to be a circle!\r\nSquidward: Move over!  Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros!\r\nSquidward: What attracts them?\r\nPatrick: The sound of a sea bear attack.\r\nSpongeBob: Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh.

I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.\r\nTed: So, anyway, thanks for the pen.\r\nWaitress: No problem, hon.\r\nSpongeBob: It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.\r\nTed: I've gotta go.\r\nSpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gare?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!\r\nSadie: What is it, Peterson?\r\nPeterson: I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance.\r\nSpongeBob: That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Uh oh.

When exactly did you lose your identity?\r\nTed: Yeah, and who's Patrick?\r\nDiner Chef: And why did you eat Snail-Po?\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.\r\nCustomer: Thanks, uh...  Oh.\r\nSpongeBob: Is there a problem?\r\nCustomer: Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.\r\nSpongeBob: While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh?\r\nSquidward: Uh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.\r\nSpongeBob: But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it?\r\nBank Robber: Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?\r\nSquidward: Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world?\r\nMr. Krabs: Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.\r\nSpongeBob: Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.\r\nSquidward: Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...\r\nSpongeBob: Cover me till I get back, okay?\r\nSquidward: Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey!\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning.\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, hi Patrick.  You said hi to me this morning, right?\r\nPatrick: As I do every morning.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I need you to do it again.\r\nPatrick: That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you talking about?\r\nPatrick: My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps.\r\nPatrick: You lost your name tag?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?\r\nPatrick: I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say \"hi\", just like this morning.\r\nSpongeBob: Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!\r\nPatrick: What?\r\nSpongeBob: You were supposed to say hi to me!\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh. All right, let's take it from the top.\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't forget your line this time!\r\nPatrick: I won't.\r\nSpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah.  Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!\r\nPatrick: What's my motivation?\r\nSpongeBob: Forget the motivation! Just say hi!\r\nPatrick: Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry.  I'm sorry. Let's try it again.  Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai...  Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people.  I've got the giggles.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.\r\nPatrick: Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?\r\nSpongeBob: Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys!\r\nPatrick: That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.\r\nPatrick: Well, then we'll look in the dumpster!\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, what is that stench?\r\nPatrick: That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost.  Hop on, pal.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.\r\nPatrick: I wish I had a nose.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.\r\nPatrick: Cannonball!\r\nSpongeBob: You look over there and I'll look over here.\r\nPatrick: Okay.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I'm looking. I'm looking.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick!\r\nPatrick: I'm looking as fast as I can.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick!  Thank you.\r\nPatrick: Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?\r\nSpongeBob: Have you  forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!\r\nPatrick: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.\r\nPatrick: Could I have another hint?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got  one minute till inspection.  One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time.\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob...\r\nSpongeBob: Not now, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: I know where your name tag is.\r\nSpongeBob: Where?! Where?!\r\nPatrick: Uh... I can't remember.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I don't have time for this!\r\nPatrick: There it is!\r\nSpongeBob: Where?!\r\nPatrick: Uh...  I forgot again.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you with me or against me?\r\nPatrick: Could you give me a hint?  There! I see it!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!\r\nPatrick: Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.\r\nSpongeBob: My shirt backward...  What the...?  My shirt's on backwards!  I had my identity all along.  Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Don't mention it, buddy.\r\nMr. Krabs: Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.\r\nSquidward: Hoorah.\r\nMr. Krabs: Okay, boy, your turn.\r\nSpongeBob: I think you'll find everything shipshape.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?\r\nSpongeBob: Uh... discovery?  And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story.\r\nWaitress: Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks, uh...  Betty.\r\nWaitress: What?  Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty.

Will this cover it?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, sure.  Here you go.\r\nRobot: Good day.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good.\r\nPlankton: AH-HAH!\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!\r\nPlankton: That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!\r\nMr. Krabs: Or what?\r\nPlankton: ...I don't know.

You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...\r\nPlankton: Henchmen?\r\nKaren: Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.\r\nPlankton: I like the sound of that.

I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean.

Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  Aha!  Okay, that's enough!

Look around you, Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: You planted grass?\r\nPlankton: GRASS?!?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton.\r\nPlankton: You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination.\r\nPlankton: Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left...\r\nMr. Krabs: Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!\r\nPlankton: Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!\r\nFamily: Ahem.\r\nPlankton: Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family.\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.\r\nPlankton: Begging won't help.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.\r\nPlankton: Eye.\r\nMr. Krabs: Eye.\r\nPlankton: I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good.  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! Wait!\r\nPlankton: ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm warning ya...!\r\nPlankton: ...A cup of love...!\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't do it!\r\nPlankton: ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?!\r\nMr. Krabs: I warned ya.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey. Why ain't you running?\r\nClem: Well, I can't read.\r\nMr. Krabs: Get out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, guys. Did I miss anything?\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?\r\nMr. Krabs: Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out.\r\nSquidward: Let me guess.

I'm gonna run away, that's what I'll do! Run away!\r\nPotty: Sheesh, what a hothead!\r\nAnnouncer: And now, the real Lost Episode!\r\nPotty: Brawk! Patchy, come back! There's more!\r\nPatchy: Really?  Hooray! Let's watch!\r\nFrench narrator: Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter.  He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security.  And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action.\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?   Ooh!  Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty.  ♪If only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.♪  ♪I would fly so very high and touch the sky.♪  ♪And never have to ask why it is that I can't fly♪  Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants.\r\nGrandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine!\r\nPatrick: What's that contraption, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: That, Patrick, is a flying machine.\r\nSpongeBob: What's so funny?\r\nPatrick: Well, it's like my grandpa used to say.\r\nGrandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly, uh... hey, I'm not your grandfather!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, here I go, Patrick!  I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check!  Landing gear...  check! Complimentary peanuts...  check-a-roo.  Ready for takeoff!\r\nPatrick: You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't remind me.\r\nJenkins: I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines! Now git!\r\nPatrick: We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders...  This one's gonna fly!  I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Ready!\r\nSpongeBob: It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm...  falling!  Ooh!\r\nSpongeBob: This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly!\r\nPatrick: Oh boy, a birthday party!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three.  All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  Huh?  Well, back to the drawing board.\r\nPatrick: Can we have the cake now?  Happy, happy birthday to you!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, get ready to say \"Eureka!\"\r\nPatrick: Okay!\r\nSpongeBob: Go!  It's working! I'm flying!\r\nCap Fish: Hey! Look at that guy tied to a kite!\r\nFred: Why's he doing that?\r\nNancy: Oh my goodness...\r\nFred: Why's he doing that?\r\nCap Fish: He'll fall and break his...\r\nNancy: Can you see from up there?\r\nSpongeBob: Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you.  D'oh!  Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick!  Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite.\r\nVendor: Hey... I know you. Yeah, from today's paper!\r\nSpongeBob: \"Local nutcase tries to fly\"?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs, too!\r\nVendor: No they didn't.\r\nSpongeBob: You'll see.\r\nMonroe: Look mom, it's the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom.\r\nMable: Wow! I wonder why he's still using his legs.\r\nMonroe: Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly!\r\nCap Fish: Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?\r\nNancy: Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.\r\nSpongeBob: Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!\r\nMother #2: You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?\r\nStubble Fish: I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers.\r\nNat: We all had dreams.\r\nNancy: What makes you so special?\r\nMob: Let's get him!\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nNat: Good riddance, dreamer!\r\nSpongeBob: Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon.\r\nFrench narrator:  Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned.\r\nSpongeBob: There they go again, Gary.  I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life.  Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true.  Back to reality.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: No, Gary, my dreams are silly.  Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What?  No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Momma? Well, listen up, Joe.  I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary!  I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!\r\nMonroe: Mom, look! It's the flying guy!\r\nMable: Wow, I guess he wasn't a lunatic after all.\r\nSpongeBob: ♪I'm flying.

The light in the Goo Lagoon lighthouse went out, and Sailor Jenkins is headed for the coastline!\r\nJenkins: I'm glad I gave up farming!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm coming!\r\nNat: Thanks, mysterious flying man!\r\nJenkins: I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines!\r\nSpongeBob: That's enough good deeds for one day. I've got a date with a flock of jellyfish.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Son! I need you and your magical pants!\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality.\r\nMr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, it's an emergency!\r\nSpongeBob: Let's roll!  Where to, Mr. K?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh... my garage.\r\nSpongeBob: You've got it!  What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Are you sure you're up for it, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: I think my pants can handle it.\r\nMr. Krabs: I need you...\r\nSpongeBob: Yes?\r\nMr. Krabs: To clean...\r\nSpongeBob: Clean up crime?\r\nMr. Krabs: My garage.\r\nSpongeBob: That's your emergency?\r\nMr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly!\r\nSpongeBob: All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors!  All done, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: And the recyclables?\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, shrimp.  Finally! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick's in trouble.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: What is it, buddy?\r\nPatrick: Will you scratch my tummy?

Mmm... oh yeah!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm supposed to be at Jellyfish Fields right now. But instead, I'm rubbing your scalp. And I don't even know who you are.\r\nGray Fish: But, we went to elementary school together.\r\nSpongeBob: Dennis?\r\nDennis: Mmm... oh yeah!\r\nCap Fish: SpongeBob!\r\nMonroe: Hey SpongeBob!\r\nFred: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: If I don't give these feverish favor-seekers the slip, I'll never get to fly with the jellyfish.\r\nMonroe: Hey! There he is!\r\nMonroe: He's getting away!\r\nLight Purple Fish: No! He owes us favors!\r\nMonroe: Get him!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm almost at Jellyfish Fields.

Come on, everybody! I think a proper burial is in order.  A pair of pants like these come around... once in a lifetime.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it was fun while it lasted.  I guess I'm not meant to fly after all.  Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants! I guess it just goes to show...  ♪You don't need a plane to fly♪  ♪Plastic wings may make you cry♪  ♪Kites are made for windy days.

I'll leave that to the jellyfish.\r\nPatrick: Suit yourself.\r\nSpongeBob: Did Patrick just...?  Nah!\r\nPatchy: Wow! Wasn't that great, kids?\r\nPotty: Let's watch it again.\r\nPatchy: That's a great idea, Potty.  Where's the remote?  Where's the remote?  Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things...

I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.\r\nStrangler: Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes.\r\nSquidward: How's it going, Lieutenant?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.

You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?\r\nStrangler: Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man.  Or that baby.\r\nSpongeBob: Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium!\r\nStrangler: Huh? Uhh, that's mine.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?\r\nStrangler: Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...\r\nSpongeBob: We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!\r\nStrangler: Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected.  Perfect.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.\r\nStrangler: Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.\r\nSpongeBob: Quick is my middle name!  Let's see...paper towels.

Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...  And his dried-up sea leprechaun.  And a bit of gold never hurt.  But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot,  got me shivering timber brace,  and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down.  And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor. And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon—the specter deflector!  So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Wha?\r\nSpongeBob: Krabs, we've come to haunt you.\r\nMr. Krabs: Stay back, I'm well-armed!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm warning ya!\r\nMr. Krabs: Ooh!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Boo.\r\nMr. Krabs: I gotta get out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.\r\nMr. Krabs: You'll never get me!\r\nPatrick: Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber!\r\nSpongeBob: Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets.\r\nMr. Krabs: Please, spirits, leave me be.\r\nPatrick: We got him good, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.  You're going to pay, Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, spirits, please!\r\nSpongeBob: Pay!\r\nMr. Krabs: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Pay!\r\nMr. Krabs: No! Don't burn me dollar!

Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me.  Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.\r\nMr. Krabs: Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.\r\nPatrick: Me too.\r\nMr. Krabs: Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't mention it.\r\nSpongeBob: That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me.

That's totally unfair. Couldn't we get to work earlier than six a.m.? Like 5:30 a.m.? Or 5:00 a.m.? Or 4:00 a.m.? Or--\r\nSquidward: Zip it!\r\nMr. Krabs: What the...?

Haven't you ever heard of a bank?!\r\nMr. Krabs: No!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: No!\r\nPatrick: And we got you a card.\r\nMr. Krabs: Is there money in it?\r\nPatrick: Nope.\r\nSpongeBob: Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?\r\nDoctor: Mr. Krabs is in a cash-coma. Only the return of his money can save his life.\r\nSquidward: It was SpongeBob's fault! Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea!\r\nPatrick: I knew it!\r\nPolice Officer: Not so fast!  This card says \"This was all my idea. Love, Squidward.\" If Mr. Krabs doesn't pull through, you're going to jail.\r\nSquidward: Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd...  ... help you do it myself.\r\nPatrick: Wow, he really does care.\r\nPatrick: What a dump.\r\nSpongeBob: We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us.\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?\r\nSpongeBob: Terrific, Patrick, you found it!\r\nSquidward: What? Where? Lemme see. Where?\r\nSpongeBob: Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm.\r\nSquidward: Oh, that figures.\r\nDoctor: Oh no, this is horrible.\r\nNurse: What is it, doctor?\r\nDoctor: This man has no insurance.\r\nNurse: He'll never be able to afford this room!\r\nDoctor: You're right, nurse. Extract the patient to the hallway. Stat!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it.\r\nSquidward: Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm.\r\nPatrick: Why not?\r\nSpongeBob: Because that would be rude, Patrick.\r\nSquidward: And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!\r\nPatrick: Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?\r\nSquidward: Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe.\r\nPatrick: Gee, thanks, buddy.\r\nSquidward: My pleasure. Now let's get a move on.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here.\r\nPatrick: Wow.\r\nSquidward: What are you morons doing?\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here.\r\nPatrick: Where? I can't see them.\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Wow.\r\nPatrick: Let's do it again.\r\nSquidward: What did you idiots do?\r\nPatrick: Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too!\r\nSquidward: I didn't do it! You blockheads woke...  the... worm.\r\nDoctor #2: Doctor?\r\nDoctor #1: Yes, doctor?\r\nDoctor #2: Regarding your patient, doctor. I have come to this conclusion.\r\nDoctor #1: Yes, go on.\r\nDoctor #2: We have to surgically remove him out from in front of the candy machine so I can get to the nutty nut bar.\r\nDoctor #1: Of course. Nurse?\r\nNurse: I'm on it.\r\nSpongeBob: Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out.\r\nSquidward: Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out.\r\nSpongeBob: Understood. Out.\r\nSquidward: No! In! Out.\r\nSpongeBob: Understood. Out.\r\nSquidward: Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?\r\nSpongeBob: Affirmative.\r\nSquidward: Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it.\r\nSpongeBob: Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'.\r\nPatrick: Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'\r\nSpongeBob: I dunno.  Great idea, Patrick!\r\nSquidward: And my perfect plan falls into place.\r\nPatrick: Uhh, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I think I know why our code name is \"Worm-bait\".\r\nSpongeBob: Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm.\r\nPatrick: Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, I think you're right, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: See if he plays catch.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, see the stick, boy?  Go get it, boy!\r\nSquidward: Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius.  Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket.  And now for the mattress.  I should've guessed.\r\nAdministrator Flotsam: Excuse me, doctor.\r\nDoctor: Administrator Flotsam, what can I do for you?\r\nAdministrator Flotsam: It has come to my attention that your patient, Mr. Krabs, is outside on the front sidewalk.\r\nDoctor: Yes, yes he is.\r\nAdministrator Flotsam: What were you thinking, man? We're trying to run a business. We can't leave patients on the sidewalk.\r\nDoctor: Not to worry. Nurse!\r\nNurse: I'm on it.\r\nSquidward: Alright, you two, what's the holdup?\r\nSpongeBob: We feel silly.\r\nSquidward: Come on, do it for old man Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.  Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Sure, but first, put on this cologne.\r\nSpongeBob: Steak sauce?\r\nSquidward: Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell \"Trick or treat!\" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress.\r\nPatrick: Gimme that cologne.\r\nSquidward: Now get in there!\r\nSpongeBob: Happy Halloween, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: I am not going to get hurt this time.  Isn't that Mr. Krabs?\r\nPatrick: That guard worm doesn't look very happy.\r\nSpongeBob: Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!\r\nMr. Krabs: It's... me money!  Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs.  No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!\r\nPatrick: Trick or treat.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed as meat?\r\nSpongeBob: Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Oh, I give up.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`62b\r\nKrabs vs. Plankton\r\nPlankton: And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty.\r\nKaren: Maybe today will be the day?\r\nPlankton: Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife.\r\nKaren: Do you even have a plan?\r\nPlankton: Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula...\r\nSpongeBob: Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there.\r\nMr. Krabs: Look at you, Plankton. Once again, you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula.  Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula.  And you never will!  How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure?\r\nCharlie: There really should be a \"Wet Floor\" sign.\r\nNat Peterson: Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got.\r\nPlankton: Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?\r\nCharlie: Of course.\r\nPlankton: Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.\r\nMr. Krabs: Sue?!\r\nFemale Customer #1: Oh, that looks bad.\r\nDennis: Uh-oh.\r\nNazz: Poor little man.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?\r\nPlankton: Well... if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.\r\nMr. Krabs: Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!\r\nPlankton: See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean...  Oh, the pain! The deep-frying pain!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.\r\nMr. Krabs: What I really need is a good lawyer.\r\nRichard: Hello, did somebody say \"lawyer\"?  Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.\r\nMr. Krabs: So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?\r\nRichard: Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.\r\nRichard: In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.\r\nRichard: Does that happen a lot?\r\nSpongeBob: No, they're usually silver.\r\nSpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: What is it, lad?\r\nSpongeBob: I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.\r\nMr. Krabs: Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a...  of a liability than an asset.\r\nSpongeBob: But I...\r\nMr. Krabs: Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places.\r\nRichard: Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!\r\nRichard: Wracked...with pain...can't move.\r\nSpongeBob: But what about Mr. Krabs' case?\r\nRichard: Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.\r\nSpongeBob: But, I'm a...a liability.\r\nRichard: Everything you need to win...  is in this here case.\r\nSpongeBob: Really? Everything?\r\nRichard: Uh huh. Everything but a suit.\r\nSpongeBob: A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.\r\nPlankton: I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.\r\nMr. Krabs: Never, you little runt!\r\nPlankton: Oww, oww! My wittle arm!\r\nMr. Krabs: What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.\r\nPlankton: Oww!

It's uhh, all in here  .\r\nMr. Krabs: Really?\r\nSpongeBob: Yep, right in here.\r\nMr. Krabs: Is there a problem?\r\nSpongeBob: Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination.\r\nLawyer: Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?\r\nPlankton: Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.\r\nMr. Krabs: Pull yourself together, boy.\r\nPlankton: Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.\r\nMr. Krabs: How's it coming, lad?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case.\r\nPlankton: Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  that had been intentionally  covered with a viscous fluid.\r\nSpongeBob: Bombs away!\r\nPlankton: Ahem! Are you quite finished?\r\nSpongeBob: Mm-hmm.\r\nPlankton: Now where was I? Oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed.  I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram! Sorry!  Thank you for your kind attention.  Suckers.\r\nStickleback: Does the defense...  have an opening statement?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!\r\nPlankton: Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?\r\nMr. Krabs: It's a \"wet floor\" sign.\r\nPlankton: Do you own one?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed... superfluous.\r\nCourt Audience: Guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty.\r\nPlankton: No more questions.\r\nStickleback: Your witness, Mr. LawyerPants.\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nStickleback: Sometime today, Mr. Pants.\r\nSpongeBob: May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar  and dropped it in the blender?\r\nMr. Krabs: No! No-no! No!  Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here.  A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain.  Daddy didn't forget ya.\r\nStickleback: Does the defense have any witness to call?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?\r\nSquidward: Yes.\r\nMr. Krabs: What?!\r\nSpongeBob: Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?\r\nSquidward: Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying?\r\nMr. Krabs: Must...open...case.\r\nSpongeBob: So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it?\r\nSpongeBob: Answer the question!  Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm doomed.\r\nMr. Krabs: You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open!\r\nMr. Krabs: It's...  It's just his lunch. Or is it?\r\nSpongeBob: Defense calls Plankton to the stand.\r\nSpongeBob: Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?\r\nPlankton: To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?\r\nSpongeBob: Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?  Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty...\r\nPlankton: Uhh...uhh...uhh  I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Yippee! Finally it's mine!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'll take that!\r\nPlankton: Huh? No, no, no!\r\nMr. Krabs: Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp.\r\nPlankton: No, no, no, no!\r\nStickleback: Has the jury reached a verdict?\r\nTom: We have, your honor. We find the defendant not guilty...but he is cheap.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.\r\nSpongeBob: That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.\r\nMr. Krabs: A present? For me?\r\nSpongeBob: Close your eyes and hold out your hand.  It's a \"wet floor\" sign. I made it myself.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, it'll do.

Whoo! Yeah!  What's this? \"Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row.\" Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Darn it.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Darn it.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: What was that?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble—terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion.  Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it.  Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying.  Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get!  And leave your master to his important affairs.  Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nPatrick: I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him.  That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand.  Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Darn it.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, is that you?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, darn it. Darn it.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Darn it. Darn it.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, what happened?  This picture is crooked.

But then I lost the trophy they sent me.\r\nSpongeBob: You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat.

Fresh seahorse milk.\r\nPatrick: Thanks, buddy.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important?  Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it—I gotta feed Gary.  That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours.  Gary! Dinner!  Come on, Gary, soup's on.  Gary? Hey, Pat?\r\nPatrick: Yeah?\r\nSpongeBob: How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?\r\nPatrick: About a week.\r\nSpongeBob: A week? Are you sure?\r\nPatrick: Hmmm... well...  Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.\r\nSpongeBob: Ten days? Gary!  Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!

They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.\r\nPatrick: Eight?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it.  Let me see that.  Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new...\r\nPatrick: I only tasted six types of sediment.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here?  Gary!

Find him yet, Pat?\r\nPatrick: No, but I'll keep looking.\r\nSpongeBob: But there's nowhere left to look.\r\nPatrick: There's one place we haven't checked.\r\nSpongeBob: I doubt Gary could fit in there.\r\nPatrick: Can't hurt to look.\r\nSpongeBob: Here goes nothing.  Look, Pat!\r\nPatrick: What is it?\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see. \"Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me.\" Dear Neptune, what have I done?\r\nPatrick: What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See?

Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.\r\nGary: Mmm.\r\nGramma: Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again.  There you go.  After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised.  Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system.  Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter.  You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie.  Oh.  Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary! Gary? Gary!  Gary!  Gary...!  Oh... Gary!\r\nGramma: Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time.  It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nPicture of SpongeBob: Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy?\r\nGramma: Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.\r\nGary: Meow?\r\nGramma: Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh,  I almost forgot your good night kiss.  Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...\r\nMr. Krabs: Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on.  Knew I'd figure it out.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary.\r\nEvelyn: Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.\r\nMr. Krabs: Refund?! What's wrong with it?\r\nEvelyn: Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears!\r\nMr. Krabs: What the...?\r\nSpongeBob: Gary...\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!\r\nSpongeBob: This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.\r\nMr. Krabs: Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, you see...\r\nMr. Krabs: That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.\r\nSpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's me boy!\r\nSpongeBob: If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wh...?\r\nPatrick: It's the apocalypse!

We've got work to do.\r\nGramma: There you go, Miss Tuffsy—fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nGramma: How about a little more syrup on those pancakes?  Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo!  Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy.  Oh, here we are.\r\nSpongeBob: Here's a good spot.  \"Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob\". Quick, hand me the tape.\r\nPatrick: Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, this is no time for that.\r\nPatrick: Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.\r\nGramma: These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.\r\nPatrick: Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!\r\nGramma: Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.\r\nPatrick: Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary.\r\nSpongeBob: There.\r\nPatrick: When Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half Um...uhh...\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out.\r\nGramma: Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.\r\n♪Gary, now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary. Gary, come home. Gary, can't you see I was blind, I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet, you're my best friend, too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome.

Easy to do.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nGramma: Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go!\r\nGramma: You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done.  Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies.\r\nSnails in picture: Run!\r\nGramma: You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too.  Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love.  Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.\r\nSnail #3: Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.\r\nGramma: Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling.\r\nSnail #3: Hey!\r\nGramma: Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.\r\nSnail #3: Who?\r\nGramma: You must be starving.\r\nPatrick: Just let it out, buddy. That's right.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.\r\nPatrick: Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood!  They were awesome!\r\nSpongeBob: Gary loves balsa wood!  I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind.  I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, like that.  Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary!  So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`64a\r\nSkill Crane\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open.\r\nMr. Krabs: What?

Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?\r\nMama Krabs: I don't know. I'm meeting him here, tonight.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime!\r\nPlankton: I've reservations for two, tonight.\r\nSpongeBob: Right this way, sir.\r\nPlankton: Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!\r\nSpongeBob: Terribly sorry, sir.  Will there be anything else?\r\nPlankton: Is my tie on straight?\r\nSpongeBob: You look fabulous!  Your gentlemen caller awaits.\r\nPlankton: Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight.\r\nMama Krabs: Oh, my, you're a tiny thing, but awfully cute. Tell me about yourself.\r\nPlankton: Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.\r\nMama Krabs: Never heard of it.\r\nPlankton: It's across the street.\r\nMama Krabs: Doesn't ring a bell.\r\nPlankton: It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad!  Never mind, never mind. I'd like to hear about you.\r\nMama Krabs: Well...\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton!\r\nPlankton: Krabs!\r\nMama Krabs: Eugene!\r\nMr. Krabs: Mommy?\r\nPlankton: \"Mommy?\"\r\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob...!\r\nPlankton: This delectable creature is your mother?\r\nMr. Krabs: This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?\r\nSpongeBob: And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skulduggery you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out.\r\nMama Krabs: Eugene, you put me boyfriend down, this instant!\r\nPlankton: Boyfriend?\r\nMr. Krabs: But, mommy...\r\nPlankton: You heard the lady. Let me go.\r\nPlankton: That's more like it.\r\nMama Krabs: Come, Plankton. I'm sorry me son had to spoil our romantic evening.\r\nMr. Krabs: Mommy?  You!\r\nPlankton: Eugene.\r\nMr. Krabs: I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.\r\nPlankton: I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.\r\nMr. Krabs: All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.\r\nPlankton: What are you talking about?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!\r\nPlankton: Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family!  I'm telling you for the last time: stay away from me mother.\r\nPlankton: Not family, eh? I can fix that.\r\nMama Krabs: Eugene!\r\nMr. Krabs: Mommy!\r\nMama Krabs: What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?\r\nMr. Krabs: Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.\r\nMama Krabs: For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula. I doubt that he even knows that I know it.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.\r\nMama Krabs: I forbid ye to interfere in me private business. Go to your office, now!\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, mommy.\r\nPlankton: Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.\r\nMama Krabs: Oh, Sheldon.\r\nPlankton: Oh, Mrs. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, brother.\r\nPlankton: Attention, attention, everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.\r\nCrowd: Aw!\r\nPlankton: Would you marry me?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man!\r\nPlankton: Gasp!\r\nMr. Krabs: Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!\r\nPlankton: Too late, Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son!  Huh? What's this, honey bunch?\r\nMama Krabs: I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment.\r\nPlankton: What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there?\r\nRobot Plankton: I... I... this is very uncomfortable. I'll just wait in the car.\r\nPlankton: I don't believe this! You led me on!\r\nMama Krabs: Now, now, Plankton, it's not what ye think.\r\nPlankton: I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.\r\nMama Krabs: The formula? Is that what this whole thing was about?\r\nPlankton: No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh.  Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost than never to be loved at all!\r\nKaren: Working.\r\nPlankton: So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?\r\nKaren: What did you say?\r\nPlankton: Nothing, dear.\r\nKaren: Yeah, that's what I thought you said, honey bunch.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`68a\r\nPatrick SmartPants\r\nPatrick: You're it.\r\nSpongeBob: You're it.

Here's your head.\r\nPatrick: I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'!  Go ahead, you get first crack.\r\nPatrick: Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.\r\nSpongeBob: Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.\r\nPatrick: Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick.  Look, buddy, I captured one!\r\nPatrick: Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay...what do you wanna do?\r\nPatrick: Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.\r\nSpongeBob: Pretty.\r\nPatrick: Yes, quite.\r\nSpongeBob: Fragile.\r\nPatrick: Indeed.\r\nSpongeBob: C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun.\r\nPatrick: Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?\r\nSpongeBob: I was thinking more like jumping rope,  1-legged races , or playing duck-duck-hermit crab.\r\nPatrick: Doesn't feel like fun.\r\nSpongeBob: How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?\r\nPatrick: You can't strum a jellyfish.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes!\r\nPatrick: Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going.\r\nSpongeBob: What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon.  Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?\r\nPatrick: Just studying this amazing sub-species.\r\nPlankton: I'll show you subspecies!\r\nSpongeBob: Wanna visit Squidward?\r\nPatrick: Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits.  I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, \"Symphony in Blue.\"\r\nSquidward: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work.  May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.\r\nSquidward: Wow, I never thought to do it like that.\r\nPatrick: Well, that is because you rarely think.\r\nSpongeBob: How do you know so much about music?\r\nPatrick: A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance.  Ah.\r\nSpongeBob: Does that include...  belch-talk-ing?\r\nPatrick: Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar.\r\nSquidward: I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick. Do you think you can be my musical mentor?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, guys?\r\nPatrick: Let's take it from the top.  Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique.  On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin.  Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4...  Stop! Enough!  Find yourself a new mentor!\r\nSpongeBob: Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.\r\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap.\r\nPatrick: No, thanks again.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, maybe later we can play pirates.\r\nPatrick: Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.\r\nSpongeBob: What? What do you mean?\r\nPatrick: I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.\r\nSpongeBob: But Patrick... you're my best friend.\r\nPatrick: I know it's hard, but brace up, chap.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nPatrick: Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.\r\nSpongeBob: Goodbye... Mr... Best friend!  Sandy, you there? I need some professional help.  Patrick?\r\nSandy: Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.\r\nPatrick: Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.\r\nSandy: Oh, really? Well, thanks.  Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?\r\nPatrick: You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.\r\nSandy: What do you mean by that, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.\r\nSandy: Are you suggesting I'm dumb?\r\nPatrick: I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.\r\nSandy: I think you'd better leave.\r\nPatrick: I was only trying to help.\r\nSandy: I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all. I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!\r\nSpongeBob: I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!\r\nPatrick: Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with?  SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories.\r\nPatrick: Aww, the glory days, why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem!  What could it be?  What's different? Ah!  What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!\r\nSpongeBob: Coming...  Patrick, you're kidnapping me?\r\nPatrick: Yes, I am.\r\nSpongeBob: Yay!  What should we do?\r\nPatrick: We are going to have fun. Whatever the cost may be.\r\nSpongeBob: Let's do this.\r\nPatrick: Yes, let's have some fun.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah!\r\nPatrick: Oh, absolutely!  Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.  That was fun, huh Patrick?\r\nPatrick: When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.\r\nPatrick: That's it!\r\nSpongeBob: That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?\r\nPatrick: I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...nge!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Hold on, buddy!  There ya go.  Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again!  Not back there.  Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick!  Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?\r\nPatrick: Quite unchanged, actually.\r\nSpongeBob: I guess... we'll never have fun together again.\r\nPatrick: You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes.\r\nPatrick: Where exactly did you find it?\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, it was right here.\r\nPatrick: Hmmm, impossible! If I landed here, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not there, but here, exactly five meters due north.\r\nSpongeBob: But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over...  Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy.  Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?\r\nPatrick: Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!\r\nSpongeBob: Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal.  Patrick? Say something, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're back!\r\nPatrick: Patrick, you're back.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`68b\r\nSquidBob TentaclePants\r\nTina-Fran: Squidward, we love you!\r\nAudience Member #2: I love you, Squidward.

The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!\r\nSpongeBob: Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\". Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger!  If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born.\r\nSquidward: Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  See?\r\nSpongeBob: Ooh!\r\nMr. Krabs: Come inside.  Isn't it beautiful?\r\nSquidward: Where are all the new hotel employees?\r\nMr. Krabs: My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\".\r\nDave: Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.\r\nMr. Krabs: If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.\r\nDave: Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch.\r\nSquidward: Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.\r\nMr. Krabs: Okay, Squidward, you man the front desk.\r\nPatrick: I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.\r\nSquidward: This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.\r\nPatrick: Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?\r\nSquidward: Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?\r\nPatrick: Sometimes I just need to get away from it all.  Wow, this hotel has everything!\r\nSquidward: Gimme that! Now sign the register.\r\nPatrick: I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study!\r\nSquidward: Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.\r\nPatrick: Oh, okay.  Do you mind?!  Don't look!  Done!\r\nSquidward: Close enough. Here's your room key.\r\nPatrick: I'll need some help with my bags.\r\nSquidward: How can you have bags?!

SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty.\r\nSquidward: Oh, Mr Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor?  I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.\r\nSquidward: Fine. Let's go, Patrick.\r\nMr. Krabs: This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator.\r\nSquidward: What's in these bags, rocks?  Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?\r\nPatrick: I don't tell you how to live your life!\r\nSquidward: Well, here's your room.\r\nPatrick: Wow.\r\nSquidward: Enjoy your stay.\r\nPatrick: Squidward, wait!  Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.\r\nSpongeBob: Your Krabby Patty, sir.  Hey, Squidward, cool rock.\r\nPatrick: Hold on a second, SpongeBob.  Here you are, my good man.\r\nSpongeBob: Why, thank you, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!\r\nSquidward: What now?!\r\nPatrick: I don't like crusts on my sandwich!\r\nSquidward: It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?\r\nPatrick: Peel it.\r\nSquidward: Happy?\r\nSpongeBob: Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.\r\nPatrick: Could you do one more thing for me?\r\nSquidward: Why don't you ask SpongeBob?\r\nPatrick: Good idea, Squidward!\r\nSpongeBob: How may I serve you, sir?\r\nPatrick: I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yes, sir!\r\nMr. Krabs: Hold on.

Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?\r\nMr. Krabs: He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!\r\nMr. Krabs: He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!\r\nSquidward: But, Mr. Krabs...\r\nMr. Krabs: Deny no guests!  Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.\r\nSquidward: A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!\r\nPatrick: Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.\r\nSquidward: That's it! I've had enough!\r\nPatrick: Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!\r\nSquidward: Not anymore. I quit.\r\nMr. Krabs: Quit? You can't quit.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!\r\nSquidward: One room, please. On the top floor.\r\nMr. Krabs: What do you think you're doing?\r\nSquidward: I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where \"we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\".\r\nMr. Krabs: I don't have to rent you a room!\r\nSquidward: I've got cash.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh... here's your room key.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, carry my things to my room.\r\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, guest sir.\r\nSquidward: And you can carry me to my room.\r\nMr. Krabs: And why in tarnation would I do that?

You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!\r\nSpongeBob: Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward.  SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.\r\nPatrick: Hooray!\r\nMr. Krabs: What is it, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.\r\nMr. Krabs: Here's your homemade cookies.\r\nSquidward: These don't taste like anything mom used to make!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, how did your mother make 'em?\r\nSquidward: How should I know?!

These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.\r\nMr. Krabs: So you're all taken care of?\r\nSquidward: Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.\r\nMr. Krabs: What?\r\nSquidward: \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\".  Perfect!\r\nMr. Krabs: This room is exactly the same as when we started!\r\nSquidward: Nothing like getting back to the basics.\r\nMr. Krabs: Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!\r\nSquidward: Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming.\r\nMr. Krabs: The pool's out back!\r\nSquidward: Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim.  Come on in, the water's fine.\r\nMr. Krabs: Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?\r\nSquidward: Nope, that's it.\r\nMr. Krabs: You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!\r\nSquidward: No, I'm good.\r\nSpongeBob: Me, too.\r\nPatrick: Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy!  Cannonball!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.\r\nPatrick: That was a hotel?\r\nNurse: Your bill, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: $15,000?!\r\nSquidward: You're not gonna have a heart attack, are you?\r\nMr. Krabs: Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!\r\nPatrick: This is a hospital?\r\nMr. Krabs: Pack your bags, boys!

I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating School Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusual large number of failings from this classroom.\r\nMrs. Puff: That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.\r\nMr. Fitz: Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times.\r\nMrs. Puff: You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.\r\nMr. Fitz: We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.\r\nSpongeBob: Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?\r\nMr. Fitz: Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.\r\nMrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?\r\nSpongeBob: Seat-belt-aroony. One second.\r\nMrs. Puff: Then what do you do?\r\nSpongeBob: Start the engine?\r\nMrs. Puff: Yes.\r\nSpongeBob: Now what do I do?\r\nMrs. Puff: Drive the boat.\r\nSpongeBob: Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you failed.\r\nSpongeBob: I failed?\r\nMr. Fitz: It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties.\r\nMrs. Puff: I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore?  No more... SpongeBob? I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. \"\" Free at last, Free At Last!\r\nSpongeBob: I got Mrs. Puff fired.\r\nRoderick: Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor.  No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.\r\nPeterson: Does that mean...\r\nRoderick: Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon.\r\nMonroe: Uhh, I'll eat one.\r\nRoderick: Pick your favorite.  How's it taste?\r\nMonroe: It's a delightful taste sensation.\r\nRoderick: No eating in my classroom!  Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class...  Looks like you're the man, Sponge.\r\nSpongeBob: I am?\r\nRoderick: Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive\r\nRoderick: What do you think you're doing?\r\nSpongeBob: Ready for my test, sir.\r\nRoderick: You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first.  This is  most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.\r\nSpongeBob: Crawl?\r\nRoderick: Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two.\r\nSpongeBob: Left turn.  Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!\r\nRoderick: Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.\r\nSpongeBob: Pebble!  Oh whoa!  Oh whoa!  Whew!\r\nRoderick: I'm ashamed of you, cadet.  Tripped up by a wee pebble.  What are you suppose to be learning in my class?\r\nSpongeBob: How to drive, sir?\r\nRoderick: Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. Then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl.  I want you to crawl!\r\nSpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!\r\nRoderick: Now get out there!  Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out.  Here, go take that boat apart.  I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again!\r\nSpongeBob: That'll be easy.\r\nRoderick: Are you sure?\r\nSpongeBob: Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh...  I might need a couple minutes.  It's ready, sarge!\r\nRoderick: Jumpin' jellyfish...\r\nSpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians!  So, umm, how'd I do?\r\nRoderick: How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... HOW YOU DID!\r\nSpongeBob: Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?\r\nRoderick: Not quite.  Now do it blindfolded.\r\nNarrator: Several days later...\r\nSpongeBob: 1003, 1004, 1005.  Ooh, pebble #143.  Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008.  Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13.\r\nRoderick: Congratulations.

Kid with a ball.  Nice boy.\r\nRoderick: Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead.  Very good.  Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts.\r\nRoderick: Excellent work, cadet. What's next?\r\nSpongeBob: Step 2 would be... ignite engine.\r\nRoderick: Step 3?\r\nSpongeBob: Step 3 would be...  ...engage blindfold.\r\nRoderick: What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.\r\nSpongeBob: But I can't do it without a blindfold.\r\nRoderick: Drive, boy! Drive!\r\nRoderick: Mayday! Mayday! You're off course.\r\nMrs. Puff: Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob.\r\nRoderick: The brake son!\r\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.  There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts.\r\nRoderick: I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her.  Come get some!\r\nSpongeBob: Man down. Man down.  Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now.  I can't see! I can't see!\r\nPatrick: My pants!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, I can't see!

Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm \"unteachable\".\r\nMrs. Puff: It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back.  And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion,  so it's as if you never failed.\r\nSpongeBob: I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff.

Great things.\r\nLord Reginald: Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.\r\nDr. Marmalade: Now, now, one miracle at a time.\r\nAll Chimps: Goodbye!\r\nSandy: Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption.\r\nPatrick: My turn.

I'm just excited because tomorrow's a very special day.\r\nMr. Krabs: It is?  Oh, I mean, it is! Very special! Very, very special, indeed!\r\nPearl: You have no idea what day tomorrow is, do you?\r\nMr. Krabs: None at all.\r\nPearl: IT'S MY 16TH BIRTHDAY!\r\nMr. Krabs: I knew that! How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?\r\nPearl: I'm going to be 16! It's only the most important birthday in my entire life. If I don't have a completely awesome party, my whole high school reputation will collapse. I'll have to drop out, I won't go off to college, I'll never leave home. You'll have to support me for the rest of my life.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, we don't want that to happen.\r\nPearl: Then promise me you'll give me a real party this year. And don't be cheap!  Hi, girls.\r\nFriend #1: Hi, Pearl.\r\nPearl: Are you guys coming to my totally coral birthday party tomorrow?\r\nFriend #1: I don't know, Pearl. Is this going to be as totally coral as last year, when your dad passed out paper clips as party favors?\r\nJudy: Remember the time we all had to share one balloon?  Please.\r\nFriend #2: Remember the pony ride?\r\nFriend #1: I can't wait to see how he ruins this year.\r\nPearl: Daddy!\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh-oh. Everybody, brace for impact!\r\nPearl: Tell me you've got something totally coral planned for my birthday party.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set. Why, I've already got the party favors, bubble wrap!  This year's gonna be a blast.\r\nPearl: Daddy, you ruined all my birthday parties, but you better not ruin this one. Now promise me you won't be cheap!\r\nMr. Krabs: I promise.\r\nPearl: Good, because I made a list.  Now I want everything on this list at my party.  Bye. I'll be at the mall with my friends.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy.\r\nSpongeBob: What's this, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.\r\nSpongeBob: I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?\r\nMr. Krabs: Exactly.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.\r\nSpongeBob: Detective work. I'm going undercover.\r\nPearl: So, that's when Marcy told me that Julie said that Angela did like Brad.\r\nFriend #1: Oh.\r\nSpongeBob: Angela likes Brad.\r\nPearl: Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing I have seen in the whole world.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic.\r\nCashier: Mr. Krabs, huh? Quick, how do you spell \"Krabs\"?\r\nSpongeBob: Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.\r\nCashier: Close enough.  There you go, kid.\r\nSpongeBob: That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance.\r\nPearl: Wow, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in the whole world. Glitter gloss!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, I bought the wrong present.\r\nJudy: Pearl, you have got to see this.\r\nPearl: Coming, Judy.\r\nMary: Oh...hmmm...\r\nSpongeBob: Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.\r\nPearl: This is the greatest thing in the whole world!\r\nSquidward: The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: I've had that since the day she was born. I got it on sale.\r\nSquidward: I'm sure she'll love it, Mr. Krabs.\r\nPearl: This sea pony is the cutest thing ever. Do you want to come home and be my pony?  Whee!\r\nJudy: Pearl, come here. This is so coral.\r\nPearl: Oh my gosh, it's Billy Fishkins.\r\nAll: Hi, Billy!\r\nBilly: Meep.\r\nSpongeBob: Isn't he dreamy?\r\nCashier: Price check on 4.\r\nBilly: Meep.\r\nSquidward: I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.\r\nSquidward: Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.\r\nSquidward: Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.\r\nMr. Krabs: You're a real fan, huh?\r\nSquidward: Oh, yeah, I know all their songs.\r\nMr. Krabs: All their songs?\r\nPearl: Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?\r\nFriend #1: It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not.\r\nPearl: Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples.\r\nMr. Krabs: It's almost time for the party to start!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm back, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?\r\nSpongeBob: The delivery truck will be here momentarily.\r\nSquidward: Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Everybody, get into position.\r\nAll: Happy birthday!\r\nJudy: \"It's a boy\"?!\r\nPearl: Daddy!\r\nFriend #1: Stale popcorn.  It tastes like dishwater.\r\nSquidward: It is dishwater.\r\nPearl: Is that supposed to be me?  It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross!\r\nMr. Krabs: Who wants cake?\r\nPearl: Well, the cake does look good.  It's made out of cardboard!\r\nMr. Krabs: And frosting.\r\nFriend #1: Well, Pearl, sixteen lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.\r\nPearl: Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, even better, sweetie. Hit it.\r\nSquidward: Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!\r\nFriend #2: Hey, that is not Boys Who Cry.\r\nJudy: Yeah!\r\nFriend #2: Boo!\r\nFriend #1: What a rip-off!\r\nJudy: This stinks!\r\nPearl: Daddy, how could you? I... gave... you... a list!\r\nMr. Krabs: Pearl, come back!\r\nPearl: You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.\r\nSpongeBob: That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go!\r\nPearl: You bought me a boat?\r\nMr. Krabs: I did? I mean...I did?!\r\nFriends: Wow.\r\nPearl: Oh, daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.\r\nSpongeBob: Just watch.  Hit it, boys!\r\nEndsong: Boys Who Cry \"It's All About You\"\r\nIt's all about you girl, On your sixteenth birthday! Pay attention to you girl, Everyone has to do just what you say. You get your very own spotlight tonight, Cuz it's all about you! Yeah, it's all about Pearl!

Whoo-hoo!\r\nSandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.\r\nSandy: Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.\r\nSandy: But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited.\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.\r\nSandy: There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up.\r\nSpongeBob: All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?\r\nSandy: Yup. That's it over there.\r\nSpongeBob: What make you think that's Karate Island?\r\nSandy: I don't know -- lucky guess?\r\nSpongeBob: Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.\r\nFish: Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, thank you.\r\nMaster Udon: I am Master Udon.\r\nSandy: Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.\r\nSandy: Oh, brother.\r\nMaster Udon: Please, show me some of your moves, Master SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: You hear that, Sandy? He called me \"master.\" Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.\r\nSpongeBob: Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?\r\nSandy: Something smells like rancid rodeo around here.\r\nMaster Udon: Excellent. Truly, you are King of Karate.\r\nSpongeBob: The one and only.\r\nMaster Udon: We must make ready for your coronation.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ready to be King of Karate!\r\nMaster Udon: King of Karate-san, it is time for you to take your rightful place on your throne.\r\nSpongeBob: My throne.\r\nSandy: All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.\r\nSpongeBob: Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, ya'll are getting a bit wily.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?\r\nSandy: Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.\r\nSpongeBob: But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.\r\nSandy: I'm getting off this crazy train!\r\nMaster Udon: Master, don't worry about her. She is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime.  Let the coronation begin!\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy's going to miss out, big time.\r\nSandy: That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting -- and that ain't much.\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nSandy: SpongeBob's in trouble!  SpongeBob is the \"King of Karate\". He doesn't need me.

Man, I really do stink.\r\nMaster Udon: You are one impressive squirrel. You even made a costume change.\r\nSandy: Release SpongeBob!\r\nMaster Udon: Never.  He is forbidden to leave until...he signs this contract.\r\nSandy: What are you talking about?\r\nMaster Udon: Real estate.\r\nSandy: You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?\r\nMaster Udon: Yes. If there was a real Karate Island, I'd be a millionaire.\r\nSpongeBob: You mean I'm not King of Karate?\r\nMaster Udon: No. But you could be King of Condos. Here, let me explain. It's really quite simple.  See, if you invest in a time share here on Condo Island, you can see your equity increase ten-fold.

What do you want to do now?\r\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\r\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\r\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\r\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\r\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\r\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\r\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\r\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get?\r\nSpongeBob: I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton...  ...and this slightly used pair of dentures.\r\nPatrick: And I fell on my head.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money.\r\nSpongeBob: This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, sure, whatever.\r\nSpongeBob: Can we come out now?\r\nMr. Krabs: Goodness, no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn.\r\nSpongeBob: Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?\r\nPatrick: Yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: ♪Oh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.♪  Holy mackerel, look, Patrick! We've struck magic.\r\nPatrick: Is that good?\r\nSpongeBob: Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done.\r\nPatrick: It's the only thing I've ever done.\r\nSquidward: Having fun down there, SpongeBob?\r\nPatrick: Hi, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better.\r\nSpongeBob: Do you wanna make a wish?\r\nSquidward: I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me.\r\nSpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic.\r\nSquidward: There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing wells are just a scam to fool saps like you.\r\nSpongeBob: No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it.  Squidward! You decided to join the party.\r\nPatrick: Party!\r\nSquidward: Let me out of here.\r\nSpongeBob: We were just gonna play some party games.\r\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\r\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\r\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\r\nSquidward: I gotta get out of here.\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Go Squidward! Go Squidward!\r\nSquidward: There's no way to climb out of here.\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe if you had more upper arm strength.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, you should work out more.\r\nSquidward: Well, why don't I just start right now? After all, I got a couple of dumbbells right here.\r\nPatrick: I don't get it.\r\nSquidward: Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic.\r\nPatrick: What does claustrophobic mean?\r\nSpongeBob: It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.\r\nSquidward: No, it doesn't.\r\nPatrick: Ho, ho, ho!\r\nSpongeBob: Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!\r\nPatrick: Ho, ho, ho!\r\nSquidward: It's not working, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Darn.\r\nSpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot.\r\nSquidward: Oh, sorry, SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: And you got your elbow in my ribs.\r\nSquidward: Eww. Patrick!\r\nPatrick: And stop stepping in my potato salad.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey, guys.\r\nSquidward: Stop pushing me, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Oh, you mean like this?\r\nSquidward: No, like this!\r\nSpongeBob: You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place.\r\nSquidward: Patrick, get off of me!  I told you I am claustrophobic!\r\nPatrick: Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here.\r\nSquidward: Patrick!\r\nMr. Krabs: Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got.  Boy, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money.\r\nSquidward: Free. I'm free!\r\nMr. Krabs: Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve of the overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes?\r\nSquidward: The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here.  Ow.\r\nSpongeBob: Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip!\r\nPatrick: Lucky.\r\nMr. Krabs: So how much money did you make last night?\r\nSpongeBob: We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic.\r\nMr. Krabs: The what?\r\nSpongeBob: We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!\r\nMr. Krabs: Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it.  What in the deep blue is that?\r\nSandy: There's a full moon out tonight. Do you like my new telescope I wished for?\r\nSpongeBob: That's great, Sandy!\r\nSandy: That wishing well sure does work.\r\nMr. Krabs: Just a coincidence.\r\nMrs. Puff: What do you think of my new hot rod?\r\nSpongeBob: It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin?\r\nMrs. Puff: No.\r\nSpongeBob: See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat.\r\nMr. Krabs: You mean she stole that boat.\r\nPlankton: Morning, SpongeBob. Krabs. Beautiful day.\r\nSpongeBob: Is that proof enough for ya?\r\nMr. Krabs: You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya.  I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! No!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, where's your magic now?  Oh, where am I? What's going on here?  Uh-oh. I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! Oh no!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`73a\r\nNew Leaf\r\nPlankton: I surrender!\r\nMr. Krabs: Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.\r\nPlankton: There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?\r\nMr. Krabs: What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.\r\nPlankton: Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!\r\nMr. Krabs: But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?\r\nPlankton: Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!\r\nMr. Krabs: Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?\r\nPlankton: What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?\r\nMr. Krabs: Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.\r\nPlankton: Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!\r\nMr. Krabs: You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?\r\nPlankton: No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?\r\nPlankton: I'm serious, Krabs. Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.\r\nPlankton: Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career.\r\nSpongeBob: What's going on Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.\r\nSpongeBob: Whatever you say, cap'n.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now that's an employee who follows orders.  What in blazes is that noise?\r\nPlankton: Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.\r\nMr. Krabs: Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.\r\nSpongeBob: That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Right away, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: Let's party!  Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!\r\nSquidward: This is idiotic.\r\nMr. Krabs: Dance or you're fired.\r\nSquidward: You got it, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: How do you like them apples, you little...\r\nPlankton: Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war.\r\nPlankton: Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe.\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.\r\nPlankton: Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?\r\nMr. Krabs: Grr...\r\nPlankton: But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.\r\nMr. Krabs: Bubkes.\r\nPlankton: Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.\r\nMr. Krabs: Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it.\r\nPlankton: Thanks, but no.\r\nMr. Krabs: A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?\r\nPlankton: Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.\r\nMr. Krabs: Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive!  See?! Who's the one with the problem?!\r\nPlankton: Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow.\r\nPlankton: Get out!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops.\r\nPlankton: What's this?  Hey, Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: I knew you'd come back.\r\nPlankton: You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy.\r\nMr. Krabs: I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton!\r\nPlankton: Coming, coming.  Yo.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, Plankton?\r\nPlankton: Eugene?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, hey.\r\nPlankton: Hey.\r\nMr. Krabs: Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?\r\nPlankton: Yes. I'm still here.\r\nMr. Krabs: Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?\r\nPlankton: Sure.\r\nMr. Krabs: Glad you could make it, buddy.\r\nPlankton: So, what's this about, Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.\r\nPlankton: Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.\r\nPlankton: Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you.\r\nMr. Krabs: That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.\r\nPlankton: Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.\r\nMr. Krabs: And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.\r\nPlankton: Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.\r\nPlankton: I can't believe you would even think...\r\nMr. Krabs: Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.\r\nPlankton: You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, take it.\r\nPlankton: You sure?  Life is good, Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure is, buddy. Sure is.\r\nPlankton: Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo!  I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked!

And I haven't even been bitten.\r\nFrank: Oh no, it's spreading through the air!\r\nPerch Perkins: Well, you heard it here first. We're all doomed to a horrible demise.

I'm sorry to break this to you all, but that 'mad snail disease' you're talking about, it doesn't exist.\r\nAll: Huh?\r\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: That's right. No such thing. It's an old urban legend. A myth.\r\nPatrick: Well, does that mean we're not zombies?\r\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Of course not. No one is. It's just mass hysteria.\r\nNathiel: But what about my severely untrimmed...\r\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Those are only moderately untrimmed. All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments.\r\nSpongeBob: Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?\r\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Hmmm... mm-hmm. Ahh! The problem's right here. He's got a little splinter in his foot.  I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden.

Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here.\r\nDelivery Fish: Huh? What's the big idea, here?\r\nPatrick: Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, shhh.\r\nPatrick: It talks!\r\nSpongeBob: Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Not a problem at all, me boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh-huh.\r\nSpongeBob: My house is back that way, Mr. K.\r\nMr. Krabs: Far out, little man. Far out.\r\nSpongeBob: Where'd you say you were taking me?\r\nMr. Krabs: Look, boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!\r\nSpongeBob: It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!\r\nPatrick: Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob? Is that you?\r\nSpongeBob: I've been waiting for you, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh!\r\nSquidward: What’ll be?\r\nCustomer: One Krabby Patty, please.\r\nSquidward: One shell on a shingle.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television.\r\nMr. Krabs: Why'd you do it, laddy?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!\r\nMr. Krabs: You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore.\r\nSpongeBob: You must've saved a fortune.\r\nMr. Krabs: Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! That's more than I make in a year.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.\r\nSpongeBob: Yippee! I happily acquiesce.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`74b\r\nWigstruck\r\nBand Member #1: Man, this is gonna be our most rocking tour, ever.\r\nBand Member #2: Yeah.\r\nNed: Hey, dudes, check out the debut of my new look.\r\nBand Member #1: Whoa, what's that on your head?\r\nBand Member #3: Yeah, is that a wig or a pile of toilet paper?\r\nNed: C'mon, guys, give it a chance.\r\nBand Member #2: Let me try it on.\r\nNed: Hey, you've revealed my shiny dome!\r\nBand Member #2: Hot potato.

The hair's getting into the patties.\r\nSpongeBob: Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.\r\nMr. Krabs: Happy?\r\nSpongeBob: Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.\r\nMr. Krabs: I can imagine.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet.  And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.\r\nSandy: There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice?\r\nSpongeBob: I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?\r\nSandy: Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Glad you like it.

I wish I could give you such nice wigs.\r\nJimmy: How 'bout a little off the top?\r\nTom: Yeah, your wig is big enough to go around.\r\nSpongeBob: This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous.

The entire town is laughing at you!\r\nSpongeBob: I don't understand.\r\nSquidward: Just look at yourself.\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, handsome.  Sss.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before.\r\nSpongeBob: Hmmm, I've never been tall before.\r\nSquidward: That wig is infested with parasites.\r\nSpongeBob: That tickles.\r\nSquidward: Can't you see how ridiculous you look?\r\nSpongeBob: I think that it looks cool.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hahahaha. You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer.\r\nSpongeBob: For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...\r\nMr. Krabs: No buts.\r\nSpongeBob: So I can't have a wig or a butt?\r\nMr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig.

What do you think?\r\nSandy: We need to talk.\r\nSpongeBob: Why would I want to get rid of my wig?

Down in front!; Fish #4: Take the wig off!\r\nSpongeBob: People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.\r\nScooter: That's a great idea! Let's start a riot.\r\nFrank: I told you that movie was terrible.\r\nSandy: Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.\r\nSandy: It's time to be strong.\r\nSpongeBob: I know.  I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!\r\nSandy: Hurry up, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  I'll never accessorize again.\r\nSandy: You did the right thing, SpongeBob.\r\nNed: Where am I gonna get some hair? My career is ruined. Ruined!  Can it be? It is! My wig. Yes!

At least he's not wearing a wig.\r\nPatrick: Look at my new wig.\r\nSpongeBob: Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.\r\nFish #1: Yeah, they were. But look...\r\nSpongeBob: Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?\r\nFish #1: Yes, you were.

I'll shrink the sub and myself to microscopic size..  ...then navigate through  your brain,  down into your throat,  then extract the reed  from inside. Simple!\r\nSquidward: Why don't you just shrink the reed?\r\nSandy: Oh, Squidward, always wanting to do it the hard way  We're all set, Squidward!

All you need to do is locate the autopilot. It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point.\r\nSpongeBob: Um...we broke it.\r\nSandy: Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?\r\nSandy: This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boat mobile, which you've never successfully done.  So, just take it nice and easy.\r\nSpongeBob: No problemo. Nice and...easy!\r\nSquidward: So, how's it going?  I can't control my eyeballs!\r\nSandy: Don't worry, it's temporary.

The guy who's trying to run me out of town.\r\nSpongeBob: The assassin.\r\nPatricia: What can I get you, sir?\r\nSunny Seashores Salesfish: Say, don't I know you from somewhere?\r\nPatricia: No!\r\nSunny Seashores Salesfish: Hmmm... that's it. Get outta town!\r\nPatricia: He's onto us.\r\nSpongeBob: I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town.\r\nSquidward & Mr. Krabs: Patrick?!\r\nSunny Seashores Salesfish: You forgot your flyer.\r\nSpongeBob: Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price.\r\nPatricia: Well, I guess I don't need this disguise anymore.\r\nSquidward: Umm, I think I need to take a shower.\r\nMr. Krabs: So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?\r\nPatrick: No.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well then, you're fired. Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list?\r\nPatrick and SpongeBob: Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooo!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`76a\r\nThe Thing\r\nSquidward: It's too quiet.

Do it again.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nSquidward: Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television.\r\nPatrick: Do it again, do it again.\r\nSquidward: If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward!\r\nSquidward: You're still there, aren't you?\r\nSpongeBob: Good evening, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?\r\nPatrick: Yeah. We're here...\r\nSquidward: Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point?\r\nPatrick: Could you turn it up?\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?\r\nPatrick: Squidward, what's this about?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, how come he's so emotional?\r\nPatrick: Is he the bad guy?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\r\nPatrick: Squidward?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\r\nPatrick: Squidward?\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\r\nPatrick: Squidward?\r\nSquidward: That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again, I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV.\r\nPatrick: Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.\r\nSquidward: I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields.\r\nSpongeBob: What is that thing, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I dunno. Let's get a closer look.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered.\r\nSpongeBob: Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl.\r\nPatrick: And some kibble.\r\nSpongeBob: You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly, meet Gary.  Aww, look at that, Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary!\r\nPatrick: I don't think Gary likes Smelly.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.\r\nPatrick: Ah! He can come live with me.\r\nSpongeBob: That's a great idea, Patrick. You’ve always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly. Have fun at Patrick's.\r\nPatrick: No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house.  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back!

If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.\r\nPolice: Wild animals don't belong here, son. They belong in the zoo. Get 'em, boys.\r\nSpongeBob: Smelly.\r\nIsabelle: Mommy, what is that thing?\r\nSadie: I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it?\r\nSpongeBob: This isn't good.\r\nPatrick: You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard.\r\nSpongeBob: No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Okay, Patrick, remember the plan?\r\nPatrick: Oh, yeah.  This one, right?\r\nSpongeBob: No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.\r\nPatrick: Mmm, good plan.\r\nSpongeBob: All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me.\r\nPatrick: You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah!\r\nSpongeBob: Shh, we'll get caught.\r\nPatrick: What?! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud!\r\nSpongeBob: Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free!\r\nPolice: You're surrounded. There's no use trying to run.\r\nSpongeBob: Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: I'll let Smelly go first.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us.\r\nPatrick: I think we lost them.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, we're all one big happy family again.

Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much.\r\nPatrick: Hey, I see light.\r\nSpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way.\r\nPatrick: I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Me too, buddy. Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong.\r\nKelpy G: Ah... salutation, my children.

What can I do for you, Patrick?\r\nSpongeBob: The king would like...\r\nMr. Krabs: Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.\r\nPatrick: I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...\r\nMr. Krabs: I've got a better idea.  A buffet fit for a king.\r\nPatrick: Tasty.\r\nMr. Krabs: Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.\r\nPatrick: Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?\r\nMr. Krabs: How about you pay the check, instead?\r\nPatrick: Oh, sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free.\r\nMr. Krabs: All free?!!?  Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king!\r\nPatrick: Are you gonna eat that?\r\nHarold: I was planning to, why?\r\nPatrick: I want it.\r\nHarold: Hey! What gives you the right to take my food?\r\nPatrick: Tell him, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about.\r\nPatrick: I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you.\r\nPatrick: Good! Now tell him.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants.\r\nHarold: This isn't fair.\r\nPatrick: Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.\r\nFish: I finally did it! At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition. Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete. Mom's gonna be so proud of me.\r\nPatrick: No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!\r\nFish: But, I've spent my entire life collecting those.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!\r\nFish: I will cry about it.  I'll cry right to my mom!\r\nPatrick: I love being king.\r\nSpongeBob: Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker.\r\nOld Man Jenkins: I hope so. Neptune knows I did.  Oof!\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sire?\r\nPatrick: I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool?\r\nSquidward: Hello, sunshine.  What a beautiful morning. Just perfect.\r\nPatrick: Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good.  Perfect.\r\nSquidward: My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh?  SpongeBob, Patrick. What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.\r\nPatrick: Your front yard?\r\nSpongeBob: Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel.\r\nSquidward: Ferris Wheel?\r\nSpongeBob: I know, isn't it great?\r\nSquidward: No, it's not great! It's horrible. Oh, that's it. Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?\r\nPatrick: Uh...\r\nSquidward: You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything?  King of Morons, maybe.\r\nCrowd: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\r\nWorker: He might be on to something.\r\nSquidward: Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See?\r\nMan: Why are we giving this guy all our stuff?\r\nSquidward: See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so,  too!\r\nPatrick: Get him! Attack! Attack!  SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, right away, your majesty. Umm, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?\r\nSquidward: Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty!\r\nPatrick: My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what's happened to you?\r\nPatrick: I don't know what you mean.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh...  You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and...\r\nPatrick: And what...\r\nSpongeBob: Um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk.\r\nPatrick: Huh?  I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh...well, I...\r\nPatrick: Who's saying I'm abusing my POWER!?!  I'll put the whole town in prison!  Questioning my authority is treason! All these giggly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself!\r\nMirror: Knock knock.\r\nPatrick: Huh?  A knock knock joke!  Who's there?\r\nMirror: You.\r\nPatrick and Mirror: I don't get it.\r\nMirror: I'm you and you are me.\r\nPatrick and Mirror: What have I become?!\r\nPatrick: Aaah, help! Monster! Monster!  Huh? Oh, it's, it's you!  Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.\r\nStarfish: Oh, I think I know what's going on here. Patrick, with great power comes great responsibility.  You haven't a clue what I just told you, do you?\r\nPatrick: No. Uh-uh.\r\nStarfish: Oh, just as well. I've come to take the crown back, as it seems that you aren't royalty after all.\r\nPatrick: Huh?\r\nStarfish: I've discovered this coffee stain, which upon removal, reveals that Sir Gary is the true heir to the king's crown.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!\r\nGary: Meow?\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`78a\r\nBorn to Be Wild\r\nSpongeBob: La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.

Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?\r\nSpongeBob: There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows.

That's another word for hungry, isn't it?  Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%. I'll make a fortune.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, this is serious!\r\nMr. Krabs: That kid needs a vacation -- unpaid of course.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward!\r\nSquidward: Yes, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: A horrible biker gang called the \"Wild Ones\" are coming.

The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?\r\nPatrick: I wouldn't mess with ya.\r\nSpongeBob: Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not.

We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.\r\nMr. Krabs: You're not running off any of me paying customers.

Mind your own business!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net.  I will pay one billion dollars for that net.\r\nPatrick: I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net!  I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, really?\r\nPatrick: You can't have it for any price.\r\nSpongeBob: And why not?\r\nPatrick: This means more to me than money.

So, this is it?\r\nPatrick: Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, don't go. I'm sorry I accused you. It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.\r\nNat Peterson: What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two.  Look, you left your net on the bus again.\r\nSpongeBob: Ol' Reliable?

This concoction is going to blow everyone away.\r\nBilly: How's this for a science experiment, Mr. Brainatron 5000?\r\nKid Plankton: They'll pay for this one day, Eugene!\r\nMr. Krabs: Darn tootin'. Hey, barnacle brains, I think you owe Plankton an apology.\r\nBilly: You're right, Plankton, I'm sorry. Sorry you have to hang out with Rag Boy.\r\nBully #2: Yeah. Where'd you do your clothes shopping? The trash can?\r\nMr. Krabs: 'Twas true. I did get me clothes from the trash.  You see, when I was growing up, times were tough. Me mother had to.... ....fashion me clothes from rags.\r\nMama Krabs: There you go, son. Your outfit's all finished. It's a good thing Old Man Jenkins was kind enough to spare his last washcloth.\r\nOld Man Jenkins: Oops.  I missed a spot.\r\nMr. Krabs: Then one day, as Plankton and I were plotting our revenge, I met the love of me life.\r\nKid Mr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is that?  It's the most beautiful thing me eyes have ever seen! What is it?!\r\nKid Plankton: It's money.\r\nMr. Krabs: Moneyyyyyyyyyy?\r\nPlankton: Yeah. You can buy things with it.\r\nKid Mr. Krabs: Buy things?\r\nMr. Krabs: So, I spent it on a gift for me best pal Plankton.\r\nAll: Wow!\r\nSpongeBob: Got your secret recipe, Mr. Krabs. You have no idea that went through to get here.\r\nMr. Krabs: I've got a pretty good idea, yeah.\r\nSWAT Fish #4: So, if you guys were such great friends, what happened?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, Mr. Krabs. What did happen next?\r\nSquidward: Yeah. I really wanna know.\r\nMr. Krabs: Listen up, Squidward! Because this is where it gets juicy. It all started in a place called \"Stinky Burgers\". It was the only place to get a burger. The kids loved Stinky's.  And Stinky loved the kids.\r\nStinky: Now, what can I do for you young 'uns?\r\nBilly: Uh, Mr. Stinky? I'll have one Stinky Burger, please!\r\nBully #3: Me, too, Stinky!\r\nStinky: Oh, now, now, kids. There's plenty of burgers for everyone.\r\nBig Johnny: That's why we like you so much, Stinky. You always deliver the goods.\r\nBully #5: We don't like Stinky, we respect him.\r\nStinky: Well, which one is it, kids? Do you like me or respect me?\r\nBig Johnny: Like!\r\nBully #5: Respect!\r\nBig Johnny: Like!\r\nBully #5: Respect!\r\nStinky: Okay, let's just meet in the middle and say you li-spect me.\r\nMr. Krabs: Excuse us!\r\nPlankton: Valuable customers coming through.\r\nBig Johnny (in Billy's voice): What are those dorks doing here?\r\nMr. Krabs: Two Stinky Burgers, please.\r\nStinky: Did your brains dribble out all over the sidewalk you slept on last night? If it's burgers you want, go around back.\r\nAll: Yeah, Stinky!\r\nBilly: Thanks for keeping the nerds out.\r\nBully #2: You're the best, Stinky.\r\nStinky: Okay, that's enough, kids. Gather around, children. There's something I want to tell you. What I have to say is very important. If you remember one thing for the rest of your life, remember that without your kind patronage, I'd be a penniless loser like Rag Boy.  Do you two have kelp for brains? Don't you understand? If you two yahoos come around, you'll drive away all the normal customers. I've worked too long and too hard to make this a li-spectable business. As it is, I can barely afford the essential things in li...  Is it quitting time already?  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to enjoy some of life's essentials.\r\nPlankton: Did you hear that, Krabs? By flipper burgers for those cretins, he was able to gain their li-spect.\r\nMr. Krabs: Did you see that fat stack of loot? I bet if we made a better burger, we'd make a fatter stack of loot.  But who has the ability to make such a burger? Who has the skill?\r\nPlankton: Skill, schmill, Krabs, baby. Who needs skill when science is on your side? We'll make that burger, and when we do, we will rule the school!\r\nPatchy: I miss Potty. I remember the first time we met.  If I could only hear his voice.\r\nPotty: Less talking and more working.\r\nPatchy: Potty! You came back to apologize!\r\nPotty: I came to tell you to get back to work!\r\nPatchy: Hey, you can't tell me what to do you... Huh? Assistant manager? How did you become assistant manager?\r\nPotty: Oh, a thing called the G.E.D., man.\r\nPatchy: Oh, here we go again with the fancy booklearnin'. Customers love me cookin. Why, we're almost out of doggie bags.\r\nPatchy: Oh, Potty, what am I doing wrong?\r\nPotty: You just need some practice, that's all.\r\nPatchy: Ahh, me patty's done.\r\nPotty: Smells like an unswabbed poop deck!\r\nPatchy: Oh, Fine. I'll eat it!  Oh, for the crime of befouling me taste buds, I order you to walk the plank!  Ah. Oh, well, I bet SpongeBob's first patty didn't go so well either.\r\nPotty: Brawk, roll film.  A perfect patty on the first try.\r\nPatchy: Oooooh, I'll make a Potty Patty out of you!\r\nPotty: You're unsanitary, Patchy, You keep raw hamburger meat in an old boot!\r\nPatchy: Well, that's what gives it its special flavor.\r\nPotty: You've got rats in the kitchen!\r\nPatchy: Oh, I brush and shampoo them daily. Who's Patchy's little princess?  Ow! Mmmm! Don't do that!\r\nPotty: And you should wash your hands after using the bathroom.\r\nPatchy: What? Every time?\r\nPotty: That's not all! This is a step in the right direction.\r\nPatchy: What kind of a pirate wears a hairnet?\r\nPotty: The same kind who wears a \"Kiss the Cook\" apron.\r\nPatchy: Well, you'll never know, Potty. I might get lucky. You hear that, ladies? Patchy's available. Huh?\r\nPotty: Now I feel sick.\r\nPatchy: That's it, you feathered snake! This time you gone too far!\r\nPotty: Brawk, you missed! Squawk! Is that all you got?\r\nPotty: Now you've done it.\r\nMr. Pirateson: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!\r\nPatchy: Yes, Mr. Pirateson.  You kids watch the rest of the cartoon, while I watch Potty get fired.\r\nMr. Pirateson: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!\r\nPatchy: Coming, Mr. Pirateson, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: So we went back to our secret hideaway, the dump, to prove to those chowder heads that a burger could be semi-edible and easy to swallow. We made sure to keep careful record of our progress.\r\nPlankton: Gently. Gently.\r\nMr. Krabs: We finally emerged the best-looking burger under the sea. We went back to Stinky's to rub our patty in those kid's greasy faces. But Stinky's had been shut down by order of the Health Department. So we seized the opportunity and converted our hideout into a restaurant.  Our adventure into capitalism began. One dollar, please.\r\nPlankton: There you are, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: T'was me first dollar I ever earned, and was also the start of a beautiful, romantic relationship with money.\r\nFish Kid: Hey! Your burger's even worse than Stinky's. We can barely keep them down. And if it weren't for Stinky's shutting down, no one would eat here. So give me a burger. I'm starving.\r\nPlankton: Just look at them, Eugene. The very people who ridiculed me are now feasting on my recipe.\r\nMr. Krabs: I thought it was our recipe.\r\nPlankton: I'm ruling their stomachs. And soon I'll be ruling their minds!\r\nMr. Krabs: But what about satisfying the customer?\r\nPlankton: Barnacles to the customer, I'm talking about ruling the world!  And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!\r\nMr. Krabs: Give me that!\r\nPlankton: Stop! You're gonna bust it!\r\nMr. Krabs: Burgers aren't for ruling worlds!\r\nPlankton: I'm terribly sorry, Eugene, I couldn't hear you. Could you come closer? Maybe stand on the tile in front of you?\r\nMr. Krabs: Which one? The one that says \"Eject\" or the one that says \"Trap Door\"?\r\nPlankton: Oh, either one will do.\r\nMr. Krabs: What I was saying was...  You'll regret this one day!  And he always did.\r\nPlankton: Lies!\r\nMr. Krabs: Hold on there, me boy. We don't need to go through that again.\r\nPlankton: Very touching, but completely false.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't know what you mean.\r\nPlankton: Why don't you tell them the truth?\r\nSpongeBob: It did happen that way, didn't it, Mr. Krabs?\r\nPlankton: Most of it's true, except for what really happened! We had created the tastiest burger. That's when things became unsavory.\r\nMr. Krabs: First, I'll rule their stomachs and then...  ...their money!\r\nPlankton: But what about satisfying the customers?\r\nMr. Krabs: Barnacles to the customers!  I'm talkin' about coins, cash, wallets, bank accounts! And with this secret recipe, nothing will stop me!\r\nPlankton: Gimme that!\r\nMr. Krabs: Stop, you're gonna bust it.\r\nPlankton: This isn't about money, Eugene.\r\nMr. Krabs: Malarkey.\r\nPlankton: You'll regret this one day!  Ouch.  Our little squabble only got me part of the recipe.\r\nSpongeBob: Gosh, Mr. Plankton, that doesn't sound like the Mr. Krabs story at all.\r\nKaren: That's because it isn't.\r\nSpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, & Plankton: Karen?!\r\nKaren: You're both liars. That's not how it happened at all. In those days, I was just starting out as a security system. Plankton and I met when he installed me.\r\nPlankton: It was only our third date.\r\nKaren: Anyways, I had recorded the whole thing in my databanks.\r\nPlankton: Now that's a handsome looking burger.\r\nMr. Krabs: You said it, old chum.  Attention! Get your Plankton and Krabs patties right here!  Do you think it was a good idea to open in the dump?\r\nPlankton: What's that music?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'd know that theme song anywhere. It's Old Man Jenkins. Old Man Jenkins!\r\nOld Man Jenkins: I just been looking for some new shoes for Ol' Bessie.\r\nMr. Krabs: You've help me mom and me through some tough times. It would be an honor if you'd be the first to try our delicious burgers.\r\nOld Man Jenkins: Why, I'd be happy to!\r\nMr. Krabs & Plankton: Yeah!\r\nMr. Krabs: \"Plab Patties KO's Old Man J\". I can't believe we poisoned that sweet old guy.\r\nPlankton: Well, he is old.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey. That guy is like family to me.\r\nPlankton: Well, it was your fault the patty was tainted.\r\nMr. Krabs: You're the one who put too much seaweed sauce in the burger.\r\nPlankton: You let it sit out too long. That's what did it! I'm taking the recipe and fixing it.\r\nMr. Krabs: No way, that recipe's mine!\r\nPlankton: Stop, you're gonna...  You wanna fight over this recipe, I'll give ya a fight you'll never forget!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, that's ruined. But, no use letting this go to waste. These kids'll eat anything.  I've done it. I've discovered the perfect patty batter.\r\nKaren: Meanwhile, Plankton was back at the elementary school. But this time, he was going it alone.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, no you don't! This is my turf.\r\nPlankton: I think not, Rag Boy.\r\nMr. Krabs: What? Why I oughta squash you right now. You little...\r\nPlankton: Get out of my face!\r\nBully #3: Hey, look! Nerd fight.\r\nBilly: I bet five bucks on Rag Boy.\r\nPlankton: Aha! We'll let the customers decide whose burger is better. Step right up, gents. Get a delicious Chum Burger right here.\r\nBilly: Big Johnny will eat anything.\r\nPlankton: Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir.\r\nKaren: Plankton had pieced together his own creation using memory and science.\r\nPlankton: Go on, sir! Tell your buddies what you think!\r\nBilly: I'm gonna try one of Rag Boy's burgers.\r\nMr. Krabs: Here ya are, sir. You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty.\r\nBilly: Flavor!\r\nBully #5: Edible!\r\nBully #'s 2 and 6: We can actually hold it down!\r\nAbigail-Marge: This is the most flavortastic sensation my still-developing taste buds have ever experienced!\r\nAll: Yay, Rag Boy!\r\nPlankton: I'll show you, Krabs! I'll steal that cursed recipe from you one day, and I won't stop ‘til I do!\r\nMr. Krabs: Woo-hoo! My recipe was, is, and always will be the best.\r\nPlankton: You wouldn't have that recipe if it weren't for me.\r\nMr. Krabs: You callin' me a liar?\r\nKaren: Will you men stop yelling at each other? I can't believe you let a recipe ruin such a wonderful friendship.\r\nMr. Krabs: You were my only true friend that didn't have a president printed on him. But money doesn't hug back.\r\nPlankton: My life has been nothing but a long line of disappointments since we became enemies. All these years I've been trying to steal your formula. But I was really just trying to steal back our friendship.\r\nMr. Krabs: Really?\r\nPlankton: It's all I ever really wanted. To get back to the way it used to be. You and me against the world! How about a hug, Krabs, old pal?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'd like that, Planky, old chum.\r\nSpongeBob: Doesn't it just warm your heart, Karen?\r\nKaren: I suppose it would. If I had one.\r\nPlankton: I'm sorry, Krabs, old buddy.\r\nMr. Krabs: Me, too. Me, too.\r\nPlankton: Now, Karen!  Back off, Rag Boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Sabotage!\r\nPlankton: Go, Karen!\r\nPatchy: Ohh, that Plankton never learns, does he, kids? As for me, I decided to take some time off to catch up on me reading.\r\nPotty: Hey, you didn't take time off, you got fired!\r\nPatchy: Hey, you got fired, too!\r\nPotty: I got a golden parachute.\r\nPatchy: Well, at least I know they'll never ever be able to replace me.\r\nPotty: Looks like they already did.\r\nPatchy: What? They let a smelly, hairy, fleabag like that serve food?\r\nGorilla: Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhh!\r\nPatchy: Hey, watch it, ape.\r\nPatchy: Watch the patch! Ow! Ow! No! Please!\r\nGorilla: Ohhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh...!\r\nPatchy: Ooh! I have a tomato allergy! Ow, right in the buns!\r\nNarrator: And so, kids, always remember to follow your dreams, unless you're Patchy.

I'll always treasure these moments we had together.\r\nSquidward: Look!\r\nSpongeBob: Awww...\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'll be cooked in butter! It's Jim, the Original Fry Cook!\r\nJim: Krabs!\r\nSpongeBob: The Jim? He who flipped patties in the before times?\r\nMr. Krabs: You're doin' well, Jim. Is that limo solid gold?\r\nJim: It sure is. I was on my way to my solid gold mansion next to my solid gold lake, when I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.\r\nSquidward: Good ol' Jim! When you worked here, the place had class.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah. When this place had class...  Well, we've had some good times, too. Right, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: No.\r\nJim: Hey, that's new. \"Employee of the Month,\" huh?\r\nSpongeBob: That's me!\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't worry, Jim. No one could ever replace you. The original is still underneath.\r\nMr. Krabs: Your \"Best Employee Ever\" award! SpongeBob! Sweep up this mess while Jim and I catch up.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir.\r\nJim: After I left The Krusty Krab I worked at some of the finest restaurants around the world. I got so successful, I was able to retire in luxury.\r\nSpongeBob: Would you sign my Krabby Patty?\r\nJim: Oh, I... Don't sign what I didn't make.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, bigshot! Why don't you step behind the fryer for old time's sake?\r\nJim: You're on, Krabs! But I'll have to charge you!\r\nMr. Krabs: Aye, you always knew how to make me laugh. You just don't find employees like that anymore.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah. Not unless you look right in front of you!\r\nMr. Krabs: You're right, boy. I appreciate you, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: Now I feel complete!\r\nMr. Krabs: Now how about that patty?\r\nJim: Everyone, watch and learn!\r\nBodyguard #1: No one watches Jim.\r\nJim: One patty! The right way.\r\nMr. Krabs: It's a thing of beauty!\r\nSpongeBob: What's so great about a Jim Patty anyway?  Meh, it's OK.  Wow! That was... amazing!  Uh, Mr. Jim, sir?\r\nJim: Oh, hey! You... You're the guy... who sweeps up, right?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm the new fry cook, sir.\r\nJim: Oh! You made that... stepped-on thing I saw earlier, right?\r\nSpongeBob: Do you have any tips you can pass on to a rookie?\r\nJim: Besides don't step on the food?\r\nSpongeBob: Please critique my work! I wish to learn at the feet of the master!\r\nJim: Now that's the way to grovel. I'll do it!  The pickle slices were too thick.\r\nJim: Hold it... Hold it... Hold it...

I gotta cry, too.\r\nSpongeBob: Why, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Because when Jim leaves, I'll be stuck with you again!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. Jim won't be leaving. He's taking my job. I'm the one who's leaving!\r\nSquidward: Really?  Yes! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Ha, cha-cha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee, hee, Ha! Ha!\r\nSpongeBob: The Krusty Krab deserves better than my meager skills.

Goodbye, frozen patty #1. Goodbye, frozen patty #2.\r\nNarrator: 298 frozen patties later...\r\nSpongeBob: Goodbye, freezer.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  That smells like a resignation letter.  SpongeBob's resignation? Oh, this is terrible! No one's making patties! And that mean I'm not making money!\r\nJim: Hey, Eugene, where's that little fry cook of yours?\r\nMr. Krabs: He thinks you're taking his job, so he's run off!\r\nJim: Hey, great idea! And you can give me a raise!\r\nSpongeBob: Look at them. Mr. Krabs is probably offering Jim my job right now.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I better go find him. SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I was just leaving. I'm not fit to inhabit the same kitchen as Jim. So it is with a heavy heart that I relinquish my position as fry cook.\r\nJim: What are you thinking, SpongeBob? I'm not taking your job.\r\nSpongeBob: But you're the greatest fry cook in the world! The Krusty Krab deserves better than me.\r\nJim: Both those statements are true, SpongeBob, but there's a reason I left the Krusty Krab. It all started on a warm summer evening. Business was slow, so Squidward and I were having one of our famous bull sessions.  We should open our own restaurant and stop relying on old man K's pockets.\r\nSquidward: No, thanks. I'm just doing this until my clarinet career takes off.\r\nJim: What if it never does? Don't you wanna have something to fall back on?\r\nSquidward: Yeah! Ha! I could lose my beautiful, flowing hair, too, but I'm not buying a wig yet.\r\nJim: Well, while you go wig shopping, I'm gonna go talk to Mr. Krabs.  Hey, Mr. Krabs, you gotta second?\r\nMr. Krabs: Anything for you, Jimmy, me boy. Cop a squat and lay your wreck and tell me what's on your wig, Jim.\r\nJim: Cut the gas, Krabs, and dig this: I've been bustin' my conk for you. You better lay on some extra gravy, or I'm going to agitate the gravel.\r\nMr. Krabs: What now?\r\nJim: You know, lay a patch.\r\nMr. Krabs: 'Scuse me?\r\nJim: Give me a raise, or I'm quitting.\r\nMr. Krabs: A raise? That's not in my \"Hiptionary\". Help me get with it, Jack.\r\nJim: Stop talking like that.\r\nMr. Krabs: These sideburns aren't real.\r\nJim: I need more money in my paycheck at the end of every week, capiche?\r\nSquidward: My hair! My beautiful hair! My hair! My hair!\r\nMr. Krabs: Aye, it's still as funny today as it was then.\r\nMr. Krabs: You see, SpongeBob, you've got one quality Jim will never have: you're cheap!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! I never thought about it that way!\r\nMr. Krabs: So, you'll stay?\r\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Then back to work!\r\nJim: Well, Eugene, looks like you've got yourself another sucker. The kid's a good fry cook, but he'll only be a great fry cook when he finally gets the guts to quit this dump. Good luck, SpongeBob. You're gonna need it.\r\nSpongeBob: The Krusty Krab isn't a dump.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, she's a dump, alright.

Karen wants this place to really sparkle. I was thinking it could use a little more pizzazz.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Pizzazz, yeah.\r\nPlankton: Oh, I know. Why don't you paint the entire Chum Bucket?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Whoa, really?\r\nPlankton: Oh, yes. I need you artistic vision. You, wouldn't want to disappoint my Karen now, would you?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: No, sir. Uh-uh.\r\nPlankton: Well, hop to it, lads.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yes, sir!\r\nSquidward: Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe. Heel, toe.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. We like to work.\r\nSquidward: What the--? SpongeBob, what atrocity is this?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh. hi, Squidward. Looky, Mr. Plankton's having us paint. He calls it pizzazz.\r\nSquidward: Pizzazz, huh? What would you know about that?\r\nPatrick: Plankton says he needs our artistic vision.\r\nSpongeBob: Let's show him\r\nSquidward: You buffoons wouldn't know artistic vision if it hit you over the head. Now, where's the paintbrush?  I'll show you what artistic vision is all about. Start with light brush strokes.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Oh.\r\nSquidward: Yeah. Perfect.  Simpletons.\r\nPlankton: Amazing. I didn't have to trick the tall one.  My plan is falling right into place. With those three boobs preoccupied, stealing the formula will be a snap!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Plankton? All this hard work is making us thirsty. Do you think we can get--  --a drink?\r\nPlankton: Let me show you something, SpongeBob.  I sure wish I could offer you a cold drink for all your hard work. But alas, my pipes are rusted shut.\r\nSpongeBob: I see what you mean.\r\nPlankton: Yes. If only there was some way I could—Where'd he go?\r\nSpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la.\r\nPlankton: Secret formula, here I come.\r\nSpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.\r\nPlankton: Perfect. Huh?  No! No! No! It's all wrong! Don't you know a thing about art? Gimme that brush!  Yes, yes, and yes. Voila!\r\nSquidward: A log cabin?\r\nPlankton: Yeah, I think they're so cozy. Now that's what you call art.\r\nSquidward: Everyone's a critic.\r\nPlankton: I can't wait to see Krabs' face when he discovers that I've absconded with The secret Krabby Patty formula.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Plankton? What do you think of the new window? We got it from The Krusty Krab.\r\nPlankton: SpongeBob, how do you expect me to see out of a window that high?\r\nSpongeBob: I guess I hadn't thought about that.\r\nPatrick: I did.  Look, Plankton. It's the perfect height for your kind.\r\nPlankton: See, SpongeBob? Patrick's using the old noggin. He knows I'll actually want to see out the window.\r\nPatrick: Wait, you wanted to see out the window? Weird.\r\nPlankton: Can't you two do anything right?! I give you one simple task after another and-- Just forget it. It was foolish of me to think this plan would ever work when nothing else in my life is panned out. Telemarketing—life guarding—creative writing—all such bitter failures.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh. It's okay, little green—creature. Patrick and I are going to keep working on The Chum Bucket. until it's the most pizzazziest restaurant in Bikini Bottom.\r\nPlankton: Really?\r\nSpongeBob: And how. Come on, fellows. Let's do some interior decorating.\r\nSquidward: Oh. goodbye, paintbrush. Hello, antique fitting.\r\nPlankton: Well, that ought to keep them busy for a while.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hup, hup, hup, hup.\r\nPlankton: I just need to sneak past Krabs, and I'm home-free.  Where could that stingy crab be?  Still don't see him.  The safe! I'm in the clear, baby!  It's beautiful.  No, no tears. Not yet.  There's work to be done.  Ha-ha! At long last!  And the secret formula is—one bottle of molting lotion, take passport photo, get new safe travel size. This isn't the secret formula! It's a to do list!  Huh? What happened to The Krusty Krab? Huh? What happened to The Chum Bucket?!  Curses! This isn't what I meant by renovation.\r\nSpongeBob: I know. Isn't it great? It looks just like The Krusty Krab.\r\nMr. Krabs: It looks more like Plankton trying to steal me restaurant.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! You've returned from your vacation.\r\nMr. Krabs: And it's time for The Krusty Krab to return from its vacation.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!/Yay!\r\nMr. Krabs: And I bet you tried to steal this, too.\r\nPlankton: Well, steal is such a strong word.\r\nMr. Krabs: You don't really think I'd leave me secret formula behind when I go on vacation. do you?\r\nMr. Krabs and Plankton: Now stay away from me....\r\nPlankton: ...restaurant, bug. I think we've been through this one before. Allow me to do the honors.\r\nKaren: Oh. excellent job, genius. You really fixed the place up.\r\nPlankton: Don't nag me, Karen. I've had a long day.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yup, Squidward. you really outdid yourself for the new decor. Where did you get the fountain?\r\nSquidward: That, I sculpted out the concrete foundation of the Chum Bucket.\r\nMr. Krabs: And these metal decorations?\r\nSquidward: Those were all fabricated from The Chum Bucket walls.\r\nMr. Krabs: And the computer?\r\nSquidward: Oh, that's Plankton's wife.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, it looks great, lad. And it didn't cost me a dime.\r\nCustomer #1: Wow, $25 for a Krabby Patty? Rip off, dude. Not cool.\r\nMr. Krabs: But you're paying for enhanced ambiance—dude.\r\nCustomer #1: Well, that's true—it is pretty classy in here.

Today I'll be spinning a tale you won't soon forget.  It's called \"SpongeBob SquarePants Vs. The Patty Gadget\". Now, SpongeBob was workin', his eye on the grill, 'til he heard a sharp sound that gave him a chill.\r\nSpongeBob: What's going on? What could it mean?\r\nNarrator: Wow, it's a deep-fry patty cookin' machine.  And hiding behind it, who do we see? None other than Squidward and his bad face acne.\r\nSquidward: Hey!\r\nMr. Krabs: What's is this contraption you've hauled into me place?\r\nSquidward: A miracle, a marvel. It'll cook Krabby Patties at a fabulous pace.\r\nMr. Krabs: But how are the patties? I mean, how do they taste?\r\nSquidward: I'll let you try one. Shove this in your face.\r\nMr. Krabs: I have to admit, that patty was yummy, though it sits like a rock when it lands in me tummy. But I've got me a fry cook, and he's always on time.\r\nSquidward: Ah, but this gizmo is faster, and you won't pay it a dime.\r\nMr. Krabs: Your machine sounds delightful. But how much does it cost?\r\nSquidward: Hmm, just fire SpongeBob and tell him, \"Get lost.\"\r\nNarrator: The machine wanted his job to make SpongeBob quit. But SpongeBob didn't like it. No, not one bit. Pushing his grill, SpongeBob burst through the door.\r\nSpongeBob: I challenge your gadget. I declare patty war!\r\nNarrator: With three little words, Krabs started the show. Flag raised in the air, he cried...\r\nMr. Krabs: Ready, set, go...!\r\nNarrator: Quick as a flash, Squidward pulled the big lever, and sat back and watched feeling oh, so quite clever. SpongeBob, with spatula held tight in his fist, flung twenty patties, not a single one missed.\r\nThe crowd was impressed.\r\nSandy: Wow!\r\nNarrator: They cheered full of glee. All except Patrick, who had to go pee.\r\nNarrator: A noise and a clatter came from the machine, and out popped the patties in a burst of hot steam. The gadget was fast, its first batch completed, but SpongeBob yelled out...\r\nSpongeBob: I won't be defeated!\r\nNarrator: He took in some air. SpongeBob swelled his physique. And dozens of patties filled up his cheeks.  He strained and he sweated. He summoned his will, and shot Krabby Patties right onto the grill.\r\nSquidward: Not bad!\r\nNarrator: Yelled out Squidward.\r\nSquidward: A really good try. But let's see how you do against my machine set on high.\r\nSquidward: Ha, ha.\r\nNarrator: Sandy said...\r\nSandy: What a schnook.\r\nNarrator: But SpongeBob cried out...\r\nSpongeBob: I won't lose to that thing!\r\nNarrator: Then he held up two spatulas and leapt like a spring. His hands were a blur, the patties went flying. He fried up a hundred without even trying. Squidward was worried. SpongeBob couldn't be beat.\r\nSquidward: I got one last chance, I'll turn up the heat.\r\nNarrator: He struggled and strained 'til his face turned dark blue. Then the lever moved forward and broke right in two. The gadget buckled and sparked. It cracked like a gun. So Squidward took off, yelling...\r\nSquidward: Let me know if I've won!\r\nNarrator: Lightning flew from its maw. It looked ready to burst. But SpongeBob, still standing, yelled...\r\nSpongeBob: Foul beast, do your worst!\r\nNarrator: The patties came flying, by twos and by threes, by dozens, by hundreds, oh, it was something to see. Aye, that machine, it was fast, but SpongeBob was faster. He proved to that thing that he was its master.  The gadget blew into bits and died with a boom. The blast was so loud, it woke King Neptune.\r\nKing Neptune: What was that?\r\nNarrator: It was all over, finished and done. With his head held up high, SpongeBob knew he had won. The crowd yelled, \"Hooray, Squidward's name is now mud!\" But as they were cheering, SpongeBob fell with a thud.  The service was short, tears shed with regret. Squidward, it seemed, was the one most upset.\r\nSpongeBob: Whoo, yeah!\r\nNarrator: What's that? You thought SpongeBob was buried down there? They just buried the gadget. Ha-ha, this I swear.  Well, that ends me tale, straight from the book.

Come here... see that? That's where the trophy's going.\r\nSpongeBob: You built us a trophy case for when we win?  Oh, you are a true friend.\r\nSquidward: no, you twits.

There's more. When I read it to the class, they pelted me with dodgeballs! Just because we were playing dodgeball!  Whyyyyyy?!\r\nSpongeBob: You can play your records later, Gary. Patrick, is that why you've been having trouble writing?\r\nPatrick: I'm worried my poem's not gonna be any good and you're going to hit me with dodgeballs.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I don't even own a dodgeball. Do you, Gary?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nPatrick: If you're serious, I can do this. I'm even gonna use my brain.\r\nSpongeBob: That's the spirit, Patrick!

I miss Sandy so much. Her tentacles,  the way she plays clarinet, her massive nose.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, that's Squidward.  He's not gone, he's right here.\r\nSquidward: No, I'm not.\r\nSpongeBob: I sure do miss that squirrel.  Her karate chopping,  that ten-gallon glass dome over her dome. And who can forget those buck teeth?  After Sandy gets back, we're gonna let her know just how much we miss her.\r\nPatrick: Is Sandy the one I call Mom?\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's your mother. But that does give me an idea. We'll throw Sandy the mother of all welcome home parties! Patrick, to the treedome!\r\nPatrick: Wa-hey!\r\nSpongeBob: Ah.  Huh?  We've readied this place for Sandy's arrival, which should be about...  ...Whoo, right now.  Welcome home, Sandy, you know that we missed ya.\r\nNat Peterson: No!  No one wants to hear you sing!\r\nSandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, he's got a fierce no-singing policy.\r\nSpongeBob: That's quite alright, Miss Cheeks. As long you don't have a fierce no-partying policy.  First, cake, then we'll karate-chop, and then...\r\nSandy: Wow, guys. You two, uh...  Really know how to, uh..  Throw a party.\r\nSpongeBob: I knew it! You have been itching to see us.\r\nSandy: Well, something's making my skin crawl.\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe a slice of cake will take your mind off of your crawling hide.

Tasty, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Are you okay, Sandy?\r\nSandy: I'm fine! My skin just hasn't adjusted to this here underwater air.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh.. Hey, Sandy. Sandy.  Surprise!  Patrick and I chipped in and got ya' a little somethin' somethin'.\r\nSandy: Aww, guys, you shouldn't have.  A new itch board? I mean, a new snowboard? Boy, I sure can't wait to scratch this down chafe mountain.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't you mean ride this down Scab Mountain?\r\nSandy: Thank you very rawness, SpongeBob and Pat.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, you're welcome, Sandy.

I'm ashamed to say this, SpongeBob, but while I was in Texas, I seem to have picked up a flea.\r\nSpongeBob: What's a flea?\r\nSandy: A flea is a dastardly little vermin that bites us air breathers. But this here flea collar will send the critter a-runnin'.\r\nSpongeBob: He tickles! Oh, this isn't so bad!  Ow!  He bit me! Got any more of those fancy collars, Sandy?\r\nSandy: No, but you can use this one right quick.\r\nPatrick: Ow! Ah, Ooh, ow, ooh, ah, yah, aah.  Connect the dots.  I drawed a horsey.  Ouch! Why does this flea keep biting me?\r\nSandy: 'Cause he's hungry. When a flea bites you, it's 'cause he's sucking up your blood for nutrition.\r\nPatrick: I've been bit by a vampire flea!  No!  I'm gonna turn into a vampire now!  It's already happening! Ah, ah!\r\nSandy: Patrick,  there ain't no such thing as vampires.\r\nPatrick: Augh! Doesn't matter!  Oh, this itch is killing me.

Are you okay?\r\nSandy: Them varmints is tough. They're from Texas, phew!\r\nPatrick: It's gonna be all right.  We will help you.  Okay, you know what? None of this would have happened if you didn't come back with your infestation! All you've brought us is fleas, and trouble and pain and itching and a rash. And pain and fleas and itching and... pain. So... much... pain!! So much pain.  And as for you. If you hadn't thrown this party, we wouldn't be in this mess.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute.

What does that prove?! If were gonna get out of this, we gotta work together.\r\nPatrick: You're right. I have an idea. SpongeBob, you get on Sandy's shoulders.  Uh-huh. Good. Now, I'll get on top of you!  Ah...  Ahhh... Much better.  Whoa!\r\nSandy: I do not play games.  Quick! In the tree house. It's the only safe place left.  We should be protected here.  Hold on!\r\nSpongeBob: Is this how we will spend the rest of our lives? Living in fleas instead of water?\r\nSandy: SpongeBob! That's It.

Well, you'll be shipped off to some other restaurant somewhere far away from here! Uh details are kinda hazy, but I packed your bags and your bus leaves in five minutes!

What's this? Owners manual!? Looks like I found my escape route!  Ow!\r\nLRH: For centuries, we Atlanteans spent, nay, wasted our talents and energy building the most sophisticated weaponry to defend ourselves from invaders. But we abandoned the idea of warfare long ago and now all these weapons gather dust behind this locked door as an example of what must be done if one wishes to live in harmony with all creatures of this, or any, world.\r\nMr. Krabs: Eh, harmony shmarmony. When do we get to see the treasure?!\r\nLRH: But of course, follow me.\r\nMr. Krabs: Comin' through, boys!\r\nPlankton: These Atlanteans leave a room full of the most advanced weaponry unguarded?

I give you the Atlantean Hall of Science.\r\nSandy: Hoppin' acorns. Look at all this high tech gear!  What does this gizmo do?\r\nLRH: It's a biomass converting device.

Behold, this grand machine allows the user to shrink down to nano-stature, enabling them to battle germs hand to hand.\r\nSandy: How's it work?\r\nLRH: Please have a seat and I'll show you.

Most folks don't stay with the tour this long. Of course you can. First, remember this. This bubble is over one million years old. It was brought here when the first Atlanteans colonized this place. Deftly hand carried over billions of light years from our home planet. It is our people's most beloved and treasured ancient relic. But most importantly remember to have fun!\r\nSpongeBob: There it is Patrick!\r\nBoth: The World's Oldest Living Bubble!\r\nSpongeBob: Look at it, Patrick! So ancient, so floaty.

The tour ran a little long. So, how are you all enjoying our beloved city?\r\nSquidward: I'm never leaving this place.

I'm talking to you, gramma!  Now I suppose all of you are wondering how I got this black eye.\r\nSquidward: Not really.\r\nSpongeBob: All right, who said that?! Was it you, gramma?\r\n{{L|\r\nSquidward: It was me, I said it.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, folks, I don't happen to see it as a shiner so much as a shining trophy of my glorious triumph over the forces of evil. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Who in the name of Neptune would want to tangle with a guy like SpongeBob SquarePants? Well, I'll tell you who.  It was a peaceful morning in Bikini Bottom. I emerged from my fruit-shaped bungalow fresh as a bee when a wanted cry of distress pounded against my eardrum.\r\nHarold: Hold it. Sponges don't have eardrums.\r\nMr. Krabs: He's right.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, let's save all the questions until the end! As I was saying... I quickly located the source of the cry which was a victim tied at my feet.  \"Don't worry, I'll save you.\" I assured... when a large bowling pin struck me in the face. The hurler was none other than Jack M. Crazyfish. And I could tell by that cold sore on his lip that today he meant business. With cat-like reflexes, I preempted his attack. But the scoundrel had me sabotaged. And I fell face down on a pile of extra large staples. He lunged at me, but I got him in the ribs with my novelty feather duster. Down he fell like a mighty oak.  And there he lay. The very thought of being vanquished made Jack M. Crazyfish burst into tears.  The force of his crying was so strong, I had to take evasive action. But one of the blasts went haywire and hit me right in the face...  ...and that's how I got this black eye and gave Jack M. Crazyfish a whomping of a lifetime. Whoo...football!\r\nDale: Uh, what did you say he looked like again?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, kind of tall, handlebar mustache...\r\nDale: Little green hat?\r\nSpongeBob: I kind of thought it was teal, but that sounds like him all right. Wait a second, how did you know he was wearing a green hat?  He's... real...\r\nJack M. Crazyfish: I'm looking for SpongeBob Squ--\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Crazyfish, please don't skin me alive! I made all that stuff up. I was just kidding about whomping you, right folks? You remember.\r\nGramma: I liked the part where you told us where how he was crying like a baby.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Gary.  All right, look. I had a toothpaste tube, like this. But I couldn't get it open 'cause the cap was stuck. And I guess... I haven't been working my arms out that much lately. And I opened it up like this...  Then I was walkin', like this.  And I didn't see where the cap went, like this.  So, I slipped on it and I landed right on my wrench, like this. And I gave myself a black eye, like this.  Uh... like these.  So you see? I made it all up so I could keep from looking stupid. Makes sense, doesn't it?\r\nJack M. Crazyfish: Uh, not really. I'm here because I heard you make a really good Krabby Patty.\r\nSpongeBob: One super hot and delicious custom order Krabby Patty with extra sauce, my lord. Served directly to your waiting  Head and neck area. Sir, please, I am so sorry.\r\nJack M.Crazyfish: Where I’m from, sorry don’t cut it.

I didn't know you had a famous relative.\r\nPatrick: Well the best part about it is, I don't have to accomplish anything in life, because my Uncle already did it for me. Really takes the old pressure off.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's nothing! My Great-Great Grandpappy Krabs invented the greatest thing since loose change! The spendthrift billfold system! Allow me to demonstrate.  Hey SpongeBob, how about a raise?\r\nSpongeBob: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: A-a-a watch.  See?\r\nSpongeBob: Doesn't that hurt?\r\nMr. Krabs: Every time!\r\nSpongeBob: Gosh, I don't have anyone famous in my family.\r\nPatrick: Oh, well then it's lucky you have me as a famous friend. Or your life would be a hollow shell.\r\nSpongeBob: I'll bet you're someone's famous poop-covered ancestor.  I never realized how sad and empty my life was, until my friends pointed it out.\r\nSandy: HI-YAH!\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Sandy.\r\nSandy: Something wrong, SpongeBob? You look sadder than a bullfrog full of sody-pop.\r\nSpongeBob: Do you have any famous relatives, Sandy?\r\nSandy: I sure do! My great aunt Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil. At Spindletop, Texas.\r\nVoice: She's ready to blow!\r\nSpongeBob: Seems like everybody in town has a famous relative. Everybody except me.\r\nSandy: Come on, I'll bet y'all got someone famous in your family tree.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, there was my uncle Sherm.  He could stick an entire watermelon up his nose.\r\nSandy: That's not the kind of famous I mean. Come on. Lets do a little digging around your family tree.\r\nSandy: \"Family Histories of Bikini Bottom\". Let's see, SquareHead, SquareShirt, SquarePants, Hey, looky here!\r\nSpongeBob: Gasp!\r\nSandy: It's a statue of SpongeBuck SquarePants!\r\nSpongeBob: I've never even heard of him! He got his own statue?\r\nSandy: Says here he saved the entire town of Dead Eye Gulch, that's what Bikini Bottom was known as back in the old west days.  It was a town that lived under the tyranny of a nasty crook 'til a mysterious stranger came to town.\r\nSpongeBuck: Wow! The big city! Well, time to make my fortune.\r\nSandy: Back in them days, the whole place was run by that no-good galoot, Dead Eye!\r\nSpongeBuck: Shoo-Wee! This place sure is big and fancy-like! Gee, willigers! They got an ice cream parlor!  I'll take one scoop of vanilly ice cream, please.\r\nFish #4: You're new here, aren't you?\r\nSpongeBuck: Yep. I just got off from the train.\r\nFish #4: You don't say.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Business is good today!\r\nSpongeBuck: Howdy do, y'all?\r\nHopalong Tentacles: Great, another hayseed.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Charge him double for his drinks.\r\nSpongeBuck: Howdy, partner!  Pardon, but is this stool taken?\r\nFish #5: Yeah. Some fancy dude just sat in it.\r\nHopalong: What can I get you, stranger?\r\nSpongeBuck: Give me a shot of milk.\r\nHopalong: Milk?\r\nSpongeBuck: Two percent.\r\nHopalong: Think you can handle it?\r\nSpongeBuck: I drink this stuff every day. Over the lips and through the gums, look out tapeworm, here it comes! Get ready Tapey.  Aah,  Oh, yeah! Smooth.\r\nHopalong: Right.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: What brings you to Dead Eye Gulch, stranger?\r\nHopalong: Strange is right.\r\nSpongeBuck: The name's SpongeBuck. I left home to make my way here in the big city. I'm here for the job.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Wonderful! You're hired.  Hey everybody! Meet our new sheriff!\r\nSpongeBuck: Sheriff? I'm not here for the sheriff job. I'm here for the fry cook job.  Back home, I'm known for my rootin-tootin, never-pootin chili. The spiciest chili west of the old west farm.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: No offense, kid. But your chili tastes terrible.\r\nSpongeBuck: In a good way?\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: No, in a terrible way. Look, we already gave you the badge. And the law of the west says: no take backs!\r\nHopalong: Since when?\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Shshshshshsh! So that means, you're the new sheriff!\r\nSpongeBuck: What happened to the old sheriff?\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Uh, he's at Boot Hill.\r\nSpongeBuck: Gasp! And, why is he at boot hill?\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Because Old Dead Tree Hill was totally full.\r\nPecos Patrick: He's a' coming! Dead Eye's a' coming!\r\nCitizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Dead Eye?!\r\nKrabs and Hopalong: Dead Eye?!\r\nSpongeBuck: Who's Dead Eye?\r\nPecos Patrick: I'll tell you who Dead Eye is! But I shall do it through song. Maestro, if you please.  ♪Oh, Bikini Gulch was a purdy place with sweet water and blue sky.

I'm here for my... money, Krabs  .\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: What? How am I supposed to keep the deed to me saloon if you keep taking all me mortgage payments? I'm going broke, here!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: That's the idea!  I thought we were all clear on that.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah.\r\nDead Eye Plankton: I'll be back at high noon tomorrow for the deed!\r\nSpongeBuck: Hey! That's not your money!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: WHO SAID THAT?!  Well, last time I checked, this town was Dead Eye Gulch! Not Yokelburg!  Yokelburg...  Who are you anyway?\r\nSpongeBuck: I'm SpongeBuck, the new sheriff. Want some chili?\r\nDead Eye Plankton: Sheriff!  'Round these parts we call them coffin jockeys!\r\nSpongeBuck: Coffin jockeys!?  You didn't say anything about that!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: That must be a new record for running off a sheriff.\r\nSpongeBuck: Hope I haven't missed the first post. Whoa, girl!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: Where do you get these guys?  All right, kid. I'm going to make it simple for you. I'm a villain, got it?\r\nSpongeBuck: Uh huh.\r\nDead Eye Plankton: And this town ain't big enough for the both of us! Understand?\r\nSpongeBuck: Yep.\r\nDead Eye Plankton: So, vamoose! Or we're going to have to settle this western-style at high noon, savvy?\r\nSpongeBuck: Sounds great!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: You have no idea what I'm talking about?\r\nSpongeBuck: Nope.\r\nDead Eye Plankton: (sighs)  And stay out! Hey, only three seconds off my record!  What are you hayseeds looking at?

So long, old friend!\r\nCowbone #1: Hey, buddy, you better be careful. Heat does funny things to your head.\r\nSpongeBuck: It does?\r\nCowbone #2: Oh, don't listen to that guy, kid! He's looney!\r\nPecos Patrick: Oh, hey SpongeBuck! Those guys are a barrel of laughs, huh? But lazy! Anyway, you've got to get back and save the town, sheriff!\r\nSpongeBuck: I ain't no sheriff. Or fry cook or even coffin jockey, and I'm no match for Dead Eye Plankton! I'm nothing.\r\nPecos Patrick: Out west, a man gets right back up on his coffin and faces his problems with the help of his idiot sidekick friend! That's me!  Duhhh...\r\nSpongeBuck: I don't know,  Okay, okay! I'll do it! Just stop hurtin' me! Besides, you're right! It's time I stepped up and looked him in the eye! So, I'll go back to Dead Eye Gulch, whip Plankton, and save the town at high noon!\r\nPecos Patrick: Hop on, buddy!\r\nSpongeBuck: Thanks, idiot friend! But I don't know how we'll ever get back to Dead Eye Gulch by high noon.\r\nPecos Patrick: Don't worry. I got a short-cut. He-ya!\r\nPolene Puff: Why are we going so fast?\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: 'Cause without a sheriff, Dead Eye won't stop until he has the clothes off our backs!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: Great idea!  Okay, let's see,  personal possessions, clothes off your backs, that should about do it! Look, I'm just going to drop off all my new stuff at the bank. I'll be back at high noon to rub my victory in your face with a little dance. Uh huh, waa-waa! Uh huh, waa-waa!\r\nHopalong: I gotta admit, he's got skills.\r\nDead Eye Plankton: That's right! And when I take the deed to your saloon, Krabs, I'll own every building in town! And you'll all have to work for me the rest of your miserable lives!  Swallowed a bug! I hate that. It totally ruins an evil laugh. Yee-how!\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: So, that's it.\r\nPolene Puff: We lost.\r\nHopalong: I don't know how it could get any worse.\r\nSpongeBuck: Hi, guys! I'm back in the nick of time!\r\nPecos Patrick: We're heroes!\r\nHopalong: You're morons!\r\nPolene Puff: It's too late. Plankton's taken everything!\r\nSpongeBuck: But it's only 11:55. The final showdown always takes place at high noon.\r\nPolene Puff: Well, I guess the early bird gets the worm.\r\nHopalong: And all our stuff.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: And me money! Me beautiful, beautiful money!\r\nSpongeBuck: You can't give up! Before I came here, I would've given up, too. But in the short 20 minutes I've known you, I've come to love Dead Eye Gulch.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Could you get to the point? We're freezing!\r\nSpongeBuck: What I'm a saying is if we all team up together, we can stand up to Dead Eye Plankton, and run him right out of Dead Eye Gulch for good! So, what do you say?\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Well, I think we all know the answer.\r\nAll: Forget it, SpongeBuck!\r\nPecos Patrick: Why are you all standing in your pajamas? No, don't tell me. Oh, I know! You're throwing a slumber party! Pillow fight!\r\nSpongeBuck: That pillow sure packs a wallop!\r\nPecos Patrick: It's made out of wood,  like all pillows in the old west. Round 2?\r\nSpongeBuck: I do believe I'd sit this one out.\r\nPecos Patrick: Looks like it's just you and me, kid.\r\nSpongeBuck: Come on, guys! We can do this! If we work together!\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: No offense, kid. But your advice is as terrible as your chili.\r\nSpongeBuck: I don't blame you for losing faith. I lost faith too. But then, I discovered the love of my new idiot friend. And we've come far. So I'm sure with all of us working together, in idiot friendship, we can beat Dead Eye and save the town! So let's huddle up and make a plan, together! Bzbzbzbzbzb\r\nPecos Patrick: Uh huh,\r\nSpongeBuck: Bzbzbzbzbzbzb\r\nPecos Patrick: Uh huh, uh huh,\r\nSpongeBuck: Bzbzbzbzbzbzbzbzb\r\nHopalong: Uh, SpongeBuck, why do you keep saying bzbzbzbzbzbzb?\r\nSpongeBuck: Umm...\r\nHopalong: You don't have a plan, do you?\r\nSpongeBuck: No. To be honest, I didn't think I'd get this far.  But I know we can beat him! If we just work together!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: Oh, I am terrified.\r\nAll: Dead Eye Plankton?!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: So, fry cook, you're back! And all alone.\r\nSpongeBuck: You wish, Dead Eye! We are united! Right g-- Hey!\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: We're right behind you, boy! WAY, WAY behind you!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: So, it's come to this. Mano y mano.\r\nSpongeBuck: Well, you can hold the mano, because it's come down to you and me!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: Well, well, well, look at the time! High noon!  Ow!  I hate all of you!\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Can I try?\r\nDead Eye Plankton: You can't do this!\r\nPecos Patrick: Three yee-haws for SpongeBuck!\r\nCitizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw! Yee-Haw!\r\nMr. Krabs: Step right up, folks! Just a dollar to stomp on old Dead Eye Plankton!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: Ah! Ouch! Ooh!\r\nPolene Puff: Take that, you no-good little varmint!\r\nDead Eye Plankton: I have a lot of money!\r\nPecos Patrick: Well, sheriff, you beat Dead Eye Plankton and saved the town.\r\nSpongeBuck: You forgot the most important part. I discovered the power of idiot friendship.\r\nPecos Patrick: Come with me, I want to show you something.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Thank you, sheriff SpongeBuck for saving our town. And for stepping on that little varmint.\r\nDead Eye Plankton: History will vindicate me!\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: We melted down Plankton's gold and made a statue in your honor.\r\nCitizens of Dead Eye Gulch: Oooh!\r\nHopalong: I liked my design better.\r\nWestern Mr. Krabs: Sorry about the whole “tricking you into being sheriff” thing. And to make it up to you, I've got a new badge for you. If you'll take it.\r\nSpongeBuck: Wow! Fry cook!  Thank you, good people of Bikini Gulch! The statue is truly amazing! Maybe a little too heavy in the hindquarters, but still, if I ever have a Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson, I'd want him to look at this and say 'Hey! I'm proud of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather!'\r\nCitizens of Bikini Gulch: Aaw!\r\nFish #8: Say seaweed!\r\nSpongeBob: So my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa SpongeBuck saved the town of Bikini Gulch! And everyone in it! I wonder what happened to the statue of my Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa.  It was much better than that one we have now.\r\nSandy: Yeah, and it's covered in jellyfish poop.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute,\r\nSandy: Gross! Don't touch that, SpongeBob! Eeew! What are you doing?!  That boy ain't hooked up right.\r\nSpongeBob: Look, Sandy!\r\nSandy: HUH?\r\nSpongeBob: SpongeBuck was here all along! Sorry, Great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandpa. I didn't recognize you all covered in poop.\r\nSandy: Wow!\r\nSpongeBob: I've got a lot to live up to. Maybe one day people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants!\r\nSandy: Keep dreaming, SpongeBob. Keep dreaming.\r\nSpongeBuck: Hey, everybody! It's good to be here at the Krusty Kantina! We got a real special show for y'all tonight! Featuring my new best pal, this guy!

They're sending out the wrong signals!\r\nSpongeBob: We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat.\r\nPatrick: You mean like those guys?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, just like those guys.   Best friend outfits like these really make a statement.\r\nPatrick: Look at these guys!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?\r\nBill: Oh, no, these aren't my friends. In fact, I hate just about everyone here, but my love for historical battles is so great, I join these losers every year to re-enact the battle of Bikini Bottom.\r\nSpongeBob: There was a battle of Bikini Bottom?\r\nPatrick: Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! A long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups  Those who spent all their time washing their hands like softies\r\nNathiel Waters: Clean as a whistle!\r\nPatrick: And those who had more important things to do with their time.\r\nColonial Patrick: That looks good to me.\r\nNathiel: That is truly disgusting!\r\nColonial Patrick: Oh, yeah?\r\nNathiel: You can't go around our town touching things with those filthy mitts!\r\nColonial Patrick: Oh, yeah?!\r\nNathiel: Yes!\r\nRed Group: Wash your hands!\r\nBlue Group: Never!\r\nPatrick: And that's how we won our right to wash as we please.\r\nBill: Oh, that's not what happened.\r\nSpongeBob: You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!\r\nPatrick: Never have, never will.\r\nSpongeBob: Echhh!\r\nPatrick: Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob?  They only had one ice cream cone.\r\nSpongeBob: That's ok. Thank you, friend.  So, anyway, I said...\r\nPatrick: Oh, wait. You've got something on your tongue.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?\r\nPatrick: Here, I'll get it.\r\nSpongeBob: Thank you.  Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me.\r\nPatrick: Well, then I guess we can't be friends.\r\nSpongeBob: What are you saying?\r\nPatrick: Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?  U... R... huh... How do you spell \"not my friend\"?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray.  Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you.\r\nPatrick: No, thank you.  I happen to like my various smells and germs.\r\nSpongeBob: But being clean is so much better.\r\nPatrick: Well, says you. I like dirty.\r\nSpongeBob: Clean!\r\nPatrick: Dirty!\r\nSpongeBob: Clean!\r\nHarold: Excuse us, but we have a battle to re-enact.\r\nSpongeBob: Fine, if that's how it is, then  I am joining the other side!\r\nPatrick: Fine, me too!\r\nHarold: Ah, come on! Let's go play somewhere else.\r\nSpongeBob: Ha! Got your nose!\r\nPatrick: Hey, give it back!\r\nSpongeBob: Not until you wash your hands!\r\nPatrick: Oh, yeah? Well  I got your eyeballs!\r\nSpongeBob: Eww, brain juice!\r\nPatrick: Do you give up yet?\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me.\r\nPatrick: Your pants are falling down.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?\r\nPatrick: I'll fix it.\r\nSpongeBob: Satisfied?\r\nPatrick: There, you look good now.\r\nSpongeBob: You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet.\r\nPatrick: Why, what's wrong with them?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll take care of it.\r\nPatrick: No! Not a pedicure!  No, no, not that, anything but tha-- Nail polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!\r\nSpongeBob: You, sir, could use some dental hygiene!\r\nPatrick: Who, me? My teeth are fine, see?\r\nSpongeBob: A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine.  You gotta brush in little circles!\r\nPatrick: Minty fresh! Taste pit, evildoer!!\r\nSpongeBob: You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of...this!\r\nPatrick: No! No, not...not deodorant!\r\nPatrick: My beautiful pit stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now.  It's booger time!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose.\r\nPatrick: Oh, yeah?\r\nSpongeBob: Booger!  Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold!\r\nMr. Krabs: Gold? Heehee!\r\nSquidward: Did you get any of Patrick's \"gold\"?\r\nMr. Krabs: He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for.\r\nPatrick: Ha! I got you now!\r\nSpongeBob: Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon!\r\nPatrick: Raw onions?!  That does it!  See this?\r\nSpongeBob: A Krabby Patty? What are you gonna do, eat it?\r\nPatrick: Oh, I'm not going to eat it.\r\nSpongeBob: No, not patty socks!\r\nPatrick: That's right, your precious patties on my stinky feet!\r\nSpongeBob: You better stop that!\r\nPatrick: Stinky, little feet!\r\nSpongeBob: You stop that right now!\r\nPatrick: Hopping...  ...Clams!  Hey, I got my filth back!\r\nSpongeBob: Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you!\r\nPatrick: No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!\r\nSpongeBob: Try me!\r\nPatrick: Stay back, I'll do it!\r\nSpongeBob: It's too late for that!\r\nPatrick: My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm covered in muck and scum!\r\nPatrick: Man, to get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!\r\nSpongeBob: It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need twenty baths a day!\r\nPatrick: Slather toe jam on my armpits?\r\nSpongeBob: I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!\r\nPatrick: Smear slime on my teeth?\r\nSpongeBob: And dry-clean my uvula!\r\nBoth: All right!\r\nSpongeBob: Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean.\r\nPatrick: And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, thank you.\r\nBoth: You're my best friend ever!\r\nBill: Hey, what's going on here? This battle isn't over until we have a winner.\r\nSpongeBob: Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Squeaky clean, squeaky, it's squeaky.\r\nSpongeBob: Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth.\r\nBill: Wow! I think the little yellow guy has taught us a valuable lesson.\r\nSpongeBob: And what is that, my son?\r\nBill: That re-enacting battles is really lame!  C'mon, guys, let's play something more manly, like football!\r\nHarold: Or hockey!\r\nThaddeus: Or knitting fluffy sweaters!\r\nSpongeBob: Come, Patrick, my work here is done.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`98\r\nWhat Ever Happened to SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Good morning, Gary!

How goes it?\r\nPatrick: Well, it was great until you showed up.\r\nSpongeBob: What's that?\r\nPatrick: Oh, just a birthday cake for my mom that I spent all day baking. Idiot Boy!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's the first time someone's called me that. Wait, I know who will enjoy my company.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward!\r\nSquidward: Don't you ever wake me up from my beauty sleep! Do you understand? Idiot Boy.\r\nSandy: It's all done! My greatest invention yet!\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy! What a neat robot!\r\nSandy: No!!\r\nSpongeBob: Let me explain. You see... I was passing by the tree, and I thought it'd be funny if I gave you a surprise.\r\nSandy: Oh, you gave me a surprise, alright. Look at the surprise I got!  Get out of here! Idiot Boy!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess that means there's only one place left to go. A place where I am wanted, wherever they like it or not!  SpongeBob WorkPants reporting for duty, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hurry up and get in there, boy! Patties need flipping.\r\nSpongeBob: No worries, captain!  Oops, well, all in a day's work. Now, back to doing what I do best! No way I can mess this up...\r\nMr. Krabs: Mr. Dollar, allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Dollar.  What the barnacles is going on?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs, are you okay?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm fine, as long as me money's okay.\r\nMr. Dollar: Although we've only known each other a short time, I want you to know... I love you.\r\nMr. Krabs: If I were you, I'd get as far away from me as possible-- Idiot Boy!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess that's it, then. If Mr. Krabs is calling me \"Idiot Boy\", it must be true, I know what must be done!  I somehow managed to make everyone mad at me. At least you still like me, right, Gare?\r\nSpongeBob: I'll miss you too, buddy. There's a year's supply of snail food for you.  Goodbye, pineapple.  Goodbye, Squidward. Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Sandy. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. Goodbye, life as I know it.  Welcome to Bikini Bottom. Population 538.  Minus 1.

That might cause a concussion.\r\nSandy: Patrick, where's SpongeBob?\r\nPatrick: I don't know. I've been knocking on his door for three hours. I need his hot sauce for my milkshake.\r\nSandy: We ain't got time for that. Hi-yah!\r\nGary: Mrloooow.\r\nSandy: Gary? Where are you, little guy?\r\nGary: Mrloooow.\r\nSandy: Gary? Gary?\r\nGary: Mrloow.\r\nSandy: Gary! What happened to you?\r\nGary: Mrlooooooowrooowroowrooow.\r\nSandy: A note.  To whom it may concern: if you found this letter, that means Gary's food bowl is empty and that it needs to be refilled. It also means it's been approximately one year since I've split town, and no one's noticed 'til now. No one needs to worry, I won't bother anyone again. Sincerely, SpongeBob. A.K.A. Idiot Boy.\r\nHarold: I could use this.\r\nJennifer-Millie: Yeah, I like these here.\r\nHarold: This is top quality.\r\nSpongeBob: Hello there.  What's going on?\r\nHarold: Oh, we thought you were taking a dirt nap, but we organized your clothes for you... SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Are you talking to me?\r\nHarold: Isn't this your name?\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know, is it?\r\nHarold: You don't know your name?\r\nSpongeBob: All I know is that I hit my head on some rocks! Now I can't seem to remember anything.\r\nHarold: Err, well, then I'll remind you that these are not your clothes, and your name isn't SpongeBob, it's, umm... it's... CheeseHead BrownPants. Ha ha! That's it!\r\nSpongeBob: CheeseHead, huh?  Wait a minute, what's this?\r\nHarold: Bubbles?!\r\nCheeseHead: I wonder what got into them?\r\nPerch Perkins: We interrupt this program for an important announcement.  Bikini Bottom is literally in a state of total chaos tonight.\r\nMuscular Guy: Literally!\r\nPerch Perkins: We go now to news scene chopper 7. What's up?\r\nNews Chopper: Not looking too good out here, Perch. The Krusty Krab is about to come apart of the hinges. Customers are in a rage over not getting their Krabby Patties.\r\nMr. Krabs: Squidward, where the barnacles is SpongeBob? This place is going down the toilet! Patties need flipping!\r\nSquidward: If I knew, do you think I'd be standing here getting yelled at by a bunch of morons?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't talk back to your superior officer, you...\r\nSandy: Squidward! Mr. Krabs! Y'all seen SpongeBob?\r\nSquidward: I think we just went through this...\r\nMr. Krabs: What he means to say is, no, we haven't.\r\nSandy: Well, apparently, he's left Bikini Bottom, and he ain't coming back.\r\nMr. Krabs: Let me see that.  To whom that may concern, if you found this letter, that means  sincerely... AKA...AKA? Idiot Boy? IDIOT BOY?! It is SpongeBob! What am I gonna do without me fry cook?!\r\nPatrick: What am I gonna do without my best friend?! I should never have been mean to you!\r\nSandy: I should have never kicked you out of my house!\r\nSquidward: If I knew that was the last time I've seen SpongeBob--  I would have slammed the door in his face even harder!\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, group meeting. Everybody out! The Krusty Krab's closed until further notice!  Now...  how do you propose we find me money-making employee?\r\nCheeseHead: Whoo, I live in a dump!\r\nFish: Hey, watch where your stepping!\r\nCheeseHead: Sorry, sir, I was just-\r\nFish: I know what you was doing. You was doing the old \"bump into the sucker and reach into his pockets and take his change\" routine, but it ain't gonna work this time. You want money? Get a job, you deadbeat!\r\nCheeseHead: I'm a jobless deadbeat? What a sad existence I don't remember I live.  Ooh, seems like I'm running on empty.  Not a penny to my name. Well, I guess if I want to fill the hole in my gut, I'll need to fill a job somewhere.  Help wanted?\r\nLisa: Well, Mr... BrownPants... you seem to have left this entire application blank.\r\nCheeseHead: I can't remember a thing.\r\nLisa: Well, do you have any special skills?\r\nCheeseHead: Special skills... oh, I can do this!\r\nLisa: Oh, what do you think you're doing?!  Sorry, sir, but we run a respectable business here!\r\nCheeseHead: Okay, I guess they don't want you blowing bubbles, unless it directly relates to the job at hand.  Thanks for the job, boss! You won't be disappointed.\r\nBuilder: That's real sweet, BrownPants, but I don't hear that hammer pounding.\r\nCheeseHead: Then this might be music to your ears.\r\nBuilder: Neptune's son, what are you doing?  You aren't doing that on my building site! You're fired!\r\nCheeseHead: I do not understand this. What is wrong with this city? Maybe it's not the city. Maybe it's me.  Hey, mister, Look at me! Mister, look at me! Is there something wrong with me?\r\nSandy: Listen up, y'all! I got a plan to bring back SpongeBob.\r\nMr. Krabs: You do?\r\nSandy: Yup, and it involves this.  It'll track any sponge within a 50-mile radius.\r\nSquidward: So, you're saying this thing can actually find SpongeBob?\r\nSandy: You got it, SquidCakes, but it's gonna take all of us to find--\r\nSquidward: Oops, I dropped it.\r\nMr. Krabs: MR. SQUIDWARD!!! This device was me last chance to get this place back into ship shape! And since you destroyed it, I am ordering you to find SpongeBob!\r\nSquidward: I wouldn't seek out that twit for all the leotards of the sea.\r\nMr. Krabs: If you don't find him, you'll be out of a job forever.\r\nSquidward: Ha! Is that your version of a threat?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, don't forget your retirement gift.\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, I am not interested in any–  Is that a handcrafted jewel-encrusted ornamental egg? That'll complete my collection! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Not so fast! Bring back me number one fry cook first.\r\nFish: Real drag, isn't it? Having to stand around the fire for warmth every night?\r\nCheeseHead: Yeah.\r\nOther Fish: Heh, not for us... we're just waiting in line for a new video game.\r\nCheeseHead: I guess I am just a jobless deadbeat.  You guys mind if I bubble?\r\nFish: You can't do that here!!\r\nCheeseHead: But... bubbles will steady the ol' nerves. Watch.  See? Feeling better already.\r\nCheeseHead: What could possibly be wrong with practicing the bubble arts?  Seems like a harmless activity.\r\nBubble Poppin' Boys Leader: Do you have any...  I think we've made our point with the snapping!  As I was saying... do you have any idea who we are?\r\nCheeseHead: Um, wait... err, um... don't tell me, um...\r\nBubble Poppin' Boys Leader : Don't answer.  I'll show ya.  We call us the Bubble Poppin' Boys. And article one of our charter prohibits bubble blowing on our turf.  You see why we don't allow bubbles in our city?! Fortunately, we have ways of dealing with careless bubble blowers like you. Let's rough him up, boys!\r\nBubble Poppin' Boys Leader: Where'd he go?  After him!!\r\nCheeseHead: Ah, I'll be making this getaway in comfort.\r\nMan: You- you did it!  Do you realize what you've done?\r\nCheeseHead: No.\r\nMan: You have freed the city. Citzens of New Kelp, come out of the shadows, 'cause CheeseBoy kicked the Bubble Poppin' gang right out of town!\r\nAll: Thank you, CheeseBoy!\r\nMan #2: What an amazing gift CheeseBoy has given us.\r\nCheeseHead: Actually, it's CheeseHead.\r\nMayor: Well, CheeseHead, this is a historic day for New Kelp City. You have rid this city of the Bubble Poppin' Boys, and restored bubble-blowing to the streets.  Something I wasn't able to do for 20 years as mayor. For this, I appoint you...  mayor of New Kelp City!\r\nAll: All hail mayor CheeseHead!!\r\nSandy: SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob!\r\nSandy: SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: Buddy? You there?\r\nSandy: SpongeBob!  Maybe someone at that truck stop has seen our porous little buddy.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob!\r\nSandy: There he is, guys!\r\nPatrick: Huh? SpongeBob!  Oh, I knew I'd find you, buddy! Look at you. You haven't changed a bit. Let's go home and eat a gallon of seanut butter.\r\nSandy: That's not SpongeBob, Patrick.  here's SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: I'll get ya out of this cage, buddy!  You're safe now in my arms.  Huh? Where'd you go now?\r\nSandy: Uh, Pat? All the ink came off on your belly.\r\nPatrick: Oh.\r\nSandy: Now let's see what that little critter's up to.  New mayor of...  SpongeBob's mayor of New Kelp City!\r\nMayor CheeseHead: Citizens of New Kelp City. I don't know much about politics or balanced budgets or how to be a \"leader\". I'm not exactly sure what a mayor is, but I do know this, while I am wearing the mayor's hat, it will always be safe to blow bubbles on the streets of new kelp or my name isn't CheeseHead BrownPants.\r\nSandy: CheeseHead BrownPants?\r\nMan #3: New Kelp City has brown-pants mania.\r\nSandy: Hang on a minute. I don't mean to put a damper on the mood here, but Bikini Bottom needs you back, SpongeBob.\r\nMayor CheeseHead: What's that?\r\nSandy: Well, I'm sorry I yelled at you, buddy.\r\nMayor CheeseHead: Oh, this is a surprise.\r\nSandy: Surprised I found you?\r\nMayor CheeseHead: No, surprised at seeing a talking weasel.\r\nSandy: It's me, Sandy. Don't pretend you don't remember me, SpongeBob.\r\nMayor CheeseHead: Sorry, Sandy. But I'd probably remember another underwater, talking weasel.\r\nPatrick: You may not remember the weasel, but you haven't forgotten your best friend, have you?\r\nMayor CheeseHead: I have no idea how that got there. All I remember is hitting my head, blowing some bubbles and now, poof, I'm mayor.\r\nSandy: You must've lost your memory when you hit your head. You'll just have to come back with us to Bikini Bottom. The familiar surroundings will bring your memory right back.\r\nMayor CheeseHead: Uh, sorry, weasel girl, I can't leave. These people need my leadership. In fact, I'm late for a meeting.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, wait!\r\nSquidward: Don't just stand there, get in.\r\nSandy: Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Hurry up!  Decorative egg, here I come.\r\nSandy: Here it is! You must recognize this place.\r\nMayor CheeseHead: Nope.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't recognize the Krusty Krab? Stop your kidding, boy. And start frying up them patties.\r\nMayor CheeseHead: I was a fry cook before?\r\nMr. Krabs: Aye, the best in the business. Now get flipping.\r\nMator CheeseHead: Look, guys, as much as I'd love to toil the days away flipping burgers, I think I'll just go back to my modest job as mayor of a major city.\r\nSquidward: Whoo-hoo-hoo, SpongeBob's leaving for real this time!  Mr. Krabs, I brought back your number one fry cook. You gotta pay up.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, Mr. Squidward, a deal's a deal. Here's your fancy egg.\r\nSquidward: Ohh It's BEAU-TI-FUL!  STOOOOOP!\r\nSandy: You okay, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, just a bit of a headache, Sand-  Hey, I remember this place.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob's back!\r\nMr. Krabs: We're really sorry we ran you out of town, boy. But we're glad you're back.\r\nSpongeBob: I'd really love to stay, but the people of New Kelp City need their mayor. Goodbye, everyone.\r\nPatrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs: Huh? / What? / Oh, not again.\r\nSquidward: He's leaving, again!\r\nPerch Perkins: Stop what you're doing and don't go out that door.  This is a KNKC special report. Panic in the streets of New Kelp City as rampant bubbles bring visibility down to 0. The angry citizens here blame the apocalyptic scene on Mayor CheeseHead BrownPants and his newly-enacted bubble policy.\r\nConstruction Fish: If I ever see Mayor Brown Pants again I'm gonna grab his little, yellow head and literally rip his!--\r\nMr. Krabs: Where's SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Order up!  Who wants to be a dumb old mayor when you're the best fry cook in town? And how could I ever leave behind my bestest friend?\r\nPatrick: Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, Krabby Patty!  SpongeBob, another masterpiece.\r\nSandy: It's great to have you back, Spongy.\r\nSpongeBob: Looks like I'm back in Bikini Bottom forever.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`99a\r\nThe Two Faces of Squidward\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: ♪Squidward had a Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty.

But if I were to craft another in a different size,  the dimension of the hollow center multiplied by the number of holes may offer another tune, one that could soothe those jellyfish.

Lovely.\r\nSquilliam: Isn't it?\r\nNick: Well, I have to say Squilliam, and I think that I'm speaking for all of our viewers out there when I say this. You, are truly a fancy man.\r\nSquilliam: Well, of all this gushing perfectly deserved.  And now, I'd like to present to you my most favorite room, in the house  It's all custom. Ah, look at this, it's my jewel-encrusted toilet paper holder.\r\nNick: Such class!\r\nSquilliam: Come, let me show you the roof!\r\nNick: An elevator?\r\nSquilliam: Watch your step.  This may take a while. Just sit back and relax.\r\nNick: What the!? A whirl pool bath elevator?\r\nSquilliam: I brought some soap.  All ashore. Welcome, to my roof top garden! Romantic grotto, sparkling berry mineral soda waterfall, and my personal favorite, a 130-foot-long sculpture of my unibrow!\r\nNick: It's huge, and... lifelike!\r\nSquilliam: If you look closely, you'll notice that it's made entirely out of gilded door knobs.\r\nNick: You have the fanciest...\r\nSquilliam: What?\r\nNick: You have the fanciest...\r\nSquilliam: I have the fanciest ring?\r\nNick: No, your phone is ringing.\r\nSquilliam: Oh.

Hello.\r\nSquidward: Hello, my name is Squidward Tentacles, and my house is far fancier than that slob Squilliam's!\r\nNick: Really?\r\nSquidward: Really!\r\nNick: Okay, we'll be at your house in two hours with a camera crew.\r\nSquidward: Two hours? But I haven't even got time to wash my hair.  There's a stain on the rug! I'll just use this chair to hide it. There we go. Now I'll just...  There's a hideous hole in the wall! I'll just use this painting to cover it up. Perfect.  Oh no!  I'll never get this place in shape in time!  SpongeBob! How long have you been spying on me?\r\nSpongeBob: Umm... What day is it?\r\nSquidward: It's the day you go away, and never come back.\r\nSpongeBob: But, Squidward, if I do that, then how am I going to help you get your house ready for the big TV show?\r\nSquidward: How'd you know about that?\r\nSpongeBob: I was spying on you.\r\nSquidward: Do you want me to get the cops down here again? Because...  All right, fine. But one slip up, and you are out of here. Comprendo?\r\nSpongeBob: Mucho comprendo, Señor Habanero!\r\nSquidward: All right, first of all, I'm going to give you something so simple, that a person without a brain could even get it done right.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, that's good, because I lent my brain to Patrick for the weekend.\r\nSquidward: Really?\r\nSpongeBob: No, not really... He traded me these two chocolate bars for it.\r\nSquidward: I don't care! Just use this paint to cover up that faded spot on the wall right there. Don't touch anything else!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, what was that noise?  Skin me alive and drench me in boiling oil! What have you done to my living room? I told you just to paint the faded spot.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it all looked kinda faded.\r\nSquidward: Never mind! Maybe it won't show up on camera. Here, help me move this sofa.\r\nSpongeBob: You got it, Squiddy. Where are we moving her to?\r\nSquidward: Hang on, I'm trying to get the grip on the thing. Now don't move it until I say...  Ow! Okay, it's on my foot. Now don't...  Ow!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nSquidward: Ow! SpongeBob, I told you not to move it until I say...  Ow! Why do you keep moving it?\r\nSpongeBob: ‘Cause you keep saying “ow”!\r\nSquidward: I don't need you, I can move it myself.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, Squidward, you're so strong!  And you split your sofa in half! It'll be really easy to move now.\r\nSquidward: Oh no, they're already here! Go get a vacuum and clean up all the sofa bits. I've gotta run upstairs and dress my wound!\r\nSpongeBob: Roger!  Okay, Squidward, found the vacuum! Squidward? Well, I'll just vacuum for him. Hmm, Squidward's house is really messy. I'm going to need some extra power.\r\nSquidward: Okay, SpongeBob, I finished... What the?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward! I'll turn it off.\r\nSquidward: Come out of there.  Uh, hang on please.  Please, just one more minute Nick!\r\nPatrick: Who's Nick? Sorry, Squidward. I couldn't wait any longer, I've gotta use your toilet. No questions! Thanks.  Phew! I wouldn't go in there for a couple days. Or weeks.\r\nToilet: Please, please, somebody put me out of my misery!  Have mercy on my soul...!\r\nPatrick: Oh, hey, Squidward, if you see SpongeBob, can you give him his brain back? I was borrowing it for the weekend. I'll just set it here.  See ya!\r\nSpongeBob: Thank you, Patrick!\r\nSquidward: Oh no!\r\nNick: Hello, and welcome back to House Fancy. We're arriving at the home of Mr. Squidward Tentacles, who claims his house is far more fancier than that of Squilliam Fancyson. Let's take a look.  Well, I, I, I, well, I don't know how to say this...\r\nSquilliam: Go ahead, say it.\r\nNick: Squidward Tentacles, you seem to have ushered in an entire new era in house fanciness!\r\nSquilliam: Huh?\r\nSquidward: I have-... I have?\r\nNick: What you have done here hearkens back to the illustrious post-primitive movement popularized by famous designer Saul Limpkins. Say, was he a big inspiration for you?\r\nSquidward: Why, yes. I've studied him for... years!\r\nNick: I would like to announce, that Squidward's house will be featured in an hour long, commercial free House Fancy special, and Squidward will be crowned House Fancy prince, of the year! An honor which, was originally to be bestowed on Squilliam, but now isn't.\r\nSquidward: Yay!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, don't worry, Squilliam, I might be able to get Squidward to help redecorate your house. He is a personal friend of mine. You know success hasn't gone to his head? He is still the same old great guy, he has not changed.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`101b\r\nKrabby Road\r\nFrank: …and this is the maximum level.

It was a cargo ship used to bring back exotic spices from faraway lands.\r\nSpongeBob: With two direct-action steam turbines producing 6,500 horsepower geared up to triple screws,  it'll get your spices where they need to go.\r\nMrs. Puff: Thank you again, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: It's working! She's noticing my vast of knowledge! I can now taste the sweet, sweet lamination of a fresh boating license.\r\nMrs. Puff: This, class, is the Lady Scallion.\r\nSpongeBob: ...named after the captain's strict diet of scallions, of which the crew complained and the captain's  odor strongly resembled.  For four years this brigantine explored distant lands discovering places unknown to anyone besides the people who already lived there.  You ready to give me that license yet, Mrs. Puff?\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, you're going to get it all right.\r\nSpongeBob: I knew it!\r\nMrs. Puff: Okay, this is the end of the tour. Anything to add, SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh boy, here it is! The main controls! Just look at all this stuff! There's the triple oscillator, and there's the hoist pulley, and there's the booby trap, and there's the long range mast knob, and there's a hot dog with extra mustard.  And there is the starter mechanism. That, right there.  A/C, hmmm...That's short for \"automatic conditionata\", and that's fancy fancy talk for \"Let's get this party started. Like, instantly!\"  Whew.  Man, I'm glad that's over. Oh, that's a nice touch, what a soothing projection screen.\r\nMrs. Puff: That's not a projection screen!  SpongeBob, stop it right now!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, ma’am.\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, sweet Poseidon. Move aside.  I gotta stop this ship before it plows into Bikini Bottom! Uh, uh, let's see. The first thing to turn off is the... Uh, oh, dear Neptune! I've never driven anything this advanced before.  SpongeBob, I hope you know what you were talking about, because it's up to you now.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay.\r\nMrs. Puff: We don't have much time. In a few minutes, we'll be flattening millions of innocent lives!\r\nSpongeBob: Innocent lives?!\r\nMrs. Puff: And you're the only one that can save them.\r\nSpongeBob: The only one...that can...save...them?!\r\nMrs. Puff: Yes! And what I want you to do  is ummm, tighten the gurneys, then survey the poop deck, and...\r\nSpongeBob: STOP!!! I know what to do.  I read a book. Chapter 1, batten down the hatches.  Next, lower anchor.  Oh no!  The anchor is stuck. I’m going to free it manually. I'll be right back.  Done and done. Thirdly, utter a hearty seaman's laugh.\r\nMrs. Puff: Oh, my gravy. He even knows the hearty laugh! He has been doing his homework!\r\nSpongeBob: And finally, the coup de grace. The only way to park the largest ship ever built,  is to perform the Reverse 7/20 Tail Spin.\r\nMrs. Puff: But that's never been attempted before.\r\nSpongeBob: You're right, it hasn't.  NOT UNTIL NOW.\r\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I don't know how,  but you did it. You saved us all. Let's get off this thing.  And the way you pulled the anchor out, genius! I never thought I'd say this, but here's your driver's license.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy! At long last!\r\nTugboat driver: What are you doing here?  No one should be on board while I’m tugging the museum into port.\r\nMrs. Puff: You mean, he's not driving this thing at all?\r\nTugboat driver: Heck, no!   Now, don't get so down, kid! Look, for your false bravery, I’m giving your honorary Sea Legs, okay? Come on, lemme buy you some ice cream.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh gosh.  Headlights are on!\r\nMrs. Puff & Tugboat driver: DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING, YOU TWIT!\r\nTugboat driver: RUUUUNNNN!!!!\r\nMrs. Puff: Good thing you studied.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`103a\r\nSpongicus\r\nSpongeBob: ♪Ooooooooo-oooooooohhh-woh-woooh, how much chum could a sea slug chug if a sea slug could chug...♪  Mr. Krabs, you gotta get out here!

I vow to introduce to this fair city, culture, in the form of hand to hand grappling!  I intend to enrich your lives culturally, by exhibiting the moist spectacle of gladiators in mortal conflict!  My corporate underwriters told me to mention that it's free!  Come one! Come all! Remember, kids love gladiators.\r\nDebbie: Wow, real-life conflict, for free!\r\nNathiel: Let the horror show begin!\r\nPlankton: Oh, Karen, even though you're just a frigid machine, your circuits must be welling up with emotion at my latest achievement.\r\nKaren: Oh, yes, my resisters are simply gushing from their copper foil traces.\r\nPlankton: This will prove to be my greatest evil scheme ever!\r\nKaren: That's what you said when you tried to boil Krabs in a giant bisque.\r\nPlankton: I can still feel the burns, which is why I removed all molten liquid from this maneuver. And it's why this time, I will be the one with all the customers. And Krabs will be the pathetic one, in an empty restaurant, stuck with a computer for a wife.  Uh, sorry, honey.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, looks like Plankton finally has some customers!\r\nMr. Krabs: I agree, it's very suspicious. And he may have lured a few of our fair-weather customers in with some cheap entertainment, but our loyal customers, know quality when they taste it! So let's get in there, and serve 'em up a burger they tell their grand-guppies about!  Where's all my loyal customers?\r\nSquidward: They've all taken their grand-guppies to see the guts and gore across the street.\r\nMr. Krabs: That lower life form can slender my name, and desecrate me mother's grave,\r\nMama Krabs: I'm right here!\r\nMr. Krabs: ... but when he steals me customers, then I push back!

And I'm going to sniff out the source.\r\nPlankton: Welcome one and all, to the first bi-annual big arena of annihilation!\r\nSpongeBob: Whoo!\r\nPlankton: Brought to you by yours truly.

It's fresh and warm, like my hospitality.\r\nSadie: Why, thank you.\r\nPlankton: Just ten dollars, please.\r\nSadie: Ten dollars? Why would I pay ten dollars, when I can go across the street and get a Krabby Patty for one dollar?\r\nMr. Krabs: Exactly!\r\nPlankton: You don't get this kind of entertainment with a Krabby Patty, do you?\r\nSadie: No, I suppose not.\r\nPlankton: Ten dollars, or the fight's off!\r\nSadie: Ah, fine, whatever.\r\nPlankton: Here you are. I'm sure I've made a satisfied customer of you all ready.\r\nSadie: That was appalling! What was in that?\r\nPlankton: Oh, just the usual ingredients. Some jellyfish squeezings, whale blubber, sea horse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust.\r\nSadie: Oh, barnacles. That's foul!\r\nPlankton: Now, I've been waiting for 20 years to have the amount of customers Krabs sees everyday! And I won't let that be ruined because the show's \"boring,\" or the food's \"inedible.\" So sit down, enjoy the show, and buy some chum!\r\nSpongeBob: What do we do now, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Don't worry, I'm all ready doing it.\r\nSpongeBob: NO!

Oh, silly me, I'm forgetting one more minor detail.  Oh, yeah. Is it getting hot in here?  Or is it just you?  Ah!  \"Two Krabby Patties. P.S., SpongeBob, you're an idiot. Love, Squidward.\" Aw, love you, too, Squiddy. Two Krabby Patties, coming right up!  Whoa!  Hmm.  Whew, this thing is stuck pretty good.  Whoa!  I guess this is it.  Oh, you really saved me!  Whoa! Hey, a splinter. Okay, well, it's been nice knowing you but you have got to go. Now. Okay, out we go.  Oh, that kinda' hurts. Come on. Ooh, that really hurts. Oh, barnacles, this hurts! Conch-shelled manatees, this is painful!   Okay, you're tough, you're smart, and you're charming, but you are still no match for me! Look! A bald eagle with a mustache!  Okay, fine, stay.

Don't move too much, it ruins it.\r\nSpongeBob: Ow. Ow. Ow. You're making this a little bit difficult. Luckily, I am ambidextrous!  Perfection!\r\nSquidward: I hear you!

Well, you see, this got stuck up there  so I stacked stuff and I climbed up to reach it. I reached the grip  and I got it but then I fell and I screamed! I was sure I was dead, but then I wasn't, but then I tripped and I got this splinter... Squidward? Squidward, were you listening at all?  I got this really bad splinter, you see?  And I couldn't hold the spatula with my hand so I used my nose.  Makes sense now, huh?\r\nSquidward: Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. You're a half-wit who injured himself at work being a nitwit.\r\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squiddy.\r\nSquidward: Injury. Your brain is injured!  Wait a minute.

Please, Squidward, you can't let this happen!  You can't let them force me away!\r\nSquidward: Sorry, the rules are the rules.  Yeah, it'll be pretty quiet around here with Mr. Krabs sending you home early and all. I just hope we'll make it through the whole rest of this day without you here.\r\nSpongeBob: Please, Squidward!

There you go Mr. Krabs. You always wanted to make \"big money.\"  Good deed accomplished! I ask for no reward.\r\nPatrick: You're a saint, SpongeBob! A saint!\r\nSpongeBob: I know, and it is a burden I must carry. But times a wasting! We need another good deed!\r\nPatrick: Oh, I got one! You know that thing?\r\nSpongeBob: Um, right, that thing that we did that day.\r\nPatrick: No, the other one.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob!  Hey! Look at what you did to me. You better fix my nose, or you'll hear from my lawyer!\r\nSpongeBob: Are you sure?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, you'd be ugly again.\r\nSquidward: Yes, I'm sure!\r\nSpongeBob: Hmm, how to fix his nose?\r\nPatrick: What, if you turn the bottle upside down, maybe it'll shrink it.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, that's brilliant!\r\nSquidward: No wait, don't.\r\nSpongeBob: That didn't work.\r\nPatrick: Try it again.\r\nSpongeBob: I think I'll just even him out. First, a bigger head.\r\nPatrick: Well, now his body is too small.\r\nSpongeBob: Right, too small.\r\nPatrick: Arms are too short.  Legs are too short.  Other arm.  Feet too small.  Teeth!  Belly button.  Perfect!\r\nSquidward: I look horrible!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Ew!  He inked!\r\nSquidward: Well, pardon my anatomy!  What's happening?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: All right!\r\nSquidward: What did you do to me?\r\nPatrick: I know! I know! Um, made you a monster!\r\nSpongeBob: And a giant.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: A giant monster!\r\nSquidward: I don't want to be a giant lumbering monster!  What will I do now?\r\nSpongeBob: That's easy, play giant lumbering monster tag!\r\nPatrick: Yeah! Yeah! You chase us!\r\nSpongeBob: And we run around and scream like crazy!

Maybe he's a nice monster, like in my story book.\r\nLifeguard: Oh right, I, I haven't thought of that. Well, are you?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, goodness gracious, yes. Squidward is the nicest giant of them all.\r\nPatrick: Yeah! Squidward, tell them about all those times that you didn't punch me in the face.\r\nSpongeBob: Even though you really wanted to.\r\nSquidward: Oh, quiet you morons!\r\nNazz: He hurt the little one's feelings.\r\nShubie: Why, that's not very nice at all.\r\nLifeguard yells: Take him down boys!\r\nSquidward: Ow!\r\nLifeguard: This oughta fix him.\r\nSquidward: Okay, okay, I'm nice.  Now will you leave me alone?\r\nSadie: Oh yeah? Then prove it!\r\nLifeguard: Yeah! Are you nice enough to... um...\r\nNazz: Compliment me on my new hairdo?\r\nSquidward: Yeah, sure, whatever.\r\nNazz: Oh, thank you.\r\nCamp Councilor: Let the junior guppies camp out under your toenails?\r\nSkier: Take me to the top of Mount Humongous?

Ahem?\r\nSquidward: What?\r\nEvelyn: He didn't say bless you.\r\nLifeguard: Get him!\r\nShubie: Where'd he go?\r\nLifeguard: Is that him over there?\r\nSquidward: Uhh, I'm a lamp post?\r\nLifeguard: Oh. Well, let's go check down by the creek! We'll teach him to dip his feet!\r\nSquidward: Well Squidward, I guess this is your new life.  And this is your new bed.  Good night, old life.  I'll miss you.\r\nSpongeBob: Good night, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: Where are you?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick and I are having a sleepover, in your belly button.\r\nSquidward: What the? Get out of there!  You two have ruined my life!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh Patrick, this is terrible! Squidward did not like the kindness we did him.\r\nPatrick: So?\r\nSpongeBob: We shall do him another.  We did it!\r\nSquidward: What the?\r\nSpongeBob: Since our last kindness didn't go so well, we brought you a new one.\r\nSquidward: A giant clarinet?  And it sounds divine!  Now I'm too small to play my giant clarinet!  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever played!  Well, at least I still have my kelp garden.  What?  You cut it down?\r\nSpongeBob: We used your kelp to make a kelp-mâché clarinet.\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`107b\r\nNo Nose Knows\r\nSquidward: I thought I told that kid not to put the organic sea cucumber on top of the free range anemones! Well at least my flowers survived the trip.  SpongeBob, would you please find your own flowers to sniff!\r\nSpongeBob: What about Patrick, does he have to find his own flowers too?\r\nSquidward: What are you taking about, nitwit? He doesn't even have a nose!\r\nPatrick: Of course I have a nose, Squidward. Why, it's as plain as the nose on my...  ...face?  You're right, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: My floors! Think fast, squiddy. I've got your nose.\r\nPatrick: You do?\r\nSquidward: Yeah I've got it...  ...right here.\r\nPatrick: Give me! Give it here!\r\nSquidward: If you want it, you gotta go get it.\r\nPatrick: There!  Well SpongeBob, what do you think of my new nose?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, that's not a nose that's a...  ...hermit crab.\r\nPatrick: I guess I'll always be a noseless freak.\r\nSpongeBob: It's not so ab-normal to be noseless. Just look around. Lots of fish don't have noses.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, but all my friends have noses. You, Squidward, Sandy, even Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: There ya are!\r\nSpongeBob: Well Patrick, if you're so concerned about not having a nose, why don't you just get a new one stitched on to your face.\r\nPatrick: I can do that?\r\nSurgeon: Well, what do you think?\r\nPatrick: Sorry doc, but I don't really think it's me.\r\nSurgeon: That's a-okay. That's cool. As the lead surgeon here, I take a hypophetical oath. Which means I will not stop, I will not rest, I will not cut a single toenail, until the customer is 100% satified! So please, browse our extensive wall of noses! And I will patiently await your final decision.\r\nPatrick: Okay! Let's see. Hmm\r\nSurgeon: Excellent choice!\r\nSpongeBob: All right Patrick, let's unveal the new shanauze!\r\nPatrick: Wait, stop, careful SpongeBob! This fragile stitching requires tender care. Allow me to carefully remove the bandages.\r\nSpongeBob: There it is, Patrick! Your brand new sniffer! Looking good buddy!  Well, I've gotta go to work now. Have fun with your new nose.\r\nPatrick: I will! Now, how do I use this thing?  What is that smell?  Pastries? I never knew they smelled so good!\r\nFred: Well, I guess I won't be eating those.\r\nSquidward: Let's see Patrick destroy these.\r\nPatrick: All these years I knew I was missing out on something, but I never thought smelling could be this good!  What is that horrible smell?  Onion rings?  The scent! Nobody told me about bad smells!  What is it now?  I'm going to have to re-think this whole smelling thing.  I made it. At least here at home, I can't be attacked by those wretched odors.  Bad smells are all around me!  I cannot live in these conditions!\r\nNarrator: 48 hours later...\r\nSpongeBob: Hiya Patrick. How... Whoa! Hey, looking good.\r\nPatrick: The smells! They're everywhere! It's unbearable!\r\nSquidward: What's wrong with the pin head?\r\nPatrick: There's another one! No! I can't take it!\r\nSquidward: Where do you think you're going?\r\nPatrick: To do what should have been done long ago. , then screams Sweet Neptune, imported cheese!  This is inexcusable!  Yuck!\r\nSquidward: What are you doing with my cheese?\r\nPatrick: It's rotten garbage now.  That's better.\r\nSquidward: That was my cheese. It's supposed to smell like that, kelp for brains!\r\nPatrick: You are sick, Squidward!  There's that smell again!\r\nSpongeBob: 1, 2, 3, 4  Come on SquarePants, be a man!\r\nPatrick: You!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, help!\r\nPatrick: Oh, I'll help you all right! Help stop you polluting are world with your sweaty holes.  There.\r\nSpongeBob: I can't work at the Krusty Krab looking like this. I'm out of uniform.\r\nPatrick: Well you can't go to work smelling like that. You should be thanking me, SpongeBob.  Smell's like, something greasy!  Nobody move! I am ridding this place of it's disgusting stench, with these scented candles!\r\nFred: My mouth can't take these conflicting flavors! Agh!\r\nPatrick: This air freshener should finish the job.\r\nMr. Krabs: What the barnacles do you think you're doing?! You're chasing away all me customers!\r\nPatrick: Well good! No one should have to eat in this stench!\r\nMr. Krabs: What? Why, I got a good mind to...\r\nPatrick: Say no more, you can thank me later. Right now, I've got plenty more stink holes to swab clean.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, that new honker of his has turned him into a complete jerk!\r\nSandy: Hiya Pat.\r\nPatrick: Take a bath, fleabag!\r\nMr. Krabs: I've asked you all here, because we all face a similar problem. The problem, a sea star with a nose that's gotten way out of hand.  Now what I want to know is, are we going to do something about it?\r\nSquidward: Let's give him what for.\r\nSandy: Let's hogtie him and run him out of town on a rail.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on SpongeBob, be a man!  Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Not now boy! We're in the middle of a public lishen! That no good, nose flartin...\r\nSpongeBob: It is not Patrick's fault!\r\nAll: Huh?\r\nSpongeBob: It's the new nose that has betrayed us. My grandma SquarePants always says, punish the nose, not the man. But we're going to need something foul, something beyond foul, a stench that will blow the socks off his fungus-infested socks!  Okay, this should be stinky enough. I've gathered every sweaty sock, moldy pizza, and rotten piece of fruit in Bikini Bottom.  With a little raw sewage for good measure.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ata' boy! Now for the moment of truth!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes sir!\r\nPatrick: Hello.  No!  All I wanted was to be able to smell like the rest of you.\r\nSpongeBob: Here lies the nose of Patrick Star. Rip.  Well this is terrible! All Patrick wanted was to be like the rest of us, and we punished him for it!\r\nSquidward: Who cares?

Plenty of folks would love to get a hold of that ingredient.\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir!  And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patties, secret ingredienty.  Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe?  What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  What are you doing lolly gagging about? Get back to work!\r\nSpongeBob: Right away, sir.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hop to it! There's a lot of hungry customers out there!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!\r\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me.\r\nPatrick: With what?\r\nSpongeBob: With this.\r\nPatrick: Here you go, buddy.\r\nSpongeBob: Not that kind of help. This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!\r\nPatrick: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!\r\nPatrick: Find out!\r\nSpongeBob: You and I are going to need to do a little detective work!\r\nPlankton: What are we eating this time, Karen?\r\nKaren: Something new.\r\nPlankton: Oh, you mean the \"secret recipe\" I came up with?\r\nSpongeBob: Aha! I knew it was you!\r\nPlankton: What was me?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!\r\nPlankton: Is this a joke?\r\nSpongeBob: Why don't you tell me. Is it?!\r\nPlankton: Uh, no.\r\nPatrick: A good one!\r\nSpongeBob: All right, no more jokes! Either you tell me where the secret ingredient is, or we'll be forced to use other means of making you talk!\r\nPlankton: Sorry, I really have nothing for you.\r\nSpongeBob: Then how do you explain this?\r\nPlankton: Okay, you caught me.\r\nSpongeBob: And so the truth floweth forth.\r\nPlankton: Yes, it is a Krabby Patty.\r\nSpongeBob: Mm-hmm.\r\nPlankton: But, it's my version of a Krabby Patty.  After thousands of failed attempts to steal the recipe, I learned all but one ingredient needed to make Krabby Patties. The most important ingredient, the secret ingredient. Over the years, I've methodically gone through almost every letter of the alphabet. Right now I'm on the R's. And I've gotten up to raw sewage.\r\nSpongeBob: Yuck.\r\nPlankton: Try it, tell me what you think.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, he's clean. But if Plankton didn't steal the ingredient, who did?\r\nPatrick: Good question.\r\nSpongeBob: Only someone who specializes in science, could reverse engineer the recipe, based on the secret ingredient. Hmm, a scientist.  There she is.  You hang back. I'm going in for a closer look.  Oh, my gosh! It is Sandy!  Enjoying them Krabby Patties lady?\r\nSandy: SpongeBob! How long have you been standing there buddy?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh long enough, \"buddy.\"\r\nSandy: I was just storing food for the impending winter. Want one?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm onto you, squirrel.  You thought no one could figure it out, but I pieced it together. I know exactly how you got all those patties.\r\nSandy: What exactly are you getting at, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: What I am getting at, is that you...  ...cloaked yourself an invisibility potion, snuck through the security perimeter...\r\nS.W.A.T. Team Member 2: What was that?\r\nS.W.A.T. Team Member 1: Here's the secret Krabby Patty ingredient.\r\nSpongeBob: ...then used a time-freezing device to freeze time, used a laser beam to cut open the case, stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient,  reverse engineered it, and made your own patties. So you wouldn't have to pay.\r\nSandy: Or, perhaps I walked into the Krusty Krab, purchased them,  and received a receipt for these legally obtained patties!\r\nSpongeBob: 283 Krabby Patties.  That's right, I cooked this order. I guess this means you didn't use a laser beam, or invisibility.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob, next time before you run around accusing people of things, make sure your own house is in order first!\r\nSpongeBob: My own house, huh?  Why'd you do it, Gary?!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: You've told us that story 100 times now, Gary. Unfortunately, my partner and I don't want to hear stories, we want to hear the truth! Look, we know you stole the secret ingredient and it's obvious how you did it!  First, you hitched a ride on a security chopper, then jumped into the drop zone. Then, when I stopped to pull up my sock, you snuck up behind me, and did what any snail could do. You shot corrosive acid from your tearducts, which melted the case, allowing you to steal the secret ingredient.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, you're right, Gary, that is impossible. I never would have stopped to pull up my sock during a pickup.\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: What's that, Gary?\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: You did see someone leaving the Krusty Krab with a mysterious black case that night? Mr. Snail, could you please describe this, this marauder to the sketch artist.\r\nGary: Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.\r\nPatrick: I can't believe it! It was Squidward!\r\nSpongeBob: Open up in there, Tentacles! We know you're in there! We just want to ask you a few...  Not cooperating.\r\nPatrick: You know what to do.\r\nSquidward: And one, and...\r\nSpongeBob: Gotcha! You thought you could hide your crimes.\r\nPatrick: But we hear-ed what you've done.\r\nSquidward: If I cared, I'd ask what this is about.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm glad you asked, because this is about you stealing the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!  And we have an eye witness who saw you leaving the scene of the crime, with a mysterious black case.\r\nSquidward: A case like this?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes! Because you can't make Krabby Patties without...  tap dancing shoes?\r\nSquidward: That's right! I was in a tap contest on the night in question. As you can see from my third place medallion.\r\nSpongeBob: I guess this means you didn't steal the secret ingredient.\r\nSquidward: Get out of my house!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know how, sir, but somebody stole the Krabby Patty secret ingredient!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you were in charge of guarding that secret ingredient with your life!\r\nSpongeBob: I know, Mr. Krabs. It just slipped away from me somehow.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, do you have any leads, or clues?\r\nSpongeBob: All I know is that it had to be someone who knew about the delivery, and was at the Krusty Krab during the delivery, and this person would have to know what to do with the secret ingredient when he got it.\r\nMr. Krabs: That would be... you, SpongeBob! You stole me secret ingredient!\r\nSpongeBob: Me?!\r\nMr. Krabs: That's right. And I know exactly how you carried out this little caper.  You obviously set up a decoy to take the delivery. Then when no one was looking, you swooped in, stole the secret ingredient, and spirited it away to the Chum Bucket,  where you sold it to Plankton to make a quick buck.  Don't talk! You can tell it to the cops, 'cause I'm calling them right now!\r\nPoliceman: No need. We heard it all from this barrel.\r\nMr. Krabs: Then arrest this thief, Officer!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, isn't that the stolen secret ingredient?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, what are you talking about, SpongeBob? I'm not holding any secret ingredient.\r\nPoliceman: You might want to stand that you stole the item in question?\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I wouldn't call it stealing...\r\nPoliceman: And you were going to let someone else take the fall for this little caper?\r\nMr. Krabs: I can explain!\r\nPoliceman: Please do.\r\nMr. Krabs: It's simple, $1.99 is a lot to pay for the secret ingredient every time I get a delivery, so I s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s... took it to avoid paying, you know.\r\nPoliceman: I think Judge Trout will be very interested to hear this little story.\r\nMr. Krabs: What? What'd I do?\r\nJudge: All rise. Eugene Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Your honor.\r\nJudge: As punishment for committing the crime of grand theft, I sentence you to give away Krabby Patties for free, all day tomorrow.\r\nMr. Krabs: Give away me patties for free? Oh no, I couldn't bear the sight of that.\r\nSpongeBob: Step right up, and get your free Krabby Patties!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`109a\r\nBoating Buddies\r\nSpongeBob: 97, 98, 99, 100.

I'll teach you everything I know, and then we can.\r\nSquidward: We won't be doing anything, because there is no we! Understand?\r\nMrs. Puff: Quiet in the front please.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I understand. I understand perfectly, boating buddy.\r\nMrs. Puff: Okay class, how about we get to know our new students, by telling each other why we were sentenced to I mean why we are enrolled in boating school.\r\nStudent: Um, I got caught speeding.\r\nMrs. Puff: Very good.

What about you, sir?\r\nSquidward: Me?\r\nMrs. Puff: Yes. Would you like to tell the rest of the class, why you're with us today?\r\nSquidward: Why I'm.  All right, I'll tell you. I was trying to get away, from him! He is the bane, of my existence!\r\nMrs. Puff: Yours too? Uhh. What I meant to say was, please come up to the chalkboard, and draw a diagram of the incident.\r\nSquidward: Gladly.  It all started when I left my house. And then, he appeared. He made, an immediate right turn, and parked, here.  Seeing the oncoming hazard, I looked both ways, and proceeded safely toward my vehicle. It was then, that I realized that I was being followed, at an unsafe distance. So, in order to create more optimal driving conditions, I was then forced to par-take in  evasive action. And by increasing speed slightly, I created a safety cushion, while in-invertenttly attracting the attention, of said law enforcement official. May I sit down now, sweet cheeks?\r\nMrs. Puff: Why, certainly. And perhaps now, SpongeBob would like to come up, and illustrate his side of the story.\r\nSquidward: His side?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, first, I started over here. And then I went way over here. Do-do-do-do, like that. Then, I went around like this, and over here like that, and across this lane, and down here like this, and then  and then I went around, and stopped right here.\r\nEveryone: SpongeBob and Squidward, best boating buddies, forever.\r\nSpongeBob: Do you like it Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Shut it.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, lunch time, eh boating buddy?\r\nSquidward: I'll have to eat over here, like in grade school.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, do you have any mustard in there?\r\nSquidward: Mm, bon appetite, Squidy.

SpongeBob, give me that wheel!\r\nSpongeBob: I got it, I got it.\r\nSquidward: Just let go of it!\r\nGrandma: Hooligans!\r\nScientest 1: Johnson, I finally figured out a way to shrink an ordinary mail man, down to the size of a grain of sand.\r\nScientist 2: How?\r\nScientist 1: By using this shrink ray.\r\nScientist 2: Mother of mercy!

No!\r\nScientist 2: No, no, no.\r\nCowboy: I never will understand these city folk.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, where'd Squidward go?\r\nSquidward: I was just leaving.\r\nMrs. Puff: Okay class, it's time to take our final exam. Please have your pencils ready.\r\nSpongeBob: Pst, hey, boating buddy, if you need any help, I've taken this test hundreds of times, and-\r\nSquidward: How many times do I have to tell you?! I am not your buddy! I don't need your help, and I don't need you, ever! Now just kindly let me take this stupid test, so I can get out of here, and never have to see you again, for the rest of my life!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay Squidward, if that's the way you want it.\r\nSquidward: Thank you.\r\nMrs. Puff: 3 more minutes class.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob? SpongeBob, I need your help.\r\nMrs. Puff: 2 more minutes.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, please? This is important.\r\nSpongeBob: You said you didn't need my help, Squidward, and that you didn't need me.\r\nSquidward: No no, I didn't. I never said that.  I don't need your help, and I don't need you!  Jerk!  All right, I said it. But that was before.\r\nSpongeBob: Before what?\r\nSquidward: Before before.\r\nMrs. Puff: 1 more minute, class.\r\nSquidward: Before we were,  boating buddies.\r\nSpongeBob: Yay!\r\nMrs. Puff: Okay class, time’s up.\r\nSquidward: Time can't be up.

What am I supposed to do?\r\nMrs. Puff: You do the same thing that everybody else does who failed the test, you take it again next week.\r\nSquidward: Next week?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry Squidward, I've never gotten one answer right on this test.

So I took out an ad in the Bikini Bottom Examiner to bring in some new customers! Twas a bargain too.  Only cost me a nickel. So tell me now, boy. How many new customers we got out there so far?\r\nSpongeBob: Oooh, let me see there was... none.\r\nMr. Krabs: What? What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper?  Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months.  While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?\r\nNat: Ha! Nobody reads the Examiner, bud. It's all full of boring charts and facts!  The Bottomfeeder's where it's at! It's got like interesting stories and stuff.\r\nMr. Krabs: \"Fishboy Strikes Again?\"  Wait a minute, aren't these stories a little less than truthful?\r\nNat: I don't know. But they're selling!\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes, they certainly are.  Please, allow me.\r\nAbigail: Thank you!\r\nMr. Krabs: No, thank you.  Now let's see how much they charge for advertising.  25¢ per word! The newspaper business sure is easy money!  That gives me an idea!\r\nSpongeBob: What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy?\r\nSquidward: Yep, what another wonderful hum-drum day slinging burgers.\r\nMr. Krabs: Off of your duff, boy. You think I spent all last night assembling this printing press, so you could laze around all day? From now on you'll be twice as busy. And I expect you to wear 2 hats. 'Cause along with your usual fry cooking duties, you're my new lead reporter for the new Krabby Kronicle!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh! My very own press badge!\r\nMr. Krabs: That's right, boy! And here's your very own camera! So you'll need it to document all them juicy stories you're gonna write. Now what are you waiting for, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look.  No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for!  Patrick Star, I'm scoop SquarePants from the Krabby Kronicle. Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today?\r\nPatrick: Oh, I'm not taking a bus, SpongeBob. I am watching this pole. So the next time it moves, I will see it!\r\nSpongeBob: Whoa, this story is juicy!\r\nMr. Krabs: What a money-tastical day! Eh, Mr. Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Yeah, I'm just breaking it in.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm excited about all the newspaper sales, too.\r\nSquidward: We haven't sold any papers today.\r\nMr. Krabs: What do you mean we haven't sold any newspapers? Certainly this gentlemen would like a copy of the Krabby Kronicle.\r\nFrank: Looks boring. Can I just have a Krabby Patty?\r\nMr. Krabs: Too boring?  SpongeBob!  What's the meaning of this?\r\nSpongeBob: Meaning of what, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: \"Local Resident Watches Pole?\" No one's gonna pay to read this malarkey! When you write these stories, you've gotta use a little imagination, boy.\r\nSpongeBob: Imagination!\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah. Maybe instead of \"Man Watches Pole,\" you could say something like... oh... \"Man Marries Pole.\" Then you can alter the photo a little to fit the headline and, see?  Now that's a juicy story!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, isn't that lying?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't think of it as lying, boy. Think of it as... uh... a practical joke. You know. Something everybody can have a good laugh about. The public expects a little embellishment here and there, so I want you to go out there, and get me a lead story that'll sell!\r\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff is going to laugh her hat off when she reads this!\r\nMr. Krabs: \"Boating Teacher in High Speed Chase!\" I think you finally done it, boy! You've given me a story that'll sell! And sell it has!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but that isn't the story I wrote.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's called editorial privilege, son. It gives you that extra oomph to move units. Besides, how could such a little news story, possibly affect Mrs. Puff in any way?\r\nMrs. Puff: I can't believe such a little news story could have ruined my business!\r\nSpongeBob: Let's see what there is to see. Wait a minute. Larry the Lobster. Hmm, wonder what kind of dirt he has under those muscles.  Uh-huh, this looks shady, very shady.\r\nFrankie: Larry, hey, tough guy? Can I punch you in the gut?\r\nLarry: Sure. Everybody does. It won't hurt me a bit.

Let me take in the fact that my life is ruined!\r\nSpongeBob: Ruined? What are you talking about?\r\nLarry: These lies someone wrote about me.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thanks for your business, and here's your paper.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I have a word with you?\r\nMr. Krabs: Make it quick, boy. These papers are selling faster then we can print 'em!\r\nSpongeBob: That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't think these stories are doing anyone any good.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, they're certainly doing me some good.  Can you believe it? Look at all this loot!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but isn't there a way we could write juicy stories without hurting people?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ah, you just don't get it, do you boy? We're not hurting anyone. We're just making their lives interesting, for everybody else.  Now get out there, and fetch another story!\r\nPlankton: Oh, Karen! I think this is it!

I haven't done anything.\r\nHealth Inspector: That's not what this says.\r\nPlankton: \"Plankton's Chum Made of Your Chums? The Chum Bucket serves your friends in more ways than one?\"  What?!  Who's to blame for this? Who?!?\r\nMr. Krabs: You're reaching new levels of imagination, boy-o!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I... I know.\r\nMr. Krabs: What's wrong. boy?

I know what they're saying. They're saying: Owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners, owners. Please, please, please, please please, please, please don't be this way. They're saying they don't want this type of pampering. They want to be treated as companions, not dress-up dolls. They don't want scratchy outfits, they want to be scratched! They are protesting the indignity of wigs and jewel-encrusted collars and they want to be free from superficial and degrading pageants, like these.\r\nPets: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.\r\nSpongeBob: You were trying to tell me that all along, weren't you, Gary?\r\nGary: Meow, meow!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I won't let it happen again.\r\nJudge: Well, I think we can all agree that this year’s groomers cup goes to... SpongeBob and his wonderful pet!\r\nSpongeBob: Did you hear that, Gary? They're rewarding you for standing up and speaking out against injustice. Maybe these pageants aren't so superficial after all.\r\nJudge: What are you talking about? The snail didn't win, I was referring to your other pet. He's so adorable.\r\nPatrick: Woof, woof!\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`111\r\nSpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One\r\nSquidward: If it gets any hotter in here, we're gonna have to put fried calamari on the menu.\r\nSpongeBob: It's a good thing that new ceiling fan Mr. Krabs installed is still working.\r\nMr. Krabs: Were you talking to me, Squidward?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs.

Island. Although, we sometimes refer to it as an... island.\r\nSpongeBob: We were just at Goo Lagoon selling Krabby Patties when this big wave hit us. Now we're on an island?\r\nTwitch: The ocean works in mysterious ways.\r\nAwesome Eddie: And waves.\r\nTwitch: Mysterious waves.\r\nIsland wanderers: Om.\r\nPatrick: Om.\r\nSpongeBob: How did you guys get here?\r\nTwitch: Oh, we've been here since we dropped out of junior college. This is Awesome Eddie, Big G...\r\nChip: Hi.\r\nTwitch: Chip, and Silent Stan.\r\nTwitch: And I'm Twitch.\r\nSpongeBob: Why do they call you Twitch?\r\nTwitch: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Never mind.\r\nSpongeBob: So what did you say this house is made from again?\r\nTwitch: Guano.\r\nSquidward: Great.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, it's been fun hanging out with you guys, but Mr. Krabs didn't give us the day off. So we gotta get back to Goo Lagoon.\r\nTwitch: Yo, you're miles from the tourist track now, dude.\r\nAwesome Eddie: Yeah. The only way back is to surf there.\r\nSpongeBob: O-only way.... back... surfing.... Bikini Bottom? AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!  I don't know how to surf!\r\nAwesome Eddie: Whoa, chill out, little dude. We can teach you.\r\nSpongeBob: Cool!\r\nNarrator: Ah, learning how to surf. To some it comes as easily as eating an ice cream cone on a hot day.\r\nNarrator: Others...\r\nNarrator: ... well... to them, it's like eating an ice cream cone... on a cold day. Sometimes, in surfing, it's the approach that's most important.\r\nNarrator: And sometimes, it's the retreat.\r\nNarrator: Once in a life-time, that perfect wave comes along. Not too big, not too small, and the surfer has to act fast...\r\nTwitch: Go!\r\nNarrator: ... or he stands to miss the ride of his life.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Wanna see something cool?\r\nPatrick: You bet!\r\nSpongeBob: Down here!  See?

Especially the one on the end over there.\r\nAwesome Eddie: What's that?\r\nAwesome Eddie: Oh, no. There's no way, dude. He'd never do it.\r\nSpongeBob: What's he saying?\r\nTwitch: He reminded us that there is one dude who could possibly teach you. If you can find him.\r\nSpongeBob: Who?\r\nTwitch: His name  is Jack Kahuna Laguna. Or JKL, for short.\r\nAwesome Eddie and Chip: Amen.\r\nTwitch: We say that legend says that JKL was last seen up-river at the Kahmamoku Cove, where every wave is perfect.\r\nPatrick: Will there be nachos there?\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks again for letting us borrow these surfboards, Twitch.\r\nTwitch: No problem. And just keep following the river straight up until you hit Kahmamoku Cove. Can't miss it.\r\nSpongeBob: How far up stream did you say it was?\r\nTwitch: Well, we don't know cause we've never ever been there.\r\nAwesome Eddie: We're definitely afraid of this river and wouldn't even set foot in it if you paid us.\r\nTwitch: Yeah, interpret that any way you want.\r\nSandy: Oh, where am I?

He'll be here.\r\nSquidward: You've never even seen him!\r\nSpongeBob: You've got to stop judging people by the way they look.\r\nSquidward: You're right.\r\nPatrick: Look!\r\nSpongeBob: It's him!\r\nSquidward: Oh, my j-\r\nSpongeBob: It's JKL! Hail O great swami of the Gnarly Pounders! We seek audience with thee.\r\nPatrick: Plus, we wanna talk to you.\r\nSpongeBob: Will you teach us how to surf, O great one, so we may get back home?\r\nPatrick: Uh...\r\nSquidward: Look, surf-boy, are you gonna teach us how to surf, or are we just gonna stand here and stare at you all day?\r\nPatrick: I kinda like staring at him.\r\nSpongeBob: I've never seen anything more beautiful. Have you, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Not since I saw my first triple-layer cheese cake.\r\nJKL: That... was your first lesson.\r\nSquidward: What? You call that a lesson? We just stood here and watched you surf for two and a half hours!\r\nJKL: Just keep breathing.\r\nMr. Krabs: Locust. Culinary! Oh.  Look, Cashy!  Earrings!

I think we're about to receive another lesson.\r\nJKL: Just... keep breathing.\r\nSquidward: That's it?! I just wanna go home!\r\nSpongeBob: Would it make you feel better if I went and talked to him?\r\nSquidward: Oh, thank you. Thank you, SpongeBob.  Well, did you talk to him?\r\nSpongeBob: Yup.\r\nSquidward: And?\r\nSpongeBob: He said we just have to stare into this fire all night, and the secrets will be revealed.\r\nSquidward: We're gonna be stuck here forever!\r\nSandy: Well, Sandy, using only your bare hands and the resources found on this deserted island, you have not only survived, but thrived. You've built a five star hotel, a steam-powered generator, a car that runs on coconut milk, and even a espresso bar. I almost don't wanna leave. But I miss Bikini Bottom. Now I can find SpongeBob and the gang and fly us right back.  Acorn 1 to Tower. Request clearance.\r\nDennis: Roger, Acorn 1. You are clear for take-off.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman! I didn't mean to spill your groceries!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Well, normally, I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little low on cash this month, so I have no way to pay for more. Unless you have some money I can borrow.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, I...  Cashy! Please! Cashy is the closest thing to a friend I've ever had!\r\nSquidward: Oh, oh. Please tell me you two didn't stare into that fire all night.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Okay...\r\nSquidward: All right, I'm done! Hey, blondey! Teach me how to surf so I can go home, or I'm gonna...\r\nJKL: You obviously didn't stare into the fire all night like your friends over there.\r\nJKL: Those dudes are gonna make awesome surfers.\r\nSpongeBob: Where's he going?!

Is this the next part of our training?\r\nJKL: Uh...\r\nJKL: These clouds. They can only mean one thing.\r\nPatrick: Increased chance of precipitation?\r\nJKL: Yes. Every thousand years or so, the planets align in such a way that a perfect wave is formed.\r\nSpongeBob: A perfect wave?\r\nJKL: The world's biggest, fastest, longest, gnarliest, most totally awesome, perfect wave. They call it.... the Big One.\r\nPatrick: Hey, that's what they used to call me!\r\nJKL: It's probably the only wave big enough for you to ride all the way back to Bikini Bottom. And you'll have to catch it, or you'll be stuck here... forever.  The Big One is almost upon us.\r\nMr. Krabs: Please! Please, Mr. Dutchman! Let Cashy go! I promise I'll never soil your waters again!\r\nFlying Dutchman: Ya promise?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, yes.

Vhat is it that you two know how to do?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs tells me I'm pretty good with a spatula.\r\nSquidward: Ha.\r\nGordon: Quiet. You're our ship's new head chef. And... vhat can you do?\r\nSquidward: Well, if you must know, I'm a widely renowned clarinet virtuoso, state-recognized interior design consultant, licensed and board certified antique macrame conosuor, born and raised collector and sculptor of driftwood, and able to recognize over 13 hundred brand names of single-personed pedal operate vehicles at a single glance.

Let's not forget you're the one who dragged me onto this crate in the first place! Now, you ask me to pour my heart out, and this is the respect I get?! Well, you got another thing coming, honey! I want off this boat, pronto!  On second thought, bathroom attendants make me some tips. Well, look on the bright side, Squidward. No more living next door to SpongeBob. Let her rip, Jack-o!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait!  You can't do that.\r\nGordon: You mean to question the vill of the tribe?\r\nSpongeBob: If it means saving my best friend, then yes.\r\nGordon: Vell.

What have you got in there?  Quasi-Gummy Chewy Candy Fish. Is this how you have fun? By eating your own kind? Scum like you make me sick. Cuff him!\r\nGray Fish: That's a shame what happened to Dale.

I'll always cherish those last kind words that you said to me.\r\nMrs. Puff: Make sure you return that bathroom key to my desk or you're in big trouble mister!\r\nSpongeBob: Ohh!

I'm so proud you followed your ol' Grampa's peg leg and became a pirate, that I'll be sailing by for a ship's inspection. That vessel better be well-oiled or you'll be dancing the short plank jig. Happy looting! Grampa Redbeard!  Grandpa Readbeard comin’ bla, bla, bla!\r\nSpongeBob: I didn't know your grandpa was a pirate, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Aye, I come from a whole family of pirates. Gramps used to say, \"The Krabs Clan has been pirates for as long as we've had claws.\" And he wanted me to be a pirate, too.\r\nGrandpa Redbeard: One day, you'll be a plunderin' pirate just like yer ol' granddad here.\r\nMr. Krabs: So I bought me a ship, hired a crew.....\r\nCrew member: Aaarrrrr!\r\nMr. Krabs: And for years, I drifted the high seas as a pirate. And booty did abound.\r\nMr. Krabs: I started to notice a recurring fee. I just wasn't turning enough profit.

Just remember, the only rule in the Pirate's Code of Honor is: Never tell a lie.\r\nMr. Krabs: For all he knows, the Krusty Krab is a pirate ship. If he were to find out the truth, it would break his salty, barnacle encrusted heart. Boo-hoo!\r\nSpongeBob: Why don't we just make the Krusty Krab look like a pirate ship.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hm. Not a bad idea, boy. But we're gonna need a first rate crew.\r\nSpongeBob: We've got Squidward. And I could get Patrick to join up.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, me hearties! Get this one thing clear. If Grandpa Redbeard is ever gonna believe I'm a pirate, ye landlubbers are gonna have to pass as a pirate crew. Which means, I want you to look like a pirate.  I want you to talk like a pirate.\r\nSpongeBob: Swarthy! I mean...shiver me timbers!\r\nMr. Krabs: But most importantly, I want you to smell like a pirate.  Very convincing, Patrick. And as me crew, you'll be makin' the Krusty Krab into an imitation pirate ship!

Let's sail!\r\nSpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Aye, sir!\r\nSpongeBob: Ahoy, Captain! We be catchin' a mighty gale from the northeast.\r\nMr. Krabs: Indeed, indeed. And just look at the treacherous surf in our path!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, that salty sea air be so thick, ya can almost taste it.\r\nGrandpa Redbeard: Aye.\r\nMr. Krabs: I better take the helm and guide us to safer waters. Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there, eh, Granddad? I said, \"Aye, that be a wicked soundin' wind out there!\"\r\nSpongeBob: Oh!\r\nMr. Krabs: There it is! That wind storm I mentioned earlier, it...and, apparently me cabin is haunted as well.\r\nGrandpa Redbeard: What's a hair net doin' on a pirate ship? Every pirate knows that the majority of his daily nutrition comes from whatever hair or skin flakes fall off the coke and into the stew. This hair net is deprivi' your crew of its essential nutrients.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, just a sec.  Look out, Grandpa! We're under attack!\r\nKraken: Grrrrrr....\r\nGrandpa Redbeard: Aye, look at the size of that beast.\r\nMr. Krabs: Not to worry, Granddad.\r\nGrandpa Redbeard: Aha!

What do we do first?\r\nSquidward: Say goodbye.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Goodbye!\r\nSquidward: Morons.\r\nSpongeBob: So anyway, Squidward, I was thinking we should be working on our secret lodge initiation.\r\nPatrick: Hey.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick and I have come up with a secret hand-shake.\r\nPatrick: Secret!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Patty-cake, patty-cake, sailor man! Bake me a cake as fast...\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob! That's not a secret hand-shake! Everybody knows Patty-cake!\r\nSpongeBob: Not the way we do it.\r\nPatrick: We don't use our pinkies.\r\nSquidward: Out!\r\nPatrick: I don't think Squidward wants to join our lodge.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, sure he does. He just needs a little push.\r\nSquidward: Oh, what now? I'm coming! What do you... Great. Must be one of SpongeBob's pranks.\r\nSpongeBob: Let's move.\r\nThey arrive at Jellyfish Fields.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, we can let him out now.\r\nSquidward: Are you insane? You kidnapped me?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, we didn't kidnap you. We just brought you here for...\r\nPatrick: Initiation.\r\nSquidward: What? What kind of initiation?\r\nSpongeBob: A very special initiation.\r\nSquidward: Oh, boy. Look at the time! Gotta run.\r\nSpongeBob: Would you care to go first, Brother Patrick?\r\nPatrick: After you, Brother SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Ow! Ooo, ooo! Ow!  Brother Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Brother SpongeBob.

Those Feather Buddies better hope they don't run into us in a dark alley.\r\nSquidward: Grrrr.  I don't want to be a Feather Buddy!\r\nSpongeBob: Do you still wanna be a Feather Friend?\r\nSquidward: Grrr...no.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw...Squidward, I hadn't realized how special your lodge was to you. I'll get you back in that club. And I know just how to do it.  Everything we need is in this drawer.\r\nSquidward: A sock?\r\nSpongeBob: Not just a sock...a disguise. Patrick and I will climb inside the sock and pretend to be a giant albino eel. We will then gain entrance to the lodge, and frighten everyone inside. Once they're good and terrified, you, Squidward, will storm in, defeat that giant eel, and rescue all the lodge members. You'll be a hero, Squidward. They'll have to let you back in the lodge!\r\nPatrick: Hm. It's genius. But, I see one flaw in your plan.\r\nSquidward: One flaw?\r\nPatrick: That sock is way too small.\r\nSpongeBob: It is. Time to break out the heavy artillery.\r\nPatrick: That's what I'm talkin' about!\r\nIt is night time at the Cephalopod Lodge.\r\nAlbino eel (SpongeBob): Okay, Squidward. Just give us five minutes and then do your stuff.\r\nSquidward: Huh.\r\nNarrator: 5 minutes later...\r\nSquidward: This is ridiculous, No one is dumb enough to believe SpongeBob and Patrick are a..a....giant albino eel!\r\nPatrick: Roooo!\r\nSpongeBob: Roar!\r\nPatrick: Roo!\r\nSpongeBob: Roar!\r\nSquidward: Unbelievable.\r\nLodge member: Squidward!\r\nBrother Roger: Look out!\r\nLodge member: There's a giant albino eel on the loose!\r\nSquidward: Do not worry. I will save you. Be gone, foul beast, or, I will smite thee.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Oh! Oh, ow! Ow! Oof!\r\nLodge members: Squidward! Squidward!

Bunch of nonsense!\r\nMusic School Headmaster: Why, here he comes now.\r\nMusic School Headmistress: It is him!\r\nSquidward: Huh?\r\nMusic School Headmistress: Aren't you the esteemed Squilliam Fancyson the Third, who we all came here to see perform tonight?\r\nSquidward: No, I am not, nor would I ever want to be! I am quite content being Squidward Q. Tentacles.\r\nMusic School Headmistress: Oh, dear. Well, that's too bad.\r\nSquidward: Why?\r\nMusic School Headmistress: Because I'm head matron at an esteemed musical college in town and thought if you were Squilliam Fancyson, I would offer you the high-paying and prestigious opportunity to come there and teach your very own music class.\r\nSquidward: My very own music class? Did you say \"Squilliam Fancyson\"?\r\nMusic School Headmistress: Yes.\r\nSquidward: I'm... Squilliam Fancyson.\r\nMusic School Headmistress: But didn't you just say a minute ago that your name was Squidward Q. Tentacles?\r\nSquidward: It is... No, I mean, uh, no, no, I didn't!\r\nMusic School Headmistress: Well, that's a relief. I mean, what kind of a moron would go to their worst enemy's music recital?\r\nMusic School Headmaster: A very pathetic one, that's whom.\r\nSquidward: Oh.\r\nMusic School Headmistress: Well, good evening, Professor Squilliam.\r\nSquidward: Who? Ha, um, uh, and a good evening to you as well.\r\nMusic School Headmaster: Hmm, music types.\r\nMusic School Headmistress: Ooh, they're so strange.\r\nSquidward: Good evening, students. Now, our first...\r\nStudents: Good evening, Professor.\r\nSquidward: As I was saying, our first...\r\nSquidward: Yes?\r\nBilly: Aren't you gonna write your name on the board like most professors do?\r\nSquidward: My-my name? What for?\r\nBilly: Well, you know, it just seems like teachers usually write their names on the board the first day of class.\r\nSquidward: Why don't you come write your name on the board? We'll see how you like it.\r\nBilly: Okay.\r\nSquidward: There, now how does that feel, Billy?\r\nBilly: Okay, I-I guess.\r\nSquidward: Good. Now, why don't you take your seat and stop poking your nose into other people's business?!  Now, if we can go for five minutes without having any further interruptions. I would like to...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, look! It's Squid...\r\nSquidward: Squilliam, everybody, he was about to say \"Squilliam\"!\r\nPatrick: Oh, uh, oh, actually, I think he was about to say Squid...\r\nSquidward: Didn't you two nincompoops know? I have my name legally changed to Squilliam Fancyson. And you are to refer to me only as Professor Squilliam from now until the end of time. Now blink twice so I know you understand.  Okay, good.  Hey, he blinked three times!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, only eight minutes in and we've already been given a math quiz. Very advanced music class, huh, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I'll say.\r\nSquidward: Would you two numb skulls mind telling me what you're doing in music class anyway?\r\nSpongeBob: Sure! Patrick's New Year's resolution was to learn to play an instrument!\r\nSquidward: You told me your resolution was to sign up for an all natural slimming, toning, and increased muscle mass program!\r\nPatrick: It was. I traded with SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: And I have been very happy with the results. See?\r\nSquidward: Wow, those are impressive results.\r\nSquidward: As you may not be aware, music is a...  Music is a...  Music is a complicated series of...  ...is a complicated series of notes that when played in the...  SpongeBob, do you mind?! There are other people here besides you, you know. And I don't think they appreciate you depriving them of my wisdom!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Professor Squilliam.  Patrick here keeps tickling my foot.\r\nPatrick: No way! He's making that up! It was him!\r\nSquidward: You expect me to believe he was tickling himself?\r\nPatrick: You better tell him, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, it was me.\r\nSquidward: You were tickling yourself?\r\nSpongeBob: Mm hmm!\r\nSquidward: How?\r\nSpongeBob: Like this.\r\nSquidward: Alright, that's enough!\r\nSquidward: There. Now, as I was saying, music is a series of complex...  SpongeBob, I told you to stop tickling yourself!\r\nPatrick: Actually, that time, it really was me.\r\nSquidward: Now, I'm going to put some notes on the chalkboard.  Excuse me? Is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?\r\nPatrick: Uh-uh.\r\nSquidward: Go on, you've already interrupted once. You might as well tell us what was so very important.\r\nPatrick: Well, I was just saying that these lines you drew remind me of a railroad track.\r\nSquidward: I have never heard anything more insipid, insane, uninteresting, or irrelevant!\r\nPatrick: Well, actually, there was a railroad convention in town last week, and I bought myself this nifty conductor's cap.\r\nSquidward: I have never seen a more ridiculous looking outfit on top of anybody's head, anywhere!\r\nPatrick: Well, I don't know. Suits my needs.\r\nSquidward: What else did you buy at this convention? Your very own locomotive?\r\nPatrick: Yes.\r\nSquidward: Ha! Ha! Ha! What the...?\r\nSquidward: Now, where were...  ...we?\r\nSquidward: This is what's known as a metronome.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, my mom has one of those in her garden!\r\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob, that was a garden gnome.\r\nSquidward: Anyway, the metronome helps us keep time.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick...\r\nSquidward: Do you mind?  Is there something seriously wrong with your HEADS?!\r\nSpongeBob: My whole life has been pointed in one direction.\r\nPatrick: I see that now. There's never been any choice for me.\r\nSquidward: Will you two nincompoops cut it out?! Or am I gonna...\r\nBikini Bottom News Reporter: Hello! We're with the local Bikini Bottom News Channel.

Scoop?!\r\nBikini Bottom News Reporter: Well, it's the sort of thing that borders the paranormal. Our viewers just eat that stuff up.\r\nSquidward: Paranormal?! The only thing paranormal around here is how fast I'm going to make you two disappear!!\r\nBikini Bottom News Reporter: Don't blame me, blame the market.\r\nSpongeBob: Wha...? Where am I?

I'm in charge, so you'll be having all the fun.\r\nSquidward: Doing what?\r\nSpongeBob: Painting the walls, buffing the tables, sewing pretty curtains, washing the windows, varnishing the stools, hanging the ferns, waxing the toilets. Oh, you lucky dog!\r\nSquidward: Hey, SpongeBob, do you want to hear another Krusty Krab secret?\r\nSpongeBob: There's another secret? What's the secret?\r\nSquidward: Do you want to know how Mr. Krabs gets all these customers?\r\nSpongeBob: How?\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs keeps this place a dump, so the food's more better by comparison!\r\nSpongeBob: Sounds like the Chum Bucket.\r\nSquidward: Ah, but you'll be doing it on purpose.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh...  How's this, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Lookin' good!\r\nSpongeBob: You mean, \"lookin' bad!\" Enjoy our fine décor!\r\nNat: Next time, I'm picking the restaurant.\r\nSpongeBob: One Krusty Krab, covered in mud and slime!\r\nSquidward: Mmm, you missed a spot.\r\nSpongeBob: Got it!

Squidward sleeping on the job?! Okay, that's actually normal. SpongeBob! What have ye done to me Krusty Krab!\r\nSpongeBob: I was just following Squidward's advice, Mr. Krabs.

This is a build-it-yourself telescope. The only problem is, I can't figure out how to put the darn thing together. That's where you come in.\r\nSpongeBob: \"Telescope Assembly Manual\"...\r\nMr. Krabs: Now read this cover-to-cover, and be prepared to put this together at me house tonight.\r\nSpongeBob: Tonight?\r\nMr. Krabs: That's not gonna be a problem, is it?\r\nSpongeBob: Umm... Well, actually...\r\nMr. Krabs: Excellent! Because I was looking at your annual employee report card... ...and it appears the \"Does Laborious Task for Supervisor\" box is unchecked.

You're supposed to bring my birthday cake!\r\nSpongeBob: Tonight?\r\nPatrick: Yes, tonight! Well, when else am I gonna celebrate it? At least I had the courtesy to start the party after my best friend got off of work. See ya tonight, buddy!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Neptune! This is worse than I ever could've imagined!  Right! Time to be all I can be!  Man, these people sure look science-y. Sandy must be pulling out all the stops for this one.  Hey, Sandy! What'cha doing?\r\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob! Just putting the finishing touches on my invention. Thanks for assisting me! You're such a big help! No wonder Mr. Krabs relies on you so heavily.\r\nSpongeBob: I gotta help Mr. Krabs! Uh, Sandy, I gotta run to the, uh, gents' room.  Now, if I finish up with Mr. Krabs, that'll clear me up to assist Sandy!\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! I knew I wouldn't have to fire ya!\r\nSpongeBob: You can rely on me, sir! I wouldn't wanna jeopardize my employee record.  Okay, let's see what we got here. Oh, it says on page 472, section C-17, that you need a right-angled motorized hex drill to assemble this thing.\r\nMr. Krabs: Really... Why don't you go into town and pick up one of those hex drill thingies.\r\nSpongeBob: I...\r\nMr. Krabs: Or you could sit there and watch me fill out your employee report card...\r\nSpongeBob: \"Dear valued Tom's Toolery customers, we are closed this week in observance of Porpoise Day.

Greetings, my distinguished colleagues! Tonight, you will witness an invention so revolutionary, it may change modern science forever! Now to demonstrate, my assistant will disrobe and enter the machine.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nSandy: Some of you may be wondering why the test subject is disrobing. It is because...  What's under your gown?\r\nSpongeBob: It must be that spicy kelp I ate earlier. I gotta go use the lavatory. I'll be right back!  Happy birthday!\r\nPatrick: You finally made it!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, there was a, uhh... Big... Traffic...

Wait there while I go check.\r\nSandy: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, barnacles.\r\nSandy: I apologize for the delay. Now let's continue the demonstration. I give you, the Protogenerator 2000!  This device gives a single laborer the productivity of 5, 6, 7, up to 8 workers...  ...which is great for the management, but is also a boom for the workers because they'll always get high marks on their employee report card!\r\nMr. Krabs: I was just looking at your employee report card...\r\nSpongeBob: The telescope!\r\nSandy: Without further delay, I will now initiate the protosequence.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, Sandy, I hate to delay the proceedings, but, uh, I forgot to mail in this mail-in rebate and, uh... I'll be right back.  Okay, let's get started, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: What happened to your clothes, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: Sardines! Yeah, I was attacked by a can of wild sardines. Now let's finish this telescope.\r\nMr. Krabs: Boy? Hold on, boy, you're supposed to be using that motorized hex drill! Now, where is it?\r\nSpongeBob: Ugh! I left it at Patrick's rock!\r\nMr. Krabs: Patrick's rock? Whatcha do with it there?  SpongeBob, wait! Get back here, boy!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, why are your clothes invisible?\r\nSpongeBob: Never mind that, could I please borrow your present?\r\nPatrick: No, no, you can't borrow my birthday present!\r\nSpongeBob: Not even for a minute?\r\nPatrick: No, not till you deliver my birthday cake.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, I'll be right back!\r\nPatrick: Hold on, where're you going?\r\nSandy: Hold it! Where is my little assistant going this time?\r\nMr. Krabs: Your little assistant? That's my assistant you're talking to! What's going on here!?!\r\nPatrick: Yeah, I'd like to know also! What kind of a birthday present is this?\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey, SpongeBob was supposed to bring that to me!\r\nSandy: That looks like my power drill!  You've got a lot of explaining to do, mister!\r\nSpongeBob: I've got something to say. I've got something to say. I've got so... I have got something to say!  I know you all had important things tonight. Mr. Krabs, your telescope. Patrick, your birthday. Sandy, you have this big presentation. I just couldn't say \"no\" to any of you.\r\nSandy: Aw, you overextended yourself.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, you should've said something.\r\nPatrick: We could've worked something out.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw. You know, you guys are right. It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once.\r\nSandy: Nonsense, SpongeBob! Of course you can, if you'll just step into the Protogenerator 2000!  First, I close the protochamber...  ...And finally... she presses a button, and there is a glowing light from the chamber, everyone gasps as two SpongeBobs emerge from the tube\r\nSpongeBob #2: D'oh!\r\nSpongeBob #3: D'oh!\r\nSandy: As you can see, I've made two clones of my subject which will allow him to honor all of the commitments he's made this evening.

And today,  a mere ten years later, obviously,  ten years ago, I said that,  he has traveled all the way to a far off land known as, \"Burbank.\"  To find Nicktoons Animation Studio  and meet his idol  face to face for the first time  in  ten years...it's ten years ago.  It's ten years ago.  Let's see what happens, yeah.\r\nPatchy the Pirate: Oh. Bye, Mom. Thanks for the lift.  Hey, kids. Isn't this exciting? I'm here at Nickelodeon, home of SpongeBob SquarePants. And I'm gonna ask him if he'll be my guest of honor on my tenth anniversary TV special.  Come on.  Ahoy.\r\nSecurity Guard: Sir, may I help you?\r\nPatchy: Yes. This is Patchy the Pirate for SpongeBob SquarePants. I believe he's expecting me. I sent him over 400 letters...this week.\r\nSecurity Guard: Uh, yes. SpongeBob is not here right now, sir.\r\nPatchy: That's okay. I can wait.  SpongeBob?!\r\nSecurity Guard: Sir, please step away from the gate.\r\nPatchy: Aw, poop deck. I was hoping I could ask SpongeBob to phone up some of his famous friends so he could ask them to be guests on my show.\r\nSecurity Guard: Uh-huh.  Oh. You're here for the Casting Department.\r\nPatchy: Yeah.\r\nSecurity Guard: In that case, please step right inside, sir.\r\nPatchy: Woo! Oh, hey, when'll SpongeBob be here? Where's he? At lunch?

Well, your mother must be so proud.\r\nTriumph: Listen, Scratchy.\r\nPatchy: It's Patchy.\r\nTriumph: You know, Catchy, maybe you should consider wearing two eye patches. That way, you won't be able to see what's become of your life.\r\nPatchy: What?\r\nTriumph: So, what are you tell me, what are you selling, besides your dignity and self-respect?\r\nPatchy: None of the above.

I want you two to watch all the entrances.\r\nSquidward: You mean the front door and the back door?\r\nMr. Krabs: Those are just the ones on the surface.  There is an entire network of tunnels and air ducts underground and I want all eyes on the look out!\r\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Right. Study the map, stay extra vigilant. Don't fall asleep on the job. That means you, Squidward.\r\nSquidward: What? I have never fallen asleep on duty.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't make me have a flashback.\r\nSquidward: All right, point taken.\r\nMr. Krabs: And to help watch out for Plankton, I've hired some extra security.\r\nSquidward: You hired Patrick?\r\nMr. Krabs: What, you expect me to spend money on a real security guard? You are my first line of defense, Patrick. So, look out for any suspiciorous characters.\r\nPatrick: Yes, sir.  Who are you? And Who are you working for?!\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton doesn't stand a chance.\r\nPlankton: It's a conspiracy, I tell you!

He celebrates eleventy-seven years of success,  I'm left with four score and forty fortnights of failure!  I give up, Karen. Krabs has won!\r\nKaren: Well, you'll never get the formula with that attitude.  Maybe a thousand and four will be your lucky number.\r\nPlankton: Oh, yeah? You try getting launched.\r\nKaren: Oh, right, the launchings.  I've got them all on my hard drive.\r\nMr. Krabs: Fore!\r\nPlankton: Ow!\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm tired today, Plankton.

That last part always makes me laugh.\r\nPlankton: It's just no use!\r\nKaren: Today's the  perfect day to steal the recipe. Krabs will be completely distracted by all the festivities. You can do this.\r\nPlankton: You really think so?\r\nKaren: Of course, I do. Now who's my big man?\r\nPlankton: Oh, Karen.\r\nKaren: Come on. Come on. Who's my big strong man?\r\nPlankton: I am.\r\nKaren: That's right.

Mr. Krabs called me into his office.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you've been working here for a while now, so I think I can trust you. It's time I told you.\r\nSpongeBob: You mean?\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes. The Krabby Patty formular. Follow me, son.  We need to go where no one will ever hear us.  Ugh. We finally made it.  Quick, get into me office before anyone sees us.\r\nPlankton: What? You just went in a circle. Why didn't you just stay in the Krusty Krab?\r\nSpongeBob: We wanted to make sure we weren't followed. Then, Mr. Krabs leaned in close and whispered the recipe.\r\nPlankton: Yes? Go on.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now, remember, you can never tell another living soul.\r\nPlankton: Wait!  Wait! Hold on!\r\nMr. Krabs: What's that?\r\nPlankton: My pen is out of ink.  Okay, okay, go ahead.\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton.  You'll never have get me formula.

If only Sandy was here. She could help us.\r\nPatrick: Oh! Hey, maybe we can use this.  I borrowed it from Sandy's treedome. It might be our way outta here. Shh! Everybody quiet! Hey, Sandy, I got your radio! If you want it back, come and get it! She'll come.\r\nSquidward: Oh, give me that.  Sandy, come in, Sandy.\r\nSandy: Sandy Cheeks here.

And a total rip-off!\r\nFish: What has happened to the theater?\r\nAnother Fish: Lousy Costumes.\r\nWedding Officiant: I didn't know this was a play.\r\nPatchy: Well, kids, this was supposed to be the part of the show where SpongeBob and I were gonna watch old outtakes  and rejected scenes and talk about 'em.  But he never showed up! And now I'm stuck in the belly of a whale! Oh, well. We already paid for the airtime, so here they are.  Hello, children. You know, like any great work of art, SpongeBob did not just appear out of nowhere. He started out as a thought.  Then he evolved into  a primitive rendering... And along the way  to becoming the sponge we all know and love,  he went through many different changes. And phases and phanges.  And pain can be very painful. For instance,  did you know that SpongeBob was not the first choice to star in the show?  Hard to believe, I know. Watch these opening themes, and you'll see why he was eventually picked.\r\nPainty: Are you ready, kids?\r\nKids: Aye, aye, Captain.\r\nPainty: I can't hear you.\r\nKids: Aye, aye, Captain!\r\nPainty: Oh...  ♪Who lives in a monument under the sea?♪\r\nKids: ♪Squidward Tentacles!♪\r\nPainty: ♪Obnoxious, abrasive, conceded is he.♪\r\nKids: ♪Squidward Tentacles!♪\r\nPainty: ♪If practical common sense be something you wish,♪\r\nKids: ♪Squidward Tentacles!♪\r\nPatchy: Next!\r\nPainty: Are you ready, kids?\r\nKids: Aye, aye, Captain.\r\nPainty: I can't hear you.\r\nKids: Aye, aye, Captain!\r\nPainty: Oh...  ♪Who lives like a barnacle under the sea?♪\r\nKids: ♪Patrick Sea Star!♪\r\nPatrick: Oh!\r\nPatchy: No!\r\nPainty: Are you ready, kids?\r\nKids: Aye, aye, Captain.\r\nPainty: I can't hear you.\r\nKids: Aye, aye, Captain!\r\nPainty: Oh...  ♪Who lives in an anchor under the sea?♪\r\nKids: ♪Eugene Krabs does!♪\r\nMr. Krabs: Hey!\r\nPainty: ♪Crusty and red and greedy is he.♪\r\nMr. Krabs: Come back with me money!\r\nKids: ♪Eugene Krabs does!♪\r\nPainty: ♪If stingy and greedy is something you wish,♪\r\nKids: ♪Eugene Krabs does!♪\r\nMr. Krabs: Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.\r\nPatchy: Ugh.

Now Blackbeard  would have been able to get the real A-listers  on his TV special.  Yeah, your Bruce Willises and your Gwyneth Paltrows  and Ricky Gervaises.  Let's not forget him. Brilliant.  He wouldn't even have to shanghai them.  They would have  shown up on set out of respect.  and fear.  Back then, pirates were serious business.  Patchy's kinda  giving pirates a bad name, really,  if I'm being brutally honest.  Oh, well, thanks for watching, kiddies. We'll see you at the 20th anniversary.  That's 10 years from now.

Today's weather forecast calls for—  A horrible storm will ravage the Bikini Bottom area.\r\nPatrick and SpongeBob: A horrible storm?\r\nPhil Preflumster: You heard me. Panic is not advised although it is recommended. Also, an advisory has been issued to avoid any and all jellyfishing if possible.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, help me get these boards nailed up.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, this seems like a strange time to start decorating.\r\nSpongeBob: Start dec— you sir, obviously do not recognize fine decorating when you see it.\r\nPatrick: Hmm.\r\nSpongeBob: Admire it later, Patrick.

You play rock, paper, scissors for it.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah.\r\nPatrick: One.\r\nSpongeBob: Two.\r\nSquidward: Three!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, it's a tie.\r\nPatrick: Darn it!\r\nPatrick, SpongeBob, Squidward: One, two, three.\r\nPatrick: Darn it! I'll get you next time.\r\nSquidward: One, two, three.\r\nSpongeBob: Tie.\r\nPatrick: Darn it!\r\nSquidward: One, two, three.\r\nSpongeBob: Tie.\r\nPatrick: Darn it!\r\nSquidward: There, I win. See?\r\nPatrick: I'm not seeing anything there.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, it looks like a lot of junk.\r\nSquidward: What do you mean, you're not seeing anything?! There's three in a row right here. Tic-tac-toe!\r\nPatrick: Easy, friend.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, relax, Squidward. We're just here to have fun.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, okay, yeah, okay. Here we go. Congratulations, Squidward.\r\nPatrick: Well played.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. You can do it.\r\nSpongeBob: Be the puzzle piece.\r\nPatrick: Cannot complete jigsaw puzzle! Difficulty level too advanced. Rate of brain activity increasing. Ageing process by 30 years per second.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. You still got a good few years left in you.\r\nPatrick: Eh?\r\nSpongeBob: Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, Go! Go, Patrick, go! Go, Patrick, go!\r\nSquidward: Grrr!\r\nSpongeBob: Go, Patrick, go!\r\nSquidward: I told you creatures I was trying to take a nap over here. Now for the last time can't you just—\r\nSpongeBob: Hang on, Squidward. Patrick was just about to figure out where this last piece of the puzzle goes. Weren't you, Patrick?!\r\nPatrick: Who's the green guy?\r\nSquidward: It's the last piece of the puzzle! There's only one place it can go. Right here!\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward. It wasn't your turn. That's cheating.\r\nSquidward: Cheating?! It's a jigsaw puzzle! You can't cheat!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, it's okay, Squidward. We'll just start over.\r\nSquidward: I've got to get out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, welcome back, Squidward. We were about to figure out where the first piece of the puzzle goes. Oh, maybe Squidward can help us fig—\r\nSquidward: No, I can't.\r\nSpongeBob: Please, Squidward?\r\nSquidward: No way.\r\nSpongeBob: Please...\r\nSquidward: I have an even better idea.\r\nSpongeBob: What is it?\r\nPatrick: Tell us.\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Tell us! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!\r\nSquidward: Shh. Quiet time. It's a game called \"boundaries.\"\r\nPatrick: Ooh-ooh-ooh!\r\nSquidward: Yes, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Will there be any spelling in this game?\r\nSquidward: Oh, no, no spelling.\r\nPatrick: Yes!\r\nSquidward: It's very simple. The object of the game is to see how long everyone leaves Squidward alone until the storm passes. He will stay inside boundaries, he'll define by chalk lines on the floor.\r\nSpongeBob: I have a question.\r\nSquidward: What?\r\nSpongeBob: Where are you going to get the chalk?\r\nSquidward: I brought some!\r\nSquidward: Brilliant work, as usual, Squidward. Now all I have to do is sit here until this storm blows over.  Wait a minute. I'm starving. SpongeBob's got to have some snacks around here somewhere. Ah, Jackpot.  I bet you wish you had some of this, don't—? Snail food?  I've got to get some real food.\r\nSpongeBob: Halt! Nobody's to cross this boundary.\r\nSquidward: I'm the one who drew the line. You're not supposed to cross.\r\nSpongeBob: If you're the one who drew it, let me see some identification papers.\r\nSquidward: Identific—? Fine. But when this storm blows over, you'll regret this, mister. What the— what? I don't have them. they must be in my other pants. Look, if you just let me cross, I can go get them. Please, I promise I'll—\r\nSpongeBob: Hmm. You may be telling the truth.\r\nSquidward: Oh, thank you. I'm just so hungry.\r\nSpongeBob: But then again, you may not. Come with me. We shall find out the truth.\r\nSquidward: That'll be the day.\r\nSpongeBob: Stop that cephalopod!\r\nSquidward: Please. I just want to get back... onto my side of boundary.\r\nSpongeBob: This, I cannot allow. It is against the rules.\r\nSquidward: But all I wanted was something to eat.\r\nPatrick: Did somebody say something to eat?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, look out!\r\nSquidward: Whoa!\r\nSquidward: My food!\r\nSpongeBob: Your food?\r\nPatrick: Hey, I want some too.\r\nSquidward: Is this what we've really come to? Is one little storm all it takes to turn us all into complete animals?\r\nSpongeBob: Apparently so. Well, that and a refrigerator full of food anyways.\r\nSquidward: Did you hear that?\r\nSpongeBob: It's just Patrick gnawing on his can.\r\nSquidward: No, no, no, no, no, no, not that. I mean from outside.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't hear anything.\r\nSquidward: The storm must've stopped.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, wait!\r\nSquidward: Woooo-hoooo! So long, suckers!\r\nSquidward: Oof!

We'll just see about that.\r\nPlankton: I knew this baby would come in handy.\r\nKaren: Uh-huh.\r\nPlankton: Turn on the navigation system, honey!

Now what?\r\nKaren: It appears that we've stumbled into a mishap.

And such steamy chumminess deserves recompense!\r\nPlankton: Oh, I'll take that!  Eat your blackened, twisted, money-grubbing heart out, Krabs!  I'm even profiting off of your most loyal ally!

Here are your Chum Nuggets, buddy.\r\nPatrick: Oh, I almost forgot! Here's your Chum Kebab!\r\nSpongeBob: Um, I guess you don't come down here for the food, anyways.

I've got cavern fever!\r\nMr. Krabs: Where have you been, and what is that ridiculous thing on your head?\r\nSpongeBob: It's a \"stalagmiter,\" available exclusively at the Chum Caverns Gift Shop.\r\nMr. Krabs: How dare you spend all the money I don't pay you at me arch-rival's business!

Alright, Krabs, if you think it's fair to undercut my business, then I'm gonna undercut you!\r\nPlankton: Heh, heh, heh! How does it feel, Krabs? Being in the hole, so to speak.

We're trapped down here. As in, there is no way out!\r\nPlankton: Ha! There may be no way out for you, Krabs, but you needn't worry about me!

Rochelle was just about to meet her biological parents!\r\nAmphitrite: Is this about turning 5,000 today?\r\nNeptune: No. Oh, my darling Amphitrite, it is not my age that troubles me so. It's that our son, Triton, will not be able to share in my revelry.\r\nAmphitrite: Let's forget about Triton for just one day. It's your 5,000th birthday, for shell's sake.\r\nNeptune: Ok. So long as there's no one careless enough to mention Triton.\r\nSpongeBob: Order up Squidward!  I'll bet you're wondering why I'm not using my hands today.\r\nSquidward: Not in the least, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: OK, OK, I'll tell you.\r\nSquidward: Your order, ma'am.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm not using my hands because today is \"Work Without Your Hands Day\".

She wants to have King Neptune's birthday party here.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh she does, does she? I'll handle this, laddie.  Yes, Queen Amphitrite.  Very convincing, but you're gonna have to call pretty early to fool ol' Eugene Krabs, PRANKSTER! . They think I was born yesterday. Aye-aye-aye. Does 7:00 work for you, your majesty?  Oil up yer spatula boy, for tonight you fry for a king.\r\nSpongeBob: So much for \"Work Without Your Hands Day,\" SquarePants. You answer to a higher calling this day. I have the capability!  OK, that's enough Patrick, thank you.\r\nMr. Krabs: You two really outdid yourselves. It almost makes me want to pay you.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like this area could use a few more decorations. Squidward!\r\nSquidward: Now, what?\r\nMr. Krabs: The decorations over here look a little sparse. Why don't you hang up a few balloons or something?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, that's better.

How goes it over here?\r\nSpongeBob: All set, Mr. K. 5,000 patties, one for every year Neptune's been alive.\r\nMr. Krabs: 5,000 patties at $3.99 a pop?\r\nMr. Krabs: Leave it to your old boss here to capitalize on such a momentous occasion.\r\nShubie: Wow! Why, you rolled out the red carpet!\r\nMr. Krabs: This ain't for you, lad. This is for King Neptune. Today is his birthday.\r\nShubie: Oh, uh, wait, King Neptune is coming here? Oh, I am a huge fan of the royal family. I just love everything they do. Could we please, maybe, watch them eat, right here through the window, you know?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't be ridiculous. Why in Neptune's name would I let you...\r\nMr. Krabs: See Neptune eat! Only five dollars! Only a few seats left!\r\nMr. Krabs: Thank you.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thank you.\r\nFish #19: You got change for a twenty?\r\nMr. Krabs: Nope, sorry. I guess that it's twenty dollars for for you then.

Is there a Triton here? Is there anybody missing from this party that any of you guys can see?\r\nAmphitrite: Nope, there's nobody missing, we're all here.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I was sure there's somebody.. Oh! Here it is right here. An empty seat.\r\nNeptune: That's not an empty seat. My wife is sitting there.\r\nSpongeBob: No, not that chair, your Highness. That one, see? It even has its pretty name card that I made still on it.\r\nNeptune: Oh no.\r\nSpongeBob: T-R-I-T-O-N. You sure you don't know anyone named Triton?  Should I put it down yes or no?\r\nAmphitrite: Triton is our son. But as you can see, the king doesn't want to talk about it right now.\r\nNeptune: Thank you, my darling. I'd rather not share with this addled mortal the woeful story of our son, Triton.  But I suppose I could tell it.  No, you're right, I won't tell it.  Instead, I'm going to show this movie I made about it.  Could someone please dim the lights?\r\nNeptune: It all started one day while giving Triton his smiting lessons.\r\nNeptune: That's how you strike fear into the hearts of your subjects! Now you try, son. Son?\r\nNeptune: Triton was increasingly fascinated with the miserable world of the lowly mortals.\r\nTriton: Dad, when are you going to teach me the ball and stick game?\r\nNeptune: Never. Now take hold of your trident and practice your smiting, son.\r\nTriton: I don't feel like smiting. I wanna play the ball and stick game.\r\nNeptune: OK, son, you want to learn the stick and ball game? Well here's your first lesson. Batter up.  It looks like I just hit a single. Let's see if you can get a home run, son.\r\nTriton: Leave me alone, Dad.\r\nNeptune: What was happening to my own flesh and blood? Over the next few millennia, my son grew not only in size, but in perplexing behavior.\r\nNeptune: What is going on in here?\r\nTriton: Hey, Dad, check it out! I'm studying chemistry, and I've just created a cure for all mortal diseases!\r\nNeptune: How many times do I have to tell you? We are gods! We don't have diseases, nor do we care whether or not the mortals contract them!\r\nTriton: Gosh!\r\nNeptune: Try as I might, it was becoming increasingly apparent that we would not agree on the ways of the world. I knew I had no choice. There was only one last resort.  No, not that one! The Island in the Sky.\r\nTriton: Isn't that island a miniature golf course?\r\nNeptune: No! The one on the other side of the river\r\nTriton: You mean the juvenile correction facility? But that place is for losers, man.\r\nNeptune: Uh-huh.\r\nTriton: Okay, I'm standing in here. Now what?  What are you doing? This is bogus!\r\nNeptune: I'm sealing you inside this magical shrinking cage until you learn to embrace your destiny as one of the gods!\r\nTriton: Noooooo!\r\nTriton: You call that shrinking?\r\nNeptune: Well, it only shrinks 7%.\r\nTriton: Man, that is just beyond bogus.\r\nNeptune: Perhaps in your eyes, it is beyond bogus, but it is the only way you'll learn.  Reflect on this for 10,000 years.\r\nTriton: You can't do this, man! I've got a life to live. I can't be stuck in this cage, man!  God. I hate you, old man, you hear me? I hate you!\r\nNeptune: And that's that.\r\nMr. Krabs: Huh? Okay, who's ready for a piping hot Krabby Patty? Would you like the first one, your highness?\r\nNeptune: Recounting this sad tale has upset me so much, I've lost my appetite.\r\nAmphitrite: Take those sandwiches away! Can't you see the king is upset?  It's okay, let it out.\r\nMale fish: This is a rip-off! I paid to watch high-class royal dining action, not listen to a boring sob story.\r\nMonica: Ooh, looks like things may be picking up! Royal violence!\r\nAmphitrite: Why have you not obeyed me, mortal? Be gone!\r\nMr. Krabs: So who's going to pay for these, then?\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh! If Neptune doesn't cheer up soon, me business is ruined.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh no. This is all my fault because I mentioned  Triton.\r\nSquidward: Well, it wouldn't be the first time you've ruined everything, but the worst part is those 5,000 Krabby Patties that will end up going rotten in the hot sun.\r\nSpongeBob: Stop, Squidward, please stop! Your descriptions are too horrifying for my delicate sensibilities.\r\nSquidward: I do have a way with words.\r\nNeptune: Oh, how I miss my son!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, that's it! I'll fix all this by reuniting Neptune with his son!\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks again, Mr. Bus Driver!\r\nSpongeBob: Now, all I've got to do is find King Neptune's long-lost son.\r\nMr. Krabs: Come on, Krabs! Think, think!  Ooh!\r\nSquidward: Whatever it is, no.\r\nMr. Krabs: Squidward, you're a man of culture.\r\nSquidward: Go on.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, these highfalutin' types, they might appreciate that, don't you think? Why don't you try and razzle-dazzle them with all your pizazz?\r\nSquidward: Pizazz. Hold on to your hats and glasses, people, because Squidward the Fantabulous has arrived.\r\nSquidward: Thank you. Thank you. This next one, I wrote myself. I like to call it, 'Three Barnacles are a Crowd Unless They've Known Each Other for a Really Long Time.'\r\nFrank: Things just got lame again.\r\nMonica: Yeah, well, they better get un-lame real quick, or I'm asking for my money back.\r\nFrank: No refunds!? Well, I guess we're stuck here, then.\r\nSpongeBob: What the—I had the strangest dream that I just got hit in the head with a tiny toenail clipping.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, I was right! It is a tiny toenail clipping.\r\nSpongeBob: Another one!  Plus some rope.\r\nTriton: Hey, man, what's the big idea?\r\nSpongeBob: Who said that? Show yourself! I'm warning you. I know how to use these!\r\nTriton: I'm down here, man!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, hello, little fella. Maybe you can help me. Because if I don't find Triton soon, Krabs is gonna be real upset, because he spent a lot of money on party decorations.\r\nTriton: Party decorations? For what?\r\nSpongeBob: For King Neptune's birthday!\r\nTriton: So, it's my old man's birthday. Big deal.\r\nSpongeBob: You mean, you're King Neptune's son?\r\nTriton: I am, but he doesn't seem to think so.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, he sure seemed upset that you weren't at his birthday party.\r\nTriton: Hah! That's a real good one, man. Real funny.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, thanks, but...\r\nTriton: Do you think if that old goat really cared, he'd have me sealed up in this magical cage with nothing to do all day  but trim my fingernails, man?\r\nSpongeBob: You're right. It just doesn't make any sense.\r\nTriton: You're telling me, man.\r\nSpongeBob: I mean, gods shouldn't have to use nail clippers. They should be able to wear their fingernails to whatever length they want!\r\nTriton: Man, you're just like all the rest.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't go.\r\nSpongeBob: What if there was a way to free you from this magical cage? Then, you could come to your father's birthday party and settle your differences!\r\nTriton: May I ask you to brush your teeth first, dude. P.U!\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, I haven't had anything to drink in a couple of days, my throats a little dry.\r\nTriton: This cage is only so big man\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, I'll stop talking, I swear\r\nTriton: Never mind, just undo the lock\r\nSpongeBob: boy this really does look complicated, oh I see, I'll just slide this square to the right, this one goes up, one other here and ohh wait, no, ahh, no squares  man that really is a tough nut to crack\r\nTriton: That lock was forged by the gods, not any numbskull can open like a cheap bag of potato chips they found in the street.\r\nSpongeBob: Cheap bag of potato choo wait a minute, which way to the nearest phone booth?\r\nTriton: Theres one behind that rock over there, but I don't see why...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Hey, you'll never guess what I found on the street  yeah, I'll hurry\r\nSpongeBob: Oh Patrick, you made it, this is the magical lock I was talking about,\r\nPatrick: Hmmm\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I tried for hours and hours but I just can't get it to...\r\nPatrick: Open!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow, all ready, Patrick you know I'll never figure out how you do those so darn fast.\r\nPatrick: I just peel the stickers of the squares and put them back on in the right spaces\r\nSpongeBob: Amazing!\r\nTriton: Say, now this silly old cage is open, why don't we pay my old man a visit.

Are ya, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: No. I'm won't let it get between me and those crisp onions, sweet tomatoes, fresh lettuce, a flame- broiled patty, a warm bun sprinkled with sesame seeds, served with a smile that says, \"Hey! I can!\" I'm ready!\r\nPatrick: That's the spirit!\r\nSpongeBob: Woo!  Don't worry, Patrick! My spirits are still high!\r\nSpongeBob: Hello, perfectly made Krabby Patty. Order's up!\r\nSquidward: It's about time.  Hey, SpongeBob, love the outfit. Where'd you get it, the hardware store?!  Hardware store!\r\nSpongeBob: Hardware store! No, from my bathroom.\r\nSquidward: Well, I must say, it really completes your imbecile look. Way to go, buddy.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, thanks, pal.\r\nSpongeBob: Ohh! Squidward!  Squidward!  Are you okay?\r\nSquidward: Please, just get away from me.\r\nCustomer: Excuse me, can I have a refill on my soda?\r\nSpongeBob: Ohh! A refill!\r\nCustomer: Oww! Oh, my foot! Oh, my foot!  Ow! My back!  My face!\r\nSpongeBob: Not to worry, sir. I'm comi-i-i-i-ing--  Whoa!  Don't worry, everybody, I'm ok-  Hey! Don't touch Mr. Krabs' money!\r\nMr. Krabs: Me money! What do you think you're doin'?  That ain't yours.  Thank you very much. When I get my hands on that boy...\r\nSpongeBob: Here, Mr. Krabs. I'll help.\r\nMr. Krabs: Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today.  And don't even think about coming back here until that destructive device of yours is gone!\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how was work?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, an absolute disaster. I can't do anything without this stupid wringer getting in the way. Patrick, I am nothing more than a-- a bike rack. A sad, sad, sad, sad little bike rack.\r\nPatrick: Hey! Don't you go crying on me!  Crying never solves anything. I know what always makes you feel better.\r\nSpongeBob: You were right! Ice cream always makes me feel better!\r\nPatrick: Dig in!\r\nSpongeBob: I can't even eat ice cream now! This dumb wringer's in the way!\r\nPatrick: Bummer. Hey, you know what? Forget this place. Let's go to the carnival. That's the funnest spot in the ocean.\r\nPatrick: Look! The ball toss!\r\nBall Toss Vendor: Step right up, folks! Toss a ball, hit the cans, and win a stuffed seahorse!\r\nPatrick: We wanna play!\r\nBall Toss Vendor: Sure. Gimme your best shot.\r\nPatrick: Thanks.  Woohoo!  Now you try.\r\nPatrick: Ohh! Oh! The spinning steering wheels! Oh, we gotta do that!\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know... I have too much eye pain.\r\nPatrick: Oh, come on! How many times does the carnival come to town?!  Ready?\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune! Why?!\r\nPatrick: Hey, pal, want some of my cotton candy? They gave it to me when I won the dart tournament. I got this, too!  Check it out!\r\nSpongeBob: That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.\r\nPatrick: Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.\r\nSpongeBob: I said I don't want any!\r\nPatrick: You ruined my cotton candy!\r\nSpongeBob: Good! Maybe now you know how I feel about you ruining my life!\r\nBall Toss Vendor: Check it out! Public fight!\r\nOther Vendor: Working at the carnival sure has its perks!\r\nSpongeBob: I have never felt so ashamed.\r\nPatrick: What do you mean?\r\nSpongeBob: If it wasn't for your Forever Glue, I wouldn't be stuck in this thing!\r\nPatrick: I was only trying to help.\r\nSpongeBob: Help?! I think you've helped quite enough today!\r\nPatrick: Okay, if that's how you feel... I won't help you anymore!\r\nSpongeBob: Heh, heh, a lot of drama with that one.\r\nSandals: Ya know, kid, your body isn't the problem. It's your heart.  You deserve what you've gotten. C'mon, we're out of here.  Some people are just born mean.\r\nPatrick: Forget SpongeBob, I don't need him.  I can do whatever I want!  I don't need him.  Forget it, you're not his friend anymore. I gotta keep myself occupied so I don't think about Sponge--  I'm not gonna even say his name! What to do, what to do... I know! I'll have a staring contest!  Ohh, fiddlesticks. That game's too hard.\r\nPatrick in a Thought Bubble: Maybe if SpongeBob was here, he could give you pointers.\r\nPatrick: Who asked you?!  Forget it! I'll just play...uh... fetch!  Where is it? Where is it? Gotcha!  Is SpongeBob okay? Oh, what do I care? I'm no longer supposed to help.  Buddy!  Uhh! SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Hey, whatcha watchin'?\r\nSpongeBob: My favorite show.  Ha, ha, I love that part!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob! Snap out of it! It's me, your best friend, Patrick!\r\nSpongeBob: What's that? I can't hear you what with all the lonely voices in my head.\r\nPatrick: Oh, man, he's too far gone.\r\nSpongeBob: Not fit to live in society...\r\nPatrick: This is all my fault!  Me and my dumb ideas! I'm so sorry!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Your tears! They're melting the glue! Keep crying! I'll do the same and maybe I can slip out of this thing!  Look! It worked!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: All right!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess crying does solve your problems after all.  Come here, buddy!\r\nPatrick: Well, at least we're together! Heh.

I'd be much obliged to know how y'all make one of them there patties.\r\nSpongeBob: Hohohoho. No can do, buddy. That would require revealing the secret formula. And that is explicitly forbidden as per my current labor contract.\r\nPlankton: Yeah, but this is yer old buddy Sandy Cheeks.  Why, you and me are as closer 'n two catfish in a skillet.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, Sandy, 44-929b specifically prohibits the disclosure of the secret formula to friends, even when those friends are, quote, \"closer 'n two catfish in a skillet.\"\r\nPlankton: Curse you, Krabs...!\r\nSpongeBob: But I can show you all the other ins and outs of making a steamy Krabby Patty. First, I make sure I'm at the comfortable grilling temperature of 274 degrees.\r\nSpongeBob: And we are guh-rillin'.\r\nPlankton: An' approximately how long do you cook a patty?\r\nSpongeBob: A Krabby Patty is cooked for exactly 283 seconds on each side.\r\nPlankton: 283 seconds. I can't believe I'm getting all this straight from the source. How could this get any easier?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm puttin' the secret Krabby Patty formula out in plain sight.\r\nPlankton: Yee-haw!\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah... Anyway, I'm gonna leave it out here while I clean out the safe. Don't let it out of your sight, boy-o.\r\nSpongeBob: You can always count on me, Mr. K.\r\nPlankton: Oh-ho ho, man! That secret formula is as good as mine.\r\nSandy: That no-good who nabbed my pelt surely came here. Probably wanted to cash it in on the Bikini Bottom black market. Well, not if I catch that varmint first.\r\nSandy: You! You seen anybody in these parts haulin' a fur pelt?\r\nHarold: Look! A naked chipmunk!\r\nSandy: Chipmunk?! What is so funny about havin' my fur stole?\r\nRandom Fish: Aren't you ashamed of having your pink rat flesh exposed?\r\nEveryone: Yeah!\r\nSandy: With this much attention, that no-good fur thief will see me comin' a mile away. I best find somethin' to cover my hind end.\r\nSandy: Time to go catch me some skunk!\r\nSpongeBob: Now that we're grillin', we can work on the fixin's! See, there are two patties here. But before we get into slicing and dicing we always start with the washing. We'll begin with the seaweed.\r\nPlankton: Okay, I'll stand on thata' side for a better view.\r\nSpongeBob: Okey dokey, but pay close attention, for cleanliness is the public's last defense against a life of horrible disease.\r\nPlankton: There it is.\r\nSpongeBob: Always ensure that your brush is adequately lathered....Always making sure to get both sides...\r\nPlankton: That's nice. That's interestin'.\r\nPlankton: Almost there...\r\nSpongeBob: Then lay it down onto the drying rack and we'll engage our drying phase, hmm.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy!\r\nPlankton: What, nothin'!\r\nSpongeBob: Remember, never overdry. Otherwise, the seaweed becomes brittle and cracks.\r\nSandy: That dastardly rustler's got to be somewhere in these parts.\r\nPolice: Hey, look! A hairless goat!\r\nSpongeBob: Steady, steady... Nice. Oh, you're off-center by 3.6 millimeters. Mmmph, try it again, Sandy.\r\nPlankton: Aaugh! This is getting so tedious!\r\nPlankton/Sandy Robot: Maybe you should demonstrate a few more times so I can get the hang of it.\r\nSpongeBob: Or, we could address your problem areas directly. Are you struggling with the final wrist flick? Or is your difficulty with the initial transfer move?\r\nPlankton: Gah!\r\nSandy: I'm tired of running. Time to take a stand.\r\nRandom Fish: A nudist ferret!\r\nFish: Get in the car, kids!\r\nSandy: It's not my fault! I...\r\nSandy: I better go underground.\r\nSandy: What am I gonna do?

Oh, try again.\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, try again.\r\nPlankton: Arrrgghh! You try it again! I'm makin' my move!\r\nPlankton: It's finally mine!

We'll see about that.  Keep the grill goin' nonstop to crank out as much grease as possible!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay ,Mr. Krabs. I never turn the grill off, but I can turn it off even less than that if you want.\r\nMr. Krabs: Uhh... I already see the...  Whoa!  Gribbets Mollusk!  Eeeagh! What in the name of Neptune is this?\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry Mr. Krabs. I accidentally dropped some buns into our vat of extra grease. They've been soakin' there for about an hour.\r\nPlankton: Yummy Bunz huh? Well you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that Krabs, once the hungry public hears about MY newest creation.\r\nKaren: Creation? My scanner shows that's nothing more than a burnt grease crumb.\r\nPlankton: You're right! And it's packed with flavor!\r\nSquidward: P.U, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: Huh?\r\nSquidward: Don't you usually flush that stuff down the toilet?\r\nMr. Krabs: This is our latest product! It's pure grease on a paper plate!\r\nSquidward: I'll give you points for honesty.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Get those seven orders of Wow soup out to table 3 pronto! We gotta keep these customers happy or Plankton will steal them back!\r\nFrank: Are you going to eat that?\r\nSpongeBob: It was supposed to be going to table 3.\r\nFrank: Okay.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Sir yes sir!\r\nMr. Krabs: Are you gonna get that soup served to table 3 or are you gonna wait til it gets up and walks there itself?\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, Mr. Krabs, I've been thinking. And well, don't you think maybe this whole grease thing has gone a bit to far?\r\nMr. Krabs: You know what I think SpongeBob? I think you should be thinking about NOT thinking and get back to work!\r\nPatrick: Gotta... Have... Crunchity... Munchities...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Oh no! Not my best friend, too!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?!\r\nPlankton: Oh no! Did somebody call the health inspector?\r\nHealth inspector: Did somebody call a... Health inspector?\r\nSpongeBob: It was me sir. I just wanted to tell you that... Well, for the past two weeks, Plankton and Mr. Krabs have been...  they've been feeding people grea...  they've been feeding people...\r\nHealth inspector: What is going on here?\r\nMr. Krabs: Nothing, Mr. Inspector.\r\nSpongeBob: They've been feeding people...\r\nPlankton: Just a friendly competition between old...\r\nMr. Krabs and Plankton: F-f-f-f-f-\r\nPlankton: Friends?\r\nMr. Krabs: Friends, right.\r\nSpongeBob: They're feeding people grease!\r\nHealth inspector: Well! I thought I recognized this horrible stench. But I thought that maybe just one of you two hadn't showered in a while.\r\nPlankton: Uh, Officer! Officer I would just like to state for the record that umm,  this was all his idea! All of it!\r\nHealth inspector: Oh, really? Well, in that case, you'll be happy to know I'll be ordering BOTH of your restaurants to be closed down until the two of you slime balls can clean up your act!

It was all a dream!\r\nSpongeBob: No it wasn't, Mr. Krabs! I soaked up all the offending substances from the surrounding area and I'm gonna go dispose of them properly.

I need to start fresh.  With a job that feels...natural. Something that says, \"This is a job for a sponge.\" Any idea where I can find a job like that, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: No. Oh, but, yes! It's so obvious! You should work at the Krusty Krab. They need a fry cook!\r\nSpongeBob: I can't, Patrick. That's the job I got fired from, remember?\r\nPatrick: Ohhh. Mayhaps you should talk to the sponge behind you. He looks happy.\r\nSpongeBob: That's just a billboard, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Why don't you get a job as a billboard?\r\nSpongeBob: I...don't think that's physically possible,  but I could audition to be a sponge model.\r\nPatrick: Fine, do it your way.\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! What a setup! Oh, I don't know, Patrick. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe I don't have the talent.\r\nPatrick: Oh, you have the talent.

And you'd like to upgrade to the toy package is that right?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't have any toys.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, really?  Then what do you call?... this?\r\n.\r\nPatrick and SpongeBob: Gasp!\r\nSpongeBob: An officially \"licensed\" Krusty Krab toy? .\r\n.\r\nSpongeBob: My purpose in life is to have you as my toy. .\r\nMr. Krabs: Eww.

Have you met my new toy?\r\nPatrick: Don't you mean \"our\" new toy?\r\nSpongeBob: Our new toy?\r\nPatrick: It came from the meal that we're \"sharing.\"\r\nSpongeBob: Sharing?\r\nPatrick: Remember?  Sharing is the most wonderful feeling in the world, like dancing with a magical seahorse through an enchanted kelp garden  Remember those words, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: I didn't say that. But I guess we can share Patty Pal.  Now can I see it again, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: I thought we were sharing it?\r\nSpongeBob: When's my turn?\r\nPatrick: Aren't you supposed to be working?\r\nSpongeBob: Of course.\r\nSpongeBob: Now is it my turn?\r\nPatrick: No.\r\nSpongeBob: How about now?\r\nPatrick: Nah, maybe tomorrow.\r\nSpongeBob: Nighty-night, Patty Pal.\r\nPatrick: No touching! See you tomorrow.  Say good night, Patty Pal.  Good night, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Good night.  Poor Patrick. He's only got the Patty Pal for tonight, and he'll be asleep, and won't get to play with it at all!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes! Today's my Patty Pal day! Oh, this is going to be fun!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, of course, Patrick will give me my turn with the Patty Pal!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Gary, you can be a real negative nancy!\r\nGary: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: I heard that!  Good Morning, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Uh, I'm not home right now! Please leave a message! Beeeep!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, it's me! SpongeBob!

Y'all best sit down and work this out. Now the main problem in an argument is a lack of communication. You can only resolve conflict when you understand each other.  So I want each of you to state what is most important to the each of you right now.\r\nSpongeBob: Water?!\r\nPatrick: Oh boy.\r\nSpongeBob: That mediator lady made some good points.\r\nPatrick: Most definitely.\r\nSpongeBob: It takes understanding.\r\nPatrick: Communication is key.\r\nSpongeBob: It's my turn!\r\nPatrick: No, it's mine!\r\nSpongeBob: Mine!\r\nPatrick: If I can't have it, no one can!\r\nSpongeBob: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\r\nMr. Krabs: Avast, there, laddies. What's all this ruckerus about now?\r\nSpongeBob: It's our Krabby Patty toy, Mr. Krabs, and Patrick ate it, so that I couldn't play with it.\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob won't let me play with it.\r\nSpongeBob: Only because you hogged it all night.\r\nPatrick: I did not!\r\nSpongeBob: Did too!\r\nPatrick: Nuh-uh!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, you toy eater!\r\nPatrick: Tattletale!\r\nMr. Krabs: Whoa, whoa, whoa there, now, settle down. All this brawling is over a toy? You two shouldn't let a little trinket get between youse. You should be ashamed of yourselves. If I gave each of ya another toy, would that make you happy?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yes.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, you're in luck! You two seem so thrilled with the toy. I had an entire case of 'em made. They've been selling my hotcakes. That'll be $13.50 each.\r\nPatrick: This time, it's on me.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, that's my money.\r\nPatrick: Have you learned nothing about sharing?\r\n`;\r\nexport default data;","const data =\r\n`132b\r\nKracked Krabs\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, one extra large order of sea fries.\r\nSpongeBob: And...\r\nSquidward: Please.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?\r\nSquidward: Yes.

That outstretched hand is one of the biggest dangers to becoming a true cheapskate: He wants a tip.\r\nSpongeBob: What's a tip?\r\nMr. Krabs: It means he wants money for nothing.  So watch closely.  There ye are, lad.\r\nEmployee: Wow. A quarter. You, sir, are a real cheapskate.\r\nMr. Krabs: Why, thank you!  Now watch closely, boy! You give it a little lean, and then... snatch it back!\r\nEmployee: Oh. Like I haven't seen that gag ten times today.\r\nMr. Krabs: Go ahead! Give it a try!\r\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, sir!  Here you are, sonny! A nice, shiny-  quarter.\r\nMr. Krabs: Go on, boy! The quarter's getting away!\r\nMr. Krabs: Quit foolin' around!

We will now hear a testimony from a Krusty Krab employee!\r\nMr. Krabs: I need ya to testify about how cheap I am! So if you need to do a little exaggeratin'...  Ye not getting it, are ye?  Exaggeratin' is like tellin' the truth, only with little lies sprinkled in to make it, uh... true...er.\r\nSpongeBob: You're teaching me to lie?! Lying is wrong, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: No, no, no, no, no, no, exaggeratin's completely different from lyin'. You're taking the truth, and just seasoning it with little lies. I mean, just because you put salt on a Krabby Patty... it doesn't make it a salty patty. Does it?\r\nSpongeBob: No.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, good enough. Just make sure you exaggerate enough fer me to win!\r\nSpongeBob: Um, uh, ugh, uh...

About me being cheap!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs is... a very generous pointer.\r\nMr. Krabs: No, no, no, no, exaggerate the other way!\r\nSpongeBob: Um, he's not doing it for the money. He is doing it for his loyal employees.  Vacation time, regular raises, profit sharing. To Mr. Krabs, he's such a little gift that he's to glad to give us, so that he can see the looks on our faces when he hands us our paychecks.\r\nJudge: We've heard enough.  Disqualified!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, Mr. Krabs, you left some bitter tears on the night vent.\r\nMr. Krabs: Thanks.\r\nSpongeBob: Cheer up, Mr. Krabs. You may have not won the award, but you taught this sponge a lot about stinginess. Ooh! I almost forgot to pack these hotel toiletries!  And let's not forget these hotel towels!\r\nMr. Krabs: But...but isn't that stealing?\r\nSpongeBob: Stealing? Phhhht! We're exaggerating!\r\nMr. Krabs: Heh heh. Well, could we \"exaggerate\" this pillow, too?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, only if you help me \"exaggerate\" this air conditioner!\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure, boy! But why not \"exaggerate\" the whole wall?  Well, I didn't win the award, but it's been nice exaggeratin' with you, boy.\r\nEmployee: Do you have any hotel property in this bag?\r\nJudge: Preposterous! This is all mine!\r\nMr. Krabs: Heh heh heh. Looks like he bit off more than he could chew.\r\nJudge: You took the entire hotel room?\r\nSpongeBob: Duh!

This one's a five-spot.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, guess what?\r\nPatrick: You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, yes, how did you guess?\r\nPatrick: Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself.\r\nSpongeBob: Let's just start with the song.\r\nPatrick: You mean \"The Jellyfishing Song\"?\r\nSpongeBob: That's the one.\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: ♪Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jellyfishing song!♪ ♪Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everybody sing along!♪ ♪I go jellyfishing in da' morn'in,♪\r\nPatrick: ♪I jellyfish all da' night!♪\r\nSpongeBob: ♪I jellyfish all da' afternoon,♪\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: ♪Jellyfishing make me feel all right!♪\r\nCoral: ♪Everybody singgggggggggggggggg♪\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: ♪Everybody sing along!♪\r\nSpongeBob: Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?\r\nPatrick: You bet! And it's highway convenient, too, according to that big sign!\r\nSpongeBob: Big sign? I didn't see a big sig-Jumping Jellyfish! That's a big sign!\r\nPatrick: It says, \"Future site of the Shelly Super Highway.\"\r\nSpongeBob: Super highway!? Do you know what this means?!\r\nPatrick: Well, it’s sorta like other roads, except there's no sto-\r\nSpongeBob: I know what a superhighway is! I mean for all this jellyfish! For us! For Jellyfish Fiel--ds, uh, sorry.\r\nPatrick: So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single species of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, yeah, that's a simplified version, but yeah, something like that,  which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, \"Shelly Super Highway,\" from ever being built!\r\nLarry: 1,397, 1,398--  Whoa!\r\nSpongeBob: Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!\r\nLarry: Can't right now, bro.

Ahoy!\r\nSpongeBob: Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy.\r\nMr. Krabs: Why, SpongeBob, that's not your usual four-fingered salute.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?\r\nSpongeBob: Really, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure, why not?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, why?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh, well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see fo yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!\r\nSpongeBob: Charts and dia- Mr. Krabs! Didn't you see!?  After the Shelly Superhighway goes right through Jellyfish Fields, it goes right over the Krusty Krab! Gee, there you are, decrepit and living in a cardboard box! Then, it does a loop-de-loop for some reason, and goes right through the front door of the Chum Bucket!\r\nMr. Krabs: What!? Who approved this plan!?\r\nSpongeBob: \"Plan approved by & sponsored by Sheldon J. Plankton Enterprises, a division of No Fun Incorporated!\"\r\nMr. Krabs: C'mon, boy! Let's you and I go over and show that Plankton a piece of our minds!\r\nSpongeBob: Think this piece will get the point across?\r\nMr. Krabs: Alright, Plankton! It's Eugene Krabs, here, with, What's-His-Name!

Open your eyes, for cryin' out loud!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, sorry.\r\nPlankton: Now what's this all about, anyway?\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't play coy with us, Shelly. We both know you've been up to no good. Now start talking.\r\nPlankton: All right, so I've been stealing your mail for the past five years, big whoop.\r\nSpongeBob: Not that!\r\nMr. Krabs: What? You've been what?\r\nSpongeBob: We're talking about that new superhighway you're planning on building, and in case you didn't know, it's gonna destroy Jellyfish Fields. Not to mention that your plan is stupid and dumb and dumb and stupid.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait a minute. You've been what?\r\nPlankton: Well, that certainly was an interesting series of words that just tumbled out past your teeth and lips, but frankly, my dear sponge, I don't give a barnacle.\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nMr. Krabs: I don't know.\r\nPlankton: Forget it. Even if I wanted to the Shelly Superhighway from being built, it would be impossible.\r\nSpongeBob: Why?\r\nPlankton: Because the whole city has already approved it! See for yourself, through this conveniently-timed flashback.\r\nMayor: Order. Order. Order in the Meeting Hall.  Now all those in favor of paving over Jellyfish Fields and building the Shelly Superhighway, raise your right fin and say \"aye.\"\r\nEveryone: Aye!\r\nFish 1: I like highways.\r\nFish 2: I like things that are super.\r\nMr. Krabs: And I like saying, \"aye.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, why did I say \"aye\"?\r\nPlankton: Seems as though the ayes have it. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got superhighway preparations to be attending to.

As I was saying, today marks a new beginning for Bikini Bottom!  Now, it’s time to pave our way down the road to success!  Ah, I love the smell of hot tar in the morning! Yeah, baby!  Hey, you there! Are you trying to get yourself crushed!?\r\nSpongeBob: I won't let you do it, Plankton! If you're going to pave over Jellyfish Fields, you're going to have to pave over me first!\r\nPlankton: Ooh! Your wish is my command, Sponge!\r\nSpongeBob: Is that all you got?\r\nSpongeBob: Knock it off, Patrick.\r\nMr. Krabs: I used to dream of me restaurant have an \"easy highway access!\"\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but this is more like \"highway excess!\"\r\nSquidward: Well, I'm going to go soak my tentacles.  It's cold in here underneath all of this concrete!\r\nMr. Krabs: But, Squidward, we can't leave! What if we have, a customer?\r\nSquidward: Really. We haven't had a customer since the day this highway was built!\r\nSpongeBob: uh, Squidward, it's technically its a super-highway.\r\nSquidward: I don't care what it is! I'm out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: But, Squidward-\r\nMr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob. Squidward's right.  It's high time we started accepting facts.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm on it, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: No, boyo!

And more importantly, how does it affect me!?\r\nMr. Krabs: Plan Zed-9er9er is, I'm- I'm- I'm selling the Krabby Patty secret formula to Plantkon!\r\nSquidward: Eugene!\r\nMr. Krabs: I have no choice.

She got in!\r\nKaren: What are you talking about?\r\nPlankton: There's a whale in the laboratory!\r\nKaren: Are you out of your mind?\r\nPlankton: See for yourself!\r\nKaren: No whale in here.\r\nPlankton: I swear! A whale was just in here. She was next to the transmutator. She was right here in this spot! Her mouth all frothy, her blowhole blowing!\r\nKaren: Oh that's enough Plankton! If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to more permanent primary functions.\r\nPlankton: Karen! Karen--!\r\nKaren: I'm not listening! Hm hm hm!\r\nNarrator: 16 paranoia filled days later...\r\nKaren: Plankton, your dinner is ready. Plankton? Plankton, do you hear me?\r\nPlankton: Yes, Karen. I can hear you. Could you please bring it up? I can't risk stepping into the light. The whale might see me.\r\nPlankton: Hey! Get me out of here!\r\nGrand-Dad: Hey Plankton! Glad you could join the rest of the family!\r\nPlankton: Grand-Dad?\r\nGrand-Dad: Yep, and you're pretty brave standing in that there gastric acid.\r\nPlankton: Gastric acid?  No!  I can't take it! Oh, this is driving me crazy!\r\nPlankton: What's the point of going on? I'll just be tortured for the rest of my life by that whale!  That's it. I'm done. The 4:15 bus should be here any time now.\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Plankton. Whatchya doin' laying on the middle of the road?\r\nPlankton: Go away, CheeseHead! Can't you see I'm trying to get run over? In fact, better yet just step on me as hard as you can, will ya?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, but that flies in the face of my good nature.\r\nPlankton: Forget it kid. I'll just wait for the next bus. Go on back to the Krusty Krab and enjoy yourself.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay!\r\nMr. Krabs: Goodbye, Pipsqueak!\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry to interrupt your gloating sir, I just thought it would be pertinent for you to know that Plankton is laying on the street, forlorn.\r\nMr. Krabs: Really? He's a mess!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are both sworn enemies and all, but putting on a dress to frighten him? Isn't that taking it a little too far?\r\nMr. Krabs: May I remind you of the fact that you've disclosed the location of me safe, where I keep the secret formula?\r\nSpongeBob: No need to remind me, sir. I've broken Rule #2 of the Krusty Krab Rule Book: Never disclose the location of the secret formula! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll fix this.\r\nPlankton: Man, what does it take to get run over around here?!\r\nSpongeBob: Hi, Plankton.\r\nPlankton: What, do you have mud in your ears? Take a hike!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, I remember. But, I just wanted to tell that the secret formula is not, I repeat not, in the safe behind the painting in the Krusty Krab.\r\nPlankton: What difference does it make? There's no point ever since I've been tortured by that blasted whale.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't worry. Everyone has a secret fear! For instance, Mr. Krabs' secret fear is...\r\nPlankton: Really?\r\nSpongeBob: Mmm-hmm, and guess what else? It was Mr. Krabs in whale suit that you've been scared of.\r\nPlankton: You mean this entire time it's been Krabs masquerading as a whale!?  Why that conniving bottom feeder!\r\nSpongeBob: But, certainly you wouldn't have use for such, innocuous information, would you?\r\nPlankton: No, of course not.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, back to your self-destructive behavior, Plankton. Thank you for this talk!\r\nPlankton: No, no. Thank you!\r\nMr. Krabs: This is almost too fun!  Plankton ain't even a challenge no more!\r\nPlankton: Oh, is that so.\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Plankton. Back for more, aren'y ya? Okay, here it goes.  Boo!\r\nPlankton: You don't scare me, Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: I ain't Krabs, I'm... uh, I mean...  I'm Pearl, not Krabs.\r\nPlankton: The jig is up, Krabs. I know all about the suit, AND your secret fear!\r\nMr. Krabs: Secret fear?  What are you talkin' about?\r\nPlankton: See for yourself.  Enjoy the show!\r\nMr. Krabs: No. No. Muh-muh-make it stop! Please!\r\nPlankton: Doesn't feel so good on the other end of the stick, doesn't it scaredy pants? I feel wonderful!\r\nSpongeBob: Um, Plankton, if I were you I wouldn't be so smug.\r\nPlankton: Why not?\r\nSpongeBob: Because a hungry pod of whales just showed up for its early feeding.\r\nPlankton: Ahhhh! Not another feeding! Get me out of here!\r\nMr. Krabs: Whew! You really redeemed yourself boy!

How about we look through some old family photo albums?  Here's a picture of me when I developed my first appendage.  Pretty neat photo album, eh, Double-G Grammyma?\r\nPlankton: It was certainly interesting, but I'd like to hear about your more recent affairs, like where you work, for instance.\r\nSpongeBob: Ha, ha, ha, ha, don't worry.

And they pulled the plug.  The entire ocean rusted in the drain and sucked those two kids right down.  The drain was so powerful, it pulled all of Bikini Bottom into its gaping maw, causing an apocalypse to the sea!  And nobody was ever heard from...again.\r\nSpongeBob: Where is the Main Drain, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, it right, I...I don't know where it is, and I'm certainly not going to tell you.

We'll just whip up a new batch, like we did in the old days.\r\nMr. Krabs: I know this process like the back of me claw.  We always start with...  ...flour.  Next, we add  barnacle shavings. It's like riding a boat-cycle, ain't it, boy?\r\nSpongeBob: You never forget, boss man.\r\nMr. Krabs: What do ya say we do the next one together, eh?\r\nMr. Krabs: Sea Salt.\r\nSpongeBob: Turmeric.\r\nMr. Krabs: What are you on about, boy? Third step's always sea salt.\r\nSpongeBob: That's funny, I remember turmeric third. And doesn't the recipe call for land salt?\r\nMr. Krabs: It's sea salt. And don't you remember SCABS?\r\nSpongeBob: Scabs, sir?\r\nYeah, SCABS. You know,  \"salt comes after barnacle shavings.\"  Or was it LESIONS? Or wait...  No, that doesn't sour right either.\r\nSpongeBob: Was it pustule?\r\nMr. Krabs: Heavens, no. That's disgusting. All right, tell you what, why don't I just go fetch the formula?

Earlier today, Mr. Eugene Krabs, proprietor of the Krusty Krab restaurant, parted  with his beloved secret formula. We now go to Perch Perkins live on the scene.\r\nPerch Perkins: Thanks, Elaine. Just moments ago, Eugene Krabs sent his famously delicious secret Krabby Patty formula packing.\r\nMr. Krabs: Take care of yourself, little formula.\r\nSpongeBob: Good-bye, secret recipe!\r\nPerch Perkins: We wanted to ask Mr. Eugene Krabs  what compelled him to take such drastic measures.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, it's simple, Perch.  It seems keeping me secret formula in hand has proven to be all too temptin' for a  certain diminutive one-eyed criminal element of society.\r\nSo, I finally got him in full retreat.\r\nMr. Krabs: All right, boy, let's get back to making them patties.\r\nSpongeBob: I believe we were at turmeric.\r\nMr. Krabs: Boy, I thought I told you--\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, no we forgot to look at the...\r\nMr. Krabs: Formula, yeah.\r\nSpongeBob: And that formula is...\r\nMr. Krabs: On the opposite side of the ocean, yeah.  And now I've gotta go  all  the way  there  to  get it.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'll do it. Send me to retrieve that formula.\r\nMr. Krabs: Think you're up for the challenge?\r\nSpongeBob: Uh-huh.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, all right then,  the formula is now stowed in a safe-deposit box in the ocean's largest, safest bank  in Way-far-out-town-ville.\r\nSpongeBob: Ah, and that's the key to the box, eh, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: This, No. This is the key to me heart?

All this suspicious thing is making me hungry.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, then follow me to the dining car.\r\nPlankton: Looks like it's starting to roll my way for a change. And nothing dares stand in my way!  Uh-oh.  I knew I'd make it...\r\nSpongeBob: Ooh Fancy.\r\nPatrick : Yeah.

Well no offense, but I don't believe you.\r\nPlankton: You calling me a liar?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes. Search him, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: With pleasure. Prepare for a thorough search, shorty.\r\nPlankton: Oh, drat.\r\nPatrick: Just after I scrub this bowl.  Alright, Plankton, time to squeeze the key out of you.  After my tasty snack.  He's clean.\r\nPlankton: I told you I wasn't lying.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, if you didn't steal it, then who did? It must've been someone on this train. Patrick, call the cops.\r\nPatrick: Cops, I need you!\r\nCrowd: We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties! We want Krabby Patties!

No need to get excited now.\r\nCustomer: We want our patties, man.\r\nSquidward: That's Krusty Krab property.  That's a load-bearing column.  Hurry, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: As you know, an unspeakable crime has been committed here today and each of you have the means to do it. The question is who? You there, you're not fooling me with that innocent act.  Where were you at 6:42pm on the night of January 16? And don't give me that goo-goo-ga-ga stuff.\r\nPlankton: Oh brother.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Police Commissioner?\r\nCommissioner: Yes, Mr. SquarePants?\r\nSpongeBob: I sub--  I submit to you that the perpetrator of this heinous theft is none other than...the nanny.\r\nNanny: I haven't stolen a thing.\r\nSpongeBob: Sir, if you search this baby's diaper, you'll find the stolen key.\r\nCommissioner: Yes, Mr. SquarePants.  Aha!\r\nSpongeBob: The key!\r\nCommissioner: At least I found it. Thank you, Mr. SquarePants. You uncovered Neptune's jewel of the sea and nabbed the infamous Jewel Triplets Gang.\r\nSpongeBob: Triplets?\r\nBaby Triplet: I told you taking the train was a mistake.\r\nTriplet #2: Well, we wouldn't be on the lam if you hadn't applied for that discount card.\r\nBaby Triplet: Well, can I help it if I'm frugal?\r\nCommissioner: Tell it to your cellmate, junior.\r\nSpongeBob: If they didn't do it...that means the key was stolen by...the butler.\r\nOran J. Roughy: I certainly did not.\r\nSpongeBob: We know you did it. The butler always commits the crime.\r\nOran J. Roughy: For the last time, I am not a butler. I don't even have the butler accent.\r\nPatrick: You may not be a butler, but are you a werewolf?\r\nPlankton: Okay, butler, you may have hoodwinked the sponge, but I ain't no pushover!\r\nPatrick: Sorry.\r\nPlankton: Anyway, since you didn't steal the key, then you'd obviously submit to a search of your cabin.\r\nOran J. Roughy: I do not have a cabin. I sleep on the luggage.\r\nPlankton: Aha, that's how you stole it! Give it to me. Give me the key.\r\nSpongeBob: Need I remind you, Plankton, that you are still a suspect yourself.\r\nPlankton: Uh, I-I mean, give SpongeBob back the key.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't believe either of you. Shake 'em down.\r\nKeystone Cop: Nothing suspicious here.  Except for the fact that you just outed Oran J. Roughy, international fugitive wanted for the embezzlement of over 75,000 bucks worth of ham sandwiches.\r\nSpongeBob: After all this, I still haven't found the key and I broke my vow to Mr. Krabs.  I don't deserve to work at the Krusty Krab.\r\nPatrick: Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure it'll turn up.\r\nSpongeBob: The key! Patrick! Where in the ocean's depth did you find it?\r\nPatrick: I found it when I was cleaning your shorts from your little \"accident\" earlier.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, that is great news.\r\nPatrick: Anyways, I'm gonna hit the sack. I'm pooped. I'm sure you can relate.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, yeah, me, too.\r\nPlankton: Me, three.\r\nPatrick: Say, would you mind scooching over? I can't even move my eyebrows.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm trying. Sheesh, this isn't exactly a luxury suite.\r\nPlankton: Here, maybe I can help.\r\nSpongeBob: Fresh water.\r\nPatrick: What a cool view.\r\nPlankton: Yeah, have a better look.  And thanks for the key!\r\nPatrick: Well, I guess he lost us. You ready to call it a day, SpongeBob?  Guess not.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, on the count of three, we'll jump on, okay?\r\nPatrick: Gotcha, pal. Oh, wait, I can't count that high. Can we just jump on the count of one?\r\nSpongeBob: That'll work, too. Okay, on the count of one—what the?\r\nPatrick: Great, now what?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, hop up on my back.\r\nPatrick: Well, I don't think this is the right time for a piggyback ride.\r\nSpongeBob: Just do it.\r\nPatrick: Okay.

Oh, Plankton!\r\nPatrick: You can't hide forever.\r\nPlankton: Looks like you've got a lot on your mind.\r\nSpongeBob: Alright, Plankton, end of the line!  Plankton!\r\nPlankton: Over here, choo-choo heads.\r\nPatrick: That was odd.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, and Plankton still has the key.  Patrick, we've got a big problem.

Go see if you can do something with that stuff. I'll try and get the door open.\r\nPatrick: What do I do? What do I do?  B-R-A-K-E. BRAKE. I can do that. Well, SpongeBob, I think our troubles are over.\r\nSpongeBob: You broke the brake?\r\nPatrick: It told me to.\r\nSpongeBob: What do we do now?  Oh, one of these thingama-hoozies has to stop the train. Patrick, try something!\r\nPatrick: I'm on it.  Maybe shoveling in these black rocks will help.\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: We're on an out-of-control train!\r\nMan: This is control station to engine five. Do you copy?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, uh, yes, sir. I copy.

And Patrick's here, too. Say hi to the nice gentleman, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, the back of the train is gone!\r\nMan: Oh, no.  The train's headed straight for the rest home.  And that means...\r\nSpongeBob: Means what? Means what? What does that mean, mister?\r\nMan: It means that train's coming right through that--  Beware the twisted trestles, kid!\r\nSpongeBob: What is that?\r\nMan: That's that.\r\nSpongeBob & Patrick: That was fun.\r\nPatrick: Now, where were we?

Yeah.\r\nMr. Krabs: Sure. I believe ya.  Say, since you went through all the trouble of getting here, there you go, Plankton.  Enjoy the scenery. Hey, where'd he go?\r\nPlankton: Checkmate, Krabs!  Ow.\r\nMr. Krabs: Good job, boyo.\r\nSpongeBob: I simply refused to fail, sir.\r\nBank Teller: That's all very wonderful, but do you mind telling me how you intend to pay for the damage to the bank?\r\nMr. Krabs: Uh... You know, I just remembered, I'm late for a very important meetin'. Take care of it, will ya boy?\r\nBank Teller: Not so fast, Krabs. Looks like you have just enough in your bank account to cover the cost.\r\nMr. Krabs: No...!\r\nNarrator: 75 years later...\r\nSpongeBob: And that was the story of the great train caper.

You know, this one time I was upset because my snail Gary he was sick and he let me leave 5 minutes early. Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard?  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\r\nNarrator: Two very boring minutes later...\r\nSpongeBob: And theeeen, there was that time that Mr. Krabs yelled at me for getting to work before he did, and he didn't even dock my pay. What a sweet man!\r\nPearl: You are making this ride even more boring! Is such a thing is possible!\r\nSpongeBob: You're supposed to remain seated until the ride's come to a COMPLEEETE-  Stop!\r\nPearl: What was that?!\r\nVoice over Microphone: Attention sweethearts! We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain seated.\r\nPearl: Oh, great! Just great!\r\nNarrator: Three hours later...\r\nPerch Perkins: Breaking News! The Tunnel of Glove has turned into a Tunnel of Terror! Just hours ago, the mechanism that controls the boats mysteriously stopped, trapping the doomed couple inside. We have the youth's friends here, who escaped the tunnel before tragedy befell the two sweethearts.\r\nNancy: It's true! We barely escaped with our lives! It was horrible!\r\nPerch Perkins: And what was the name of your friends?\r\nNancy: Pearl, and her boyfriend SpongeBob!\r\nPerch Perkins: So there you have it. As time quickly runs out  still no word from the imperiled whale girl and SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: Oh, no! I'm out of coral on a stick!  Time to chomp through the fried barnacles!\r\nPerch Perkins: At this time survival looks bleek, for the little yellow sponge.\r\nPatrick: This is my worst nightmare! I don't have a drink!\r\nPerch Perkins: Hey, doofus!\r\nPatrick: Huh?\r\nPerch Perkins: Your best buddy is trapped in the tunnel of glove and he may never escape!\r\nPatrick: You mean SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: I'm coming, SpongeBob!\r\nPoliceman: Hold it! No one beyond this point!\r\nPatrick: My best buddy is trapped in there! You gotta let me through!\r\nPoliceman: No can do, big guy! Too dangerous!\r\nPatrick: Fine!  Well, mister police guy won't let me in the front, huh! Well, I'll just find my own way in!\r\nPatrick: Let's see. Where could SpongeBob be?  Aha!  Con-grat-ulations! You have-uh-ooh-fouuunnd-uh your friend!  Oh, SpongeBob is right behind this door! I'm coming to get you, buddy!  SpongeBob?! Where-? Oh, there you are!  Hang in there! I'll free you from your shackles!  You're okay now, buddy! Go to your happy place! .\r\nPolice Officer: Don't worry, little girl! We're working as fast as we can!\r\nPearl: That wasn't me, that was SpongeBob!\r\nPoliceman: Thank you, little boy!\r\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Pearl, it's only the dark. There's nothin' scary about... the dark! It's what's in the dark you gotta watch out for . Monsters, creeps, ghouls, CLOWNS, witches, werewolves, CLOWNS, crawly things, CRAWLY CLOWNS, those are the worst CRAWLY CLOWNS.\r\nPearl: Well, whatever, SpongeBob, I'm gonna find my way out!\r\nSpongeBob: Pearl! I wouldn't do that! You're not keeping your arms and legs inside the boat! Pearl! Wait! I should probably accompany you, ya know, in case there's anything in the darkness.\r\nPearl: Fine. After you.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, then. I'll just fearlessly lead the way... Snakes!\r\nPearl: Those are streamers, fool!\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe I'll just stay up here... keep an eye out for any other creepies.\r\nPearl: Oh, grow up, SpongeBob!  There aren't any creepies, there aren't any crawlies, there aren't any snakes! So stop whining so we can look for a way out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Pearl, you've made your point. I'll stop talking about ogres, and vampire bat fish, and sharks, and...\r\nPearl: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: ...And I won't talk about ZOMBIES!\r\nPearl: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Or ghostly pirates!  Or laboratory creatures!\r\nPearl: SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Or green beings from another planet!\r\nPearl: Okay, SpongeBob. Okay.\r\nSpongeBob: Or bus drivers!\r\nPearl: Ah, that's enough!\r\nSpongeBob: Shhh. Did you hear that?\r\nPearl: Now I'm scared, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: It sounded like a crawly were-clown.\r\nPearl: But there's no such thing!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, he's here.\r\nSpongeBob: A ha ha ha, he.\r\nPatrick: Not another skunk! How did you beat me again?  Hey. You find it funny to lock up my best friend? Hey, I am talking towards you.\r\nElectrician: Did you see the dimwit who ripped this apart?\r\nPatrick: I unfortunately don't know who that dullard is, but I know you kidnapped SpongeBob.\r\nElectrician: I don't know about your best friend. I'm just the electrician.\r\nPatrick: Wow! I see you are a magician. But that voodoo does not erase what you just have done.\r\nElectrician: You need to relax. Have a seat and cool off.\r\nPatrick: Geez. Some people are so pushy.\r\nElectrician: Just don't sit on THE LEVER!\r\nPatrick: Oops.\r\nElectrician: Now the whole ride is stuck on \"Dangerous Super Fast Mode\"!\r\nPatrick: You told me to sit on it.\r\nSpongeBob: What was that?\r\nPearl: I don't know. Hold me, SpongeBob\r\nBoth: Huh!\r\nSpongeBob: Aww. The Hall of Great Romance!\r\nPatrick: Okay, okay. I think I heard you. I will not sit on anything else. I'll just gingerly lean on this wall.\r\nElectrician: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow! How romantical.\r\nPearl: Pssssst. I imagined it bigger.\r\nSpongeBob: Look! Pearl, a sweet adorable cherub.  Pearl. I don't think this is the Tunnel of Glove. It's the Tunnel of Evil!\r\nElectrician: Stupid kid.\r\nPatrick: Nice facilities. Great water pressure.\r\nElectrician: Neptune's mother!\r\nSpongeBob: What's that?\r\nEvil Fish #2, 3 and 4: Uhhhhhh!\r\nPolice Man: She's gonna blow! Noooooo!\r\nPearl: I guess that turned out to be pretty fun.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\r\nNancy: SpongeBob is your boyfriend.\r\nPearl: How many times to I have to say it? Eww! Gross!\r\nNancy: Oh, don't deny it. You were totally hugging him, and everyone knows that totally means he's totally your boyfriend.\r\nCrawly Clown: Howdy, kids!\r\nSpongeBob: Crawly clown!

This wiener tastes just like a Krabby Patty! Maybe we could add them to the menu?\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm not impressed...\r\nSpongeBob: I made it with leftover ingredients.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now I'm impressed!\r\nFrank: Hmm...I could've sworn that sign said \"Open.\"\r\nSquidward: Sigh...Once in awhile, I need to breathe in and not smell grease. Or the stench of my miserably failed life...Talking to myself...again...\r\nSpongeBob: And then I just cook it like this!\r\nMr. Krabs: Go on.\r\nFrank: My! What an interesting shape! Are those for sale?\r\nMr. Krabs: Why? Would you like to buy one?\r\nFrank: Well, that would depend on the price.\r\nMr. Krabs: Would you pay the same as what a Krabby Patty costs?\r\nFrank: Hmm...sure! I suppose so!\r\nMr. Krabs: What 'bout double?\r\nFrank: Now you're talking!\r\nCustomer: Krabby Patties again? Sigh… if only there were something else...

And what are these paramedics doing here?\r\nMr. Krabs: You're back in yer old kitchen. And the paramedics were here to revive ye.\r\nSpongeBob: I was asleep?\r\nKr.

But now we have this!\r\nSpongeBob: And what about my… my spatula?\r\nMr. Krabs: I got'cha a new one!\r\nMr. Krabs: Alright! Those wieners aren't going to rotisserie themselves. Everybody back to work.\r\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, captain.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, can I talk to you for 1 second?\r\nSquidward: I don't know. That's a pretty long talk.\r\nSpongeBob: Has anything ever happened at your job that… well, made it not-as-fun as it used to be?\r\nSquidward: Actually, yes.\r\nSpongeBob: Really?! What was it?\r\nSquidward: Being hired.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't know why, but things aren't just the same after Krusty Dogs were added to the menu.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, my boy, I realized long ago that there is nothing, I repeat, nothing, that could make this job any more boring, or humiliating, or demeaning, that it already is.\r\nBilly: Look at that guy dressed as a hot dog, Mommy.\r\nMom: Let that inspire you to stay in school, Billy.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy SpongeBob! How's go the wieners?\r\nSpongeBob: Eh, I was kinda wondering… could we just go back to selling Krabby Patties?\r\nMr. Krabs: What on earth for?! Krusty Dogs was your best idea ever boy!\r\nSpongeBob: I know. Well, I guess I sorta miss the Krabby Patties. After all, they're what gave this place its name.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yea, good point.\r\nSpongeBob: Yea! Don't' you think we should…  Krusty Dog?! Those wieners have got to go!\r\nSpongeBob: Here you go, hungry customers, your delicious Krusty Dogs!\r\nAbigail-Marge: They do look delicious!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes!  Eat one and you'll develop an unsightly skin condition.\r\nSpongeBob: Here's your footlong, sir!\r\nJimmy: Thanks! 12 inches of deliciousness!\r\nSpongeBob: Yea! You know what gives them that added flavor?\r\nJimmy: No, what?\r\nSpongeBob: Nose hairs and recycled dental floss.\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing?\r\nSpongeBob: We have got to get rid of these wieners and bring back the Krabby Patty!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I never thought I'd be saying this, but, count me in!\r\nSpongeBob: Hurray!\r\nSquidward: Help! I'm having terrible abdominal pain! I think it was the… the…  Line.\r\nSpongeBob: Wiener.\r\nSquidward: The wiener!\r\nSpongeBob: Ladies and gentlemen! Allow me to introduce myself.

I came here for 1 purpose today.\r\nMable: So I said, it didn't smell so bad, but it tastes...\r\nSpongeBob: Quiet, Granny, I'm talking!\r\nMable: Oh.\r\nSpongeBob: And that is to loudly decry these modern, new fangled days of wieners, and to band for a return to a simpler time. A Krabby Pattier time!\r\nSadie: I'm not really conceded about possible ill-health effects. How about you guys?\r\nClay: Eh.\r\nDennis: How about nostalgia?\r\nSadie: Never heard of it.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, that didn't work at all.\r\nSquidward: It only seemed to increase their appetite for wieners.\r\nSpongeBob: We need stronger tactics.\r\nSquidward: Right, something that would make Mr. Krabs' whole wiener thing blow right up in his face!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, blow up.  Squidward, that's it!\r\nSpongeBob: Beautiful.\r\nSpongeBob: Your Krusty Dog sir, with extra mustard.\r\nNat: Thanks.\r\nSpongeBob: Can I bring you something else?  Okay, I guess not.

And keep them Krabby Patties coming, boy!\r\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, captain!\r\nSquidward: .\r\nBilly: Look, Mommy!

As in the shipwreck Mauna Loa? Legend has it that the largest unfound pirate booty lies in a truance. I have been searching for this treasure during me entire adult life. Lookin' over every nook, every cranny, every denture. Once I get me claws on it, I'll be the richest crustacean in the world!\r\nSquidward: Well, I guess that explains this.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hmm, looks like him and Patrick are trying to haul the loot for themselves. Come on, Squidward. We got to let those two dingalings lead us straight to the Mauna Loa!\r\nSquidward: Actually, I have a hot date with my toenail clippers tonight, but have fun with that.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, do you think we gave away too much about our secret hideout?\r\nPatrick: Oh, jeez, SpongeBob, who cares if everyone knows about our secret hideout?\r\nSpongeBob: Doesn't that make the secret hideout a little less secrety?\r\nPatrick: No. It's just a secret that everybody knows about.  What's wrong, SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Just as I thought. We're being followed. That's it!  Heh, looks like no one was following us to the secret hideout after all!\r\nMr. Krabs: Found it!\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, were you following us?\r\nMr. Krabs: No. I just saw the sign.\r\nMr. Krabs: So you thought you could hide the treasure from old Mr. Krabs, did ya?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm not aware of any treasure. But I suppose since you're such a nice boss, you can hang out at the hideout. Just as long as you keep it a secret.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, nobody's treasure. You're such a nice boss. You expect me to believe this malarkey?!  You're a stonewall, eh? We'll see about that!

Well, it's just full of tickets!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, you usually find tickets in a ticket booth.\r\nMr. Krabs: Ticket booth?!\r\nSpongeBob: And why are there height restrictions on the cruit?\r\nMr. Krabs: \"Must Be This Tall To Ride?\"\r\nPatrick: Well, maybe they had something against short people.

Throw in Krabs, the old ringer, eh? You must have a treasure map or something. Where you keeping it? In your pocket?  Plastic? Hang on a minute. A plastic captain... a ticket booth... tokens?

Keep your worthless hunk of junk!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, but, would you mind keeping this worthless hunk of junk a secret? Wouldn't be much of a secret if we had a million people showing up!\r\nMr. Krabs: Oh-ho-ho, don't flatten yourself. People want to see the real thing!

But, luckily, they're not the worst kind of neighbor.\r\nSquidward: Well, that's nice.\r\nHoward: That would be the bubble blowers.

I can't let you do that!\r\nHoward: Well, of course you can. They're your neighbors, too.\r\nSquidward: No! You REALLY don't wanna go out there, trust me!\r\nHoward: You're hurting my arm!\r\nSquidward: Oh, sorry. I was just wondering if we could...\r\nHoward: Could, what?\r\nSquidward: Um, form a little duet together. Just you and me. Just the two of us. Together. You know.

He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic.  So, what do you think? You want to date him?\r\nSquilvia: Uh... I don't know. I'm not too sure...\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute! Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend, Squidward. Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know.\r\nSquilvia: Intelligent?\r\nSpongeBob: That's right! We are talking some serious credentials.\r\nSquilvia: L.A.M.E.? What school is that?\r\nSpongeBob: The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress.\r\nSquilvia: Really? Wow. He really said that?\r\nSpongeBob: You betcha! He's such a charmer.\r\nSquidward: Don't forget artistic and musical.\r\nSpongeBob: Not to mention that he's an incredible painter, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too.\r\nSquilvia: Oh, he sounds interesting!\r\nSpongeBob: But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward?  It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level. So, how does dinner at 8:00 sound, Squilvia?\r\nSquilvia: I think that sounds perfect. I'll come by your place, okay?\r\nSquidward: Uh-huh.\r\nSquilvia: See you at 8:00, Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: You okay, buddy.

Did you drop your lip balm!\r\nSpongeBob: I don't think I've dropped anything... Ooh! You shouldn't have.\r\nSquidward: Oh, but I wanted to!\r\nSpongeBob: No, you really shouldn't have. It's just that I'm very... I'm very aller...  ...very allergic to tulips. Anyway, are you ready to go?\r\nSquidward: Go where?\r\nSpongeBob: To dinner, silly.\r\nSquidward: Oh, right!

Can you believe this weather we're having?\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, good effort, but you might want to start with something more personal. A woman may like to talk about her day, for example. She may want to talk about her promotion at work, or the wacky antics of her pet snail, or talk about how I was nearly late for our date because I couldn't decide what to wear, and then I didn't really have enough cash to give the lady at the nail salon.\r\nSquidward: Urrgh!\r\nPatrick: Dinner is served.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh!

Which, by the way begins in five minutes.\r\nSpongeBob: Squidward, wait! We haven't covered...  We haven't covered all the tenants of Dating 101 yet!  As I was saying...

Perch Perkins here, coming to you live from in front of The Krusty Krab restaurant, for years the only place to get a delicious and mouthwatering Krabby Patty. Until today, that is. That's right, folks. Longtime owner Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant called The Krusty Krab 2. First of all, congratulations, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Hello. I like money.\r\nPerch Perkins: What inspired you to build a second Krusty Krab right next door to the original?\r\nMr. Krabs: Money.\r\nPlankton: Curses! It's not fair. Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer!\r\nKaren: Don't get worked up again, Plankton, I just mopped the floors.\r\nPlankton: Oh, Karen, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty. Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. Lord knows I've tried. I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet...from A to Y.\r\nKaren: A to Y?\r\nPlankton: Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet.\r\nKaren: What about Z?\r\nPlankton: Z?\r\nKaren: Z. The letter after Y.\r\nPlankton: W, X, Y, Z.  Plan Z! Here it is, just like you said.\r\nKaren: Oh, boy.\r\nPlankton: Oh! Oh! Ohhh! It's evil. It's diabolical.  It's lemon-scented. This Plan Z can't possibly fail!  So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula. Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world! All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...!  Ow!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm ready, promotion... I'm ready, promotion...\r\nPlankton: Ow! Ow! Ow!

You didn't get the job!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nMr. Krabs: You... did not... get... the job.\r\nSpongeBob: But... But why?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... mature than you.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm not... mature?\r\nMr. Krabs: Lad, I mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is... now, let's see...\r\nLenny: Dork?\r\nMr. Krabs: No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.\r\nPearl: A goofball?\r\nMr. Krabs: Closer, but no, no, no.\r\nFred: A ding-a-ling.\r\nJimmy: Wing nut.\r\nMable: A Knucklehead McSpazatron!\r\nMr. Krabs: OK, that's enough! Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're just a kid. And to be a manager, you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it \"kid-ager.\" You understand-ager? I mean, you understand?\r\nSpongeBob: I guess so, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob : I'm ready. Depression. I'm ready.

The royal court is now in session. Bring the prisoner forward.\r\nNeptune: So, you have confessed to the crime of touching the king's crown?\r\nPrisoner: Yes, but...\r\nNeptune: But what?!\r\nPrisoner: But it's my job, Your Highness. I'm the royal crown polisher.\r\nNeptune: Well, then I guess I can't execute you. Twenty years in the dungeon it is.\r\nMindy: Daddy!  You're free to go.\r\nCrown Polisher: Bless you, Princess Mindy.\r\nNeptune: Mindy, how dare you defy me?!\r\nMindy: Why do you have to be so mean?\r\nNeptune: I am the king. I must enforce the laws of the sea.\r\nMindy: Father, I wish you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments.\r\nSquire: That would be nice.\r\nNeptune: Squire, clear the room. I wish to speak to my daughter alone.  What is this, Mindy?\r\nMindy: Your crown?\r\nNeptune: And what does this crown do?\r\nMindy: It covers your bald spot.\r\nNeptune: It's not bald! It's... thinning. This crown does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline.  No, this crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. One day, you will wear this crown.\r\nMindy: I'm gonna be bald?!\r\nNeptune: Thinning! Anyway, the point is, you won't wear it until you learn how to rule with an iron fist. Like your father.\r\nMindy: Dad, your \"crown\"...\r\nNeptune: What the...?  My crown! Aah! Someone has stolen the royal crown!\r\nPlankton: I got it.

Wow, the pressure's already setting in.\r\nSpongeBob: No, Pat, you don't understand. I didn't get the promotion.\r\nPatrick: What? Why?\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.\r\nPatrick: What?! That's insane!\r\nSpongeBob: I know.\r\nPatrick: Well, saying you're a kid, it's like saying I'm a kid!\r\nWaiter: Here's your Goober Meal, sir.\r\nPatrick: I'm supposed to get a toy with this.

Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Now, pay attention, Squidward. As new manager, you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers.\r\nSquidward: Yawn.\r\nMr. Krabs: What's this? King Neptune is riding toward the Krusty Krab at lunchtime! He's got money!\r\nNeptune: Stay in the coach, daughter.  This won't take long.\r\nMindy: Daddy, please. I think you're overreacting.\r\nNeptune: Silence, Mindy. I know what I'm doing.  Ow! Squire!\r\nSquire: Yes, Your Highness?\r\nNeptune: Have this pole executed at once.\r\nSquidward: A hundred and one dollars for a Krabby Patty?\r\nMr. Krabs: With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese.\r\nNeptune: Greeting, subjects. I seek the one known as Eugene Krabs. May he present himself to me at once.\r\nMr. Krabs: I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness. Would you like to order something?\r\nNeptune: Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs! You have stolen the royal crown, you cannot deny. For, clever as you are, you left one damning piece of evidence at the scene of the crime.\r\nMr. Krabs: \"I stole your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs?!\"\r\nNeptune: Relinquish the royal crown to me at once!\r\nMr. Krabs: But... But this is crazy! I didn't do it!\r\nThe Phone: Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs. Leave a message.\r\nClay: Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay, the guy you sold Neptune's crown to. Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown. I sold it to a guy in Shell City, and I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown.  Which is now in Shell City. Goodbye.\r\nMr. Krabs: Heh, heh... Don't you just hate wrong numbers?\r\nNeptune: My crown is in the forbidden Shell City?!\r\nPlankton: Plan Z. I love Plan Z.\r\nKing Neptune: Prepare to burn, Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait, Neptune! Please, I'm begging you! I ain't a crook! Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me!\r\nKing Neptune: Very well, then. Before I turn this conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anything to say about Eugene Krabs?\r\nSpongeBob: I've got something to say about Mr.  Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, you've come just in time. Please, tell King Neptune all about me.\r\nSpongeBob: I have worked for Mr. Krabs for many years and always thought he was a great boss.\r\nMr. Krabs: You see? A great boss.\r\nSpongeBob: I now realize that he's a GREAT BIG JERK! I deserve that manager's job! But you didn't give it to me, because you say I'm a kid. Well, I am 100% man! And this man has got something to say to you.  There, I think I made my point.\r\nKing Neptune: Anyone else? No? Well, then.\r\nSpongeBob: Huh?\r\nMr. Krabs: Ooh! Me pants are on fire! Me underwear's on fire! I'm on fire!  Oh, yeah.\r\nKing Neptune: And now, Eugene Krabs,  you... will...\r\nSpongeBob: Wait! I'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.\r\nKing Neptune: Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City. That's why he must die.\r\nSpongeBob: Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?\r\nKing Neptune: You don't understand. My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority. And between you and me... my hair is thinning a bit.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that noticeable... Bald! Bald!}}\r\nFred: My eyes!\r\nKing Neptune: All right, all right.\r\nSpongeBob: King Neptune, sir? Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get your crown back?\r\nKing Neptune: You, go to Shell City?  No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned. What makes you think you could? You're just a kid.\r\nSpongeBob: But I'm not a kid. I can do it.\r\nKing Neptune: Run along. I have a crab to cook.\r\nSpongeBob: No! I won't let you.\r\nKing Neptune: Very well, then. I'll have to fry you both!\r\nMindy: Daddy, stop it! Can't you get through one day without executing someone?\r\nKing Neptune: Mindy, I told you to stay in the carriage.\r\nMindy: Where's your love and compassion?  Look at this little guy. He's willing to risk his life to find your crown and save his boss.\r\nKing Neptune: But, daughter, I...\r\nMindy: Please, Father? At least let him try. What have you got to lose? Might I remind you of your special problem?\r\nAll: Bald! Bald! Bald!\r\nFred: My eyes!\r\nKing Neptune: All right. Very well, Mindy. I'll give him a chance. But when your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter this crab all over the walls.\r\nMr. Krabs: Huh?\r\nKing Neptune: And as for you, be back here with my crown in exactly 10 days!\r\nPatrick: He can do it in 9!\r\nKing Neptune: 8!\r\nPatrick: 7!\r\nKing Neptune: 6!\r\nSpongeBob & Mr. Krabs: Patrick!\r\nKing Neptune: Six it is, then.\r\nPatrick: Fi--ve.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, shush!\r\nKing Neptune: Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands!\r\nMr. Krabs: No, wait! I'm begging you!\r\nSquidward: Who turned on the AC?  Mr. Krabs! Oh, no, this is terrible! Who's gonna sign my paycheck?\r\nKing Neptune: Come along, Mindy.\r\nMindy: Listen, you guys, the road to Shell City is really dangerous. There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere. And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops  who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures. Don't let him catch you, because if he does, he'll take you back to his lair, and you'll never be seen again.\r\nPatrick: She's pretty, SpongeBob.\r\nMindy: Here, take this.\r\nSpongeBob: What's in here?\r\nMindy: It's a magical bag of winds. I stole them from my father.\r\nPatrick: You're hot.\r\nMindy: Once you find the crown, open the bag of winds and you'll be blown back home.\r\nNeptune: Mindy!\r\nMindy: I'm coming. Good luck, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Wait. How did you know my name?\r\nMindy: Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. I've learned the names of all the sea creatures.\r\nPatrick: What's my name?\r\nMindy: That's easy. You're Patrick Star.\r\nNeptune: Mindy!\r\nMindy: I gotta go. I believe in you guys.\r\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Mindy.  Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward and I...\r\nSquidward: Pass.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick and I...\r\nPatrick: Hi.\r\nSpongeBob: ... are gonna get that crown back and save you from Neptune's wrath. You've got nothing to worry about. Your life is in our hands.  Patrick, let's go get that crown!\r\nSpongeBob: Feast your eyes, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: What is it?\r\nSpongeBob: The Patty Wagon.

I'm sorry. He confided in me a secret wish. \"Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket,\" he said. \"Don't let the flame die out.\"  By the way, act now and you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase.

Nothing can stop me now!\r\nKaren: Nothing except SpongeBob and his pink friend.  My sensors indicate that they're going after the crown. If they make it back, Neptune might discover some fingerprints. Tiny fingerprints. Stubby, tiny fingerprints.\r\nPlankton: Evil Plan Z is way ahead of you, baby. I've already hired someone to take care of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator!\r\nDennis: Sesame seed.\r\nFloyd: Hey, mister, does that hat take ten gallons?\r\nPatrick: Going on.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah! Moving on.

With?\r\nSquidward: So you're selling Krabby Patties, eh, Plankton?\r\nPlankton: That's right, Squidward.  And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. Care for one?\r\nSquidward: No. You may have hoodwinked everyone else in this backwater town, but you can't fool me. I listen to public radio.\r\nPlankton: And what's that supposed to mean?\r\nSquidward: It means you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.  It was you all along. But you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land, King Neptune!\r\nPlankton: We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips.\r\nKaren: Now activating helmet brain-control devices.\r\nSquidward: Huh? What?\r\nWearers of Helmets: All hail Plankton.\r\nSquidward: What's going on here?\r\nPlankton's Slaves : All hail Plankton.\r\nPlankton: Seize him, slaves!\r\nSlaves: All hail Plankton.\r\nSquidward: I'm getting outta here!\r\nSlaves: All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.\r\nPlankton: Who can stop me now?! Who?!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Pat, one more time.\r\nPatrick: Okay.  We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out.\r\nSpongeBob: Weed 'em out!\r\nPatrick: What a jerk.\r\nSpongeBob: Whoa! The road's getting kinda bumpy here.\r\nPatrick: You know, SpongeBob, there's a lesson to be learned from all of this.\r\nSpongeBob: What's that, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: A bubble-blowing double baby doesn't belong out here in man's country.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah.  Wait. We blew that bubble. Doesn't that make us a bubble-blowing double baby?\r\nPatrick: Hey look! Free ice cream!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy!\r\nPatrick: How you doing? Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\r\nPatrick: Make mine a chocolate!\r\nSpongeBob: Got you covered.  Two, please.\r\nOld Woman: Certainly. You kids enjoy.\r\nSpongeBob: Actually, we're men, lady, but thanks.  Hey, Patrick, let's...  You can let go now. I said, let go, please.  What is this? What kind of old lady are you?  Eww.\r\nPatrick: Did you get the ice cream?\r\nSpongeBob: Step on it, Patrick!\r\nDennis: Hmm...\r\nVictor: Hey!  You may not know it, cowboy, but we got a rule around here about blowing bubbles.\r\nAll Thugs: All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every...able-bodied...patron...\r\nOld Woman: Come on, kiddies, have some ice cream.  I'll let you pet Mr. Whiskers.\r\nMr. Whiskers: Meow.\r\nSpongeBob: Jump for it, Patrick!  Well, we lost our car again.\r\nPatrick: Never mind the car, where's the road?  Road, road, road,  road, road, road, road,  r... Sorry.\r\nSpongeBob: There's the road.  On the other side of this  deep, dark... dangerous...\r\nPatrick: Hazardous.\r\nSpongeBob: Hazardous...\r\nPatrick: Monster-infested.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, monster-infested...  trench.\r\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look!  Here's the way down. Well, we're not gonna get the crown standing here. On to Shell City.  Hey, look, it's making noise. SpongeBob?  Hey, where are you going?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm going home, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: But what about Mr. Krabs?\r\nSpongeBob: What about us? We'll never survive in that trench. You said it yourself, this is man's country. And let's face it, Pat. We're just...kids.\r\nPatrick: We're not kids!\r\nSpongeBob: Open your eyes, Patrick! We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream. We worship a dancing peanut, for corn's sake! We don't belong out here!\r\nPatrick: We do not worship him!\r\nSpongeBob: You've been wearing the same Goofy Goober Peanut Party underpants for three years straight!  What do you call that!?\r\nPatrick: Worship?  You're right, SpongeBob. We are kids!\r\nSpongeBob: Pull your pants up, Patrick. We're going home.\r\nMindy: But you can't go home!\r\nSpongebob: Mindy!\r\nPatrick: Mindy?!\r\nSpongeBob: How much did you hear?\r\nMindy: I heard enough.\r\nPatrick: Did you see my underwear?\r\nMindy: No, Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Did you want to?\r\nMindy: Look, guys, you may be kids, but you're the only ones left who can get that crown.\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean, the only ones left?\r\nMindy: Things have gotten a lot worse since you left Bikini Bottom.  Or should I say, Planktopolis.\r\nSlaves: All hail Plankton.\r\nPlankton: No resting! This monument celebrating my glory isn't gonna build itself. Move faster!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look! Plankton's turned everyone we know into slaves.  Squidward, Sandy, Mrs. Puff,  even Gary.\r\nGary: Meow Plankton.\r\nSpongeBob: Can't your father do something?\r\nMindy: My father's too distracted by his bald spot to do anything.\r\nNeptune: Squire, will you hurry?\r\nMindy: So you see, you can't quit. The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands.\r\nSpongeBob: But... But we're just...\r\nMindy: Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids. What's so wrong with being a kid, anyway? Kids rule! You don't need to be a man to do this. You just gotta believe in yourself. You just gotta believe!\r\nSpongeBob: I believe.\r\nMindy: That's the spirit!\r\nSpongeBob: I believe that...everybody I know is a goner!\r\nMindy: Come on, guys.  Guys...  Guys?  Ew!\r\nNarrator: Meanwhile.\r\nMindy: Guys?  Oh, boy. Think, Mindy, think.  Yup, I guess you're right.  A couple of kids could never survive this journey.  That's why I guess I'll just have to turn you into men.\r\nSpongeBob: You can do that? How?\r\nMindy: With my mermaid magic\r\nSpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? She'll use her mermaid magic to turn us into men!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!  We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men!\r\nMindy: Good. Now, let's get started. Close your eyes.\r\nSpongeBob: Are we men yet?\r\nMindy: Not yet. Uhhh... spin around three times.\r\nSpongeBob: I think it's working.\r\nMindy: Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.  With my mermaid magic and my one tailfin , I command the two of you to turn into men! Open your eyes.\r\nSpongeBob: I don't feel any...  Oh, my gosh, Patrick, you have a mustache!\r\nPatrick: So do you!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow.\r\nMindy: So now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?  Guys!\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah?\r\nMindy: I said, now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Heck, yeah!\r\nMindy: Are men afraid of anything?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Heck, no!\r\nMindy: And why?\r\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Because we're invincible!  Yeah!\r\nMindy: I never said that!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, buddy?\r\nSpongeBob: Why did we jump over the edge instead of taking the stairs?\r\nPatrick: Bec... well...\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick.\r\nPatrick: Huh.

What, you think this is a game of kickball on the playground? You never had a chance to defeat me, fool! And you know why?\r\nSpongeBob: Because you cheated?\r\nPlankton: No, not because I cheated! Because I'm an evil genius. And you're just a kid. A stupid kid!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess you're right, Plankton. I am just a kid.\r\nPlankton: Of course I'm right. Okay, Neptune, time to kill.\r\nSpongeBob: And you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, twenty-seven-and-a-half seconds. And if I've learned anything during that time, It's that you are who you are.\r\nPlankton: That's right. Okay, Neptune...\r\nSpongeBob: And no amount of mermaid magic...  ...or managerial promotion...  ...or some other third thing... can make me anything more than what I really am inside: A kid.\r\nPlankton: That's great. Now, get back against the wall.\r\nSpongeBob: But that's okay.\r\nPlankton: What? What's going on?\r\nSpongeBob: Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do. I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back.\r\nPlankton: All right, we get the point.\r\nSpongeBob: So, yeah, I'm a kid.  And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut. And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!\r\nPlankton: What's going on here?\r\nSpongeBob: But most of all, I'm...\r\nPlankton: Okay, settle down.

But today...  ...things would be different.\r\nPatrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Morning, Patrick! Are you here for your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?\r\nPatrick: I'm getting two today. One for me, and one for my friend.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, have I met this friend?\r\nPatrick: You know me, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.\r\nMr. Krabs: 13, 14, 15...\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.\r\nMr. Krabs: Tartar...  ...sauce?\r\nPlankton: Bullseye!\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton!\r\nMr. Krabs: So it's a food fight he wants, eh?\r\nPlankton: Welcome to Air Plankton! Please put your seat backs and tray tables up as we're now approaching our final destination.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. Load the potatoes!\r\nPatrick: Mashed or scalloped, sir?\r\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. Raw.\r\nPatrick: Sir, yes, sir!  Locked and loading!\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't worry, little formula. You'll be safe in this...safe.  Fire!\r\nPlankton: Potatoes?!\r\nSpongeBob: He's closing in!\r\nPatrick: I think we have a few minutes before he gets here.  Huh?  He's right on top of us!\r\nSandals: Hey, it's raining fries!\r\nPlankton: It's gonna take a lot more than potatoes to bring this baby down!  Or maybe not.\r\nPatrick: Whoo!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick. Look! He's got a tank!\r\nPlankton: Well, Krabs, you're certainly in a pickle now!\r\nSandals: Hey, it's raining pickles!  Now, it's raining...  ...tanks.\r\nPlankton: You're welcome.\r\nPatrick: Finland.\r\nSpongeBob: Your order, sir.\r\nSandy: I'll have two Krabby Patties: extra ketchup, extra mustard, and hold the mayo.\r\nSpongeBob: Wrong channel!  Your order, sir!\r\nMr. Krabs: Extra ketchup, extra mustard, hold the mayo!\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir!  Extra ketchup, extra mustard.\r\nPatrick: Hold the mayo!\r\nMr. Krabs: Unleash the condiments.\r\nSpongeBob: With relish.  Excuse me!\r\nSandy: Hello? Hello?!  Guess ya'll don't want my money.\r\nMr. Krabs: Money?!  Thank you. Come again.\r\nPatrick: I can't hold the mayo any longer!\r\nPlankton: Mayo?! Well, it's gonna take a lot more than mayo to stop-\r\nSpongeBob: Now what?\r\nPatrick: Uhh... I just remembered! I don't work for Mr. Krabs.\r\nSpongeBob: Robot! Robot! Robot! Giant robot! Robot! Robot!  Mr. Krabs! Plankton's here, and he's got a giant robot!\r\nMr. Krabs: Quick, boy! Bar the door!\r\nSpongeBob: Got it!\r\nPlankton: I'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Oh, barnacles! I'm out of gas?!  Well, I'm not through yet. I've got something that will make you hand over that formula: something you can't resist.\r\nMr. Krabs: Money?!\r\nPlankton: Yes.  That's...that's...that's impossible!  Well, it was full of money just last week. Then I bought that airplane, and built that tank-\r\nMr. Krabs: Sounds to me like someone's just a wee bit...broke!\r\nPlankton: Well, Krabs, I guess you've won. I've spent every penny I've ever made trying to put you out of business...  ...except this one: my last penny.  Besides, what could I do with one measly cent, anyway?\r\nMr. Krabs: You could give it to me.  Just a suggestion.\r\nPlankton: Here.  Take it!  You've taken everything else. Why not?!\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, Plankton, like a reheated Krabby Patty, you've been foiled again!\r\nSpongeBob: I guess this means that the secret formula is safe forever. Right, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: It sure does, boy.  Why don't you scurry along?  Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!  He's been out there crying for twenty minutes.  Pathetic.  I'm just gonna go out there and gloat a little.\r\nPlankton: Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.\r\nKaren: Laptop.  You do realize that nickname is demeaning. I have twice the processing power of  a laptop.\r\nPlankton: Never mind. Maintain radio silence.  He-he, finally!  A pressure plate, eh, Krabs? Amateur hour.  Hmm...  Perfect.  Not a bad likeness.  Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs. Easy, easy.\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton's broke! Ooh-ooh! Plankton's broke! Ha-ha!\r\nSpongeBob: Look at Mr. Krabs go! I've never seen him gloat this hard before.\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, Plankton, me bunions are telling me it's time to stop gloatin'.  Eh? Looks like you're falling apart at the seams.  Huh?\r\nPlankton Robot: Poor me.  Sob, sob.\r\nMr. Krabs: A robot?!\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton?!\r\nPlankton: Uh-oh.  That ain't good.\r\nComputer Voice: Initiating Lockdown Sequence.\r\nMr. Krabs: Me formuler!\r\nSquidward: Huh?  Ow!\r\nMr. Krabs: No, no, no! No, no, no!  No!  Squidward! Open up! Squidward!\r\nPlankton Robot: Ha, ha! Victory dance! Booya!\r\nSpongeBob: Give me that!\r\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob!  Join me, and we'll be rich and powerful! ...  ...until I eventually betray you!  Uuh... Join me!\r\nSpongeBob: No! Never! I'm on team Krabs for life!\r\nMr. Krabs: Plankton!\r\nSpongeBob: What? Where'd it go?\r\nPlankton: Wait a minute... Molecular deconstruction? I proved that to be a scientific impossibility 7 times!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute... I think I forgot to empty Gary's litter box today.\r\nMr. Krabs: Where's me formuler, Plankton?!\r\nPlankton: I-I don't know! It just disappeared!\r\nMr. Krabs: Why should I believe you, ya lyin' liar?!\r\nSpongeBob: Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs, but this time, he's telling the truth! It just vanished!\r\nPlankton: It's true!\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you! He's innocent!\r\nPlankton: W-What are you gonna do, Krabs?! Pour hot oil on me?! Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?!\r\nMr. Krabs: No. Knock-Knock.\r\nPlankton: Knock-Knock jokes? I can do this all day, Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: Knock-Knock.\r\nPlankton: Oh, boy. Who's there?\r\nMr. Krabs: Jimmy.\r\nPlankton: Jimmy who?\r\nMr. Krabs: Jimmy back me formuler, Plankton!\r\nPlankton: Well, that's stupid, but how is it torture?\r\nMr. Krabs: Hehehehe... You'll see.\r\nSpongeBob: Jimmy... Back my formula? Hmm. Ohhhhhhhhh! I get it!\r\nPlankton: Oh, make it stop, Krabs! Make it stop!\r\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs!  SpongeBob, zip it!\r\nPlankton: Oh, thank you, Squidward!\r\nSquidward: The customers are getting restless. They're asking for...  refunds.\r\nMr. Krabs: Refunds?!  Listen up boy!  Get in there and make me customers some Krabby Patties! All right, Plankton...  SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?  We're out of Krabby Patties?!\r\nSpongeBob: How can we make more Krabby Patties without the secret formula?!\r\nMr. Krabs: You've got to have that formuler memorized by now!\r\nSpongeBob: But as you are aware sir,  the employee handbook clearly states and I quote,  \"No employee may, in part or in whole, commit the Krabby Patty Secret Formula to any recorded, written, or visual form, including memories, dreams, and/or needle point.\"\r\nMr. Krabs: Curse you, fine print!\r\nMr. Krabs: Stop!  I'm not your enemy!  Plankton is your enemy!\r\nSquidward: So is he an anemone or Plankton?\r\nMrs. Puff: Well, someone had to do it.\r\nSpongeBob: But...but, Mr. Krabs?\r\nMr. Krabs: He took this from you.\r\nFred: A Krabby Patty.\r\nSandals: I can almost taste it.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take the secret formula.\r\nMr. Krabs: Not now, SpongeBob!\r\nPatrick: Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty.\r\nMr. Krabs: So, join me. Help get the formuler back, and I'll give each and every one of ya a free Krabby Patty!  Oh, no, wait! Even better: a slight discount.  To the Chum Bucket!\r\nSpongeBob: But he didn't do it.\r\nPlankton: I had it right in my greedy little mits, and then: poof! And now it's gone. Gone forever! Oh, I was so close to gaining the people's respect/fear.\r\nKaren: Um, Plankton?\r\nPlankton: Oh, when will my frustration/humiliation end?\r\nKaren: Plankton...\r\nPlankton: Not now, Hun! I'm ranting/raving.  All right, what is it?\r\nKaren: Well, I was trying to tell you there's an angry mob outside,  but now they're inside.\r\nPlankton: Oh...\r\nKaren: I...just work here.\r\nMr. Krabs: We'd like to have a word with you.\r\nPlankton: You all look very hungry. Can I get anybody a Chumburger?\r\nMr. Krabs: Enough with that niceties, Plankton! This is the last time I'm gonna ask you. Where is me formuler?!\r\nPlankton: I told you, Krabs! I don't have it!\r\nMr. Krabs: Wrong answer!\r\nSpongeBob: Stop! All right, Mr. Krabs. Let me get in on this.\r\nPlankton: What's going on around here?\r\nSpongeBob: You may want to step back a little, Mr. Krabs. This could get messy.\r\nMr. Krabs: Let's hope so.\r\nSpongeBob: So, you won't talk, eh, Plankton?  I didn't wanna have to do this. Plankton,...  ...here comes the pain!\r\nMr. Krabs: Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical.\r\nPlankton: No, stop, don't!\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait, that didn't look painful.\r\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you may not understand what I'm about to do today.  But someday, we'll look back and have a good laugh.\r\nMr. Krabs: Wait a minute.\r\nCustomer: Hey, they're getting away!\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs!\r\nMr. Krabs: So, you've been runnin' a long con on me, eh? All these years, you've been working for Plankton?!\r\nPaco: They're in cahoots!\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, I guess that's a short way of saying it. Stop that bubble!\r\nCustomer: Please tell me there's something soft below me.\r\nSpongeBob and Plankton: Uh, nope.\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  Oh, you were like an underpaid son to me. I would have expected Squidward to stab me in the back!\r\nSquidward: Huh, what?\r\nMr. Krabs: But SpongeBob, me most trusted employee, working with me sworn enemy?!  You know what this means, Mr. Squidward?\r\nSquidward: We get the rest of the day off?\r\nMr. Krabs: No! This be but a harbinger of what I fear lies ahead. For you, for me, for all of Bikini Bottom! The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together! Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order! A war of all against all! Dark times are ahead! Dark times indeed!\r\nSquidward: Seriously?  Aren't you overreacting a bit?\r\nMr. Krabs: Welcome to the apocalypse, Mr. Squidward.  I hope you like leather.\r\nSquidward: I prefer suede.\r\nBurger Beard: And so, Bikini Bottom became an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore. The end!\r\nKyle: Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending!\r\nDavid: Oh, this is bad. Really bad! SpongeBob's in trouble, and the story's over?!\r\nAndy: Ouch, Ouch, Ouch!\r\nHenry: There is no way that that's the end of the story.\r\nBurger Beard: Oh, of course it is. I'll show you. Just turn around.\r\nHenry: Oh, all right.  Hey, I need that to fly, you jerk!\r\nBurger Beard: The end!\r\nHenry: That's not the end.\r\nAndy: You'd better keep reading, Mr. Pirate,...  ...or else!\r\nHenry: I know I shouldn't be littering, but that ending was rubbish!\r\nPatrick: Good morning, Squidward. I'll have the usual.  With cheese.\r\nSquidward: We're out of Krabby Patties right now!\r\nPatrick: No...Krabby Patties?!  No!\r\nSpongeBob: Look what's become of Bikini Bottom. We've really gotta get that formula back.\r\nPlankton: Hmm... Get the secret formula, you say? Excuse me, I...need a moment. With that formula, I could rule the world!\r\nSpongeBob: You know I can hear you, right?\r\nPlankton: Well, what do we do now?\r\nSpongeBob: Now we work together. You know, teamwork.\r\nPlankton: What's a te-amwork?\r\nSpongeBob: No, Plankton, teamwork.\r\nPlankton: Te-amwork.\r\nSpongeBob: Teamwork.\r\nPlankton: Tie 'em work.\r\nSpongeBob: Teamwork.\r\nPlankton: Tie 'em up.\r\nSpongeBob: Say \"team\" like a sports...\r\nPlankton: Team.\r\nSpongeBob: Team. Now say \"work.\"\r\nPlankton: Work.\r\nSpongeBob: Put 'em together, what do you got?\r\nPlankton: Time bomb... work.\r\nSpongeBob: Gettin' better.\r\nJohnny: Now, Bikini Bottom action news!\r\nSandy: Oh! Hey, Patrick!\r\nPatrick: Come on, tummy. It's gonna be a long day.\r\nJohnny: We interrupt your regular program for an important news bulletin!\r\nPerch Perkins: Perch Perkins reporting live from Downtown Bikini...  ...Bottom. Complete chaos here today as our town attempts to deal with a sudden and complete shortage of Krabby Patties.  Whoa! Events here have this reporter wondering, what is the secret ingredient in Krabby Patties, anyway?!\r\nFish: It's love! The secret ingredient is love!\r\nSandy: No more Krabby Patties?! If I'd known that, I'd have chewed it slower. Huh?  What the corndog is that?!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, Plankton, it's easy, It means I help you, you help me, and when we accomplish our goal, then we do hands in the middle.\r\nPlankton: Hands in the middle? No, no, sounds idiotic. Besides, the two of us are no match for that cranky mob.  We could probably use a few more... te-am-works.\r\nSpongeBob: That's exactly what I was thinking.\r\nPlankton: Wait, what are you doing?\r\nPatrick: I...need...Krabby Patties!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\r\nPatrick: I...need...Krabby Patties!  Vandalizing stuff.\r\nPlankton: Isn't that your house?\r\nPatrick: Hey, what's with all the questions?! Who are you guys?!\r\nSpongeBob: It's me, your best friend, SpongeBob.\r\nPatrick: Oh, yeah. Well, if you're SpongeBob, then what's the secret password?\r\nSpongeBob and Plankton: Uhh...\r\nPatrick: Correct! It is you! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob! Why aren't you at the Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.\r\nPatrick: Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.\r\nSpongeBob: No, that's not what happened. It just disappeared. We're putting a team together to find it.\r\nPatrick: A team? Oh, oh, pick me, pick me, pick me!\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, you're in.\r\nPlankton: I don't know, SpongeBob.  What exactly does this clown bring to the te-am?\r\nSpongeBob: He brings loyalty, Plankton, loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Yeah, yeah, loyalty. I've got SpongeBob! He's over here!\r\nMr. Krabs: Let's go get him!\r\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob. Let's get out of here!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick-  Patrick, why are you doing this?!\r\nPatrick: Because I need Krabby Patties! Hurry up! I'm hungry! Over here!  Guys? Am I still on the team?  Hey, what are you looking at?\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy!  Sandy?  Sandy. Sandy, are you home? Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is. What is all this stuff?  Sandy?\r\nSandy: Don't touch that!  Incoherent muttering...\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, are you okay?\r\nSandy: Okay?!  Have you looked outside?! Does that seem okay to you?! I'm trying to figure out what happened to society. If we don't fix it soon, there won't be anything left to fix!\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy! The lack of Krabby Patties has driven her mad.\r\nSandy: And I think I figured it out. Look!  When this came down from above, I knew it could only mean one thing.\r\nSpongeBob: And that would be?\r\nSandy: It means it's the end! The sandwich gods are angry with us!\r\nSpongeBob and Plankton: Sandwich gods?\r\nSandy: I just don't know how we're going to appease them!\r\nPlankton: You got any other friends who aren't dim bulbs or nut jobs?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, I have one friend who's loyal to the very end.  Gary, I'm home.  Gare bear?  Gary? Gary?  Huh?\r\nPlankton: Revolting!\r\nSpongeBob: But it means Gary is close by. Gary, I'm back! Whoa.  Oh, hey, Gary. Plankton and I need you to help us find the Krabby Patty formula and fix Bikini Bottom.\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean you don't have to do as I say anymore?!\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean king of snails?! Gary the Snail, you get down here right now and join this team!\r\nSpongeBob: What do you mean seize them?!\r\nPlankton: Why are you running?\r\nSpongeBob: Because they're right on our tail.  Oh, right, snails.\r\nPlankton: Well, so much for your te-am.\r\nSpongeBob: Putting together a team is a lot harder than I thought it would be.\r\nMr. Krabs: This way!\r\nPlankton: We better get out of here until things cool off.\r\nSpongeBob: Everything we know and love has been destroyed.\r\nPlankton: Well, yeah, looks like they're gonna have to change the name of Bikini Bottom to Dirty Bottom  right SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: That's kinda gross, Plankton.\r\nPlankton: Yeah, yeah, too soon, huh?\r\nSpongeBob: This feels like it really is the end.\r\nPlankton: Don't worry, SpongeBob. We'll find the secret formula and everything will go back to the way it was. You know, all happy and junk.  Now let's try and get some sleep.\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I guess you're right.\r\nPlankton: There you are, feel comfy?\r\nSpongeBob: You know, Plankton? I think you might know a little bit more about teamwork than you lead on.\r\nPlankton: Good night, SpongeBob.\r\nSpongeBob: Good night, Plankton.\r\nPlankton: Good night, indeed.  That's right SpongeBob, sleep. You're hiding that formula in there somewhere.  Huh?  Well, here goes nothing.  Huh? What... is this place?\r\nIce Cream Boy: Fudge fight!  It's all over me.\r\nPlankton: Ew! It's so sweet in here. I think my eyeball is getting a toothache.\r\nPopsicle Twins: Hello, Plankton. Come and play with us  Hurry.  Before we melt.\r\nGiant Fluffy Cat: Meow.\r\nPlankton: So much sweetness! I think I'm gonna be sick.  Huh?\r\nRainbow: Daddy!\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton? Oh, Plankton, I just had the craziest dream, and you were in it.\r\nPlankton: I'm sure it was nothing.  Now, go back to sleep.\r\nSpongeBob: Were you in my brain?\r\nPlankton: What? No! That's crazy talk!\r\nSpongeBob: Then why is there cotton candy on your antennae?\r\nPlankton: Because uh... because uh... okay, fine, I was in your brain.\r\nSpongeBob: What were you doing in there?\r\nPlankton: What do you think I was doing? Looking for the secret formula.\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nPlankton: Don't act so innocent! You know what I was up to. That's why you're pretending not to know the formula.\r\nSpongeBob: I'm not pretending. I can't believe you thought I was lying.\r\nPlankton: Hey, don't take it personally, I just assume everyone is lying.\r\nSpongeBob: That is a horrible way to live your life.\r\nPlankton: Whatever.\r\nSpongeBob: It is. And if we're gonna be on the same team--\r\nPlankton: Maybe I don't wanna be on a te-am! You think of that?!\r\nSpongeBob: But, Plankton, everything's better when you're part of a team.\r\nPlankton: You're not gonna start singing, are you?  Oh, brother.\r\nPlankton: All right, you can put me down  Well,  that's one minute of my life I'll never get back.\r\nSpongeBob: Not without a time machine.\r\nPlankton: Wait a minute, hold that thought.  Now back up.\r\nSpongeBob: Enihcam emit a tuohtiw ton.\r\nPlankton: Slow down.\r\nSpongeBob: Not without a time machine.\r\nPlankton: Hmm. Yes.  SpongeBob, you're a genius!\r\nSpongeBob: I am?\r\nPlankton: If we build a time machine, we can go back to before the formula disappeared. Before society broke down. Before we became the hunted.\r\nSpongeBob: That sounds great, Plankton, but how do we build a time machine?\r\nPlankton: Well, first we'll need a computer powerful enough to calculate the intricacies of time travel.\r\nSpongeBob: Where would we get one of those?\r\nPlankton: Hmm.  There she is, my computer wife. They've got her tied up in the back room. I've never seen this many people at The Chum Bucket.\r\nSpongeBob: I've never seen anyone there.\r\nPlankton: Now was that really necessary?\r\nSpongeBob: 'Cause the food's really bad.\r\nPlankton: Oh, come on, really?\r\nSpongeBob: Shh!  How are we gonna sneak past those guards?\r\nPlankton: Hmm.\r\nFish: Well, what do we have here?\r\nSpongeBob: We better hurry. Those guys really hate tires.\r\nPlankton: We'll never get in, the door's locked.\r\nSpongeBob: Hmm. Wait. The window is open. Come on, Plankton, it's time for some teamwork. Give me a boost.\r\nPlankton: Okay. Wait a minute. No!\r\nPlankton: Ya there?\r\nSpongeBob: Just a little higher, Plankton. Plankton?\r\nPlankton: Why don't you boost me up instead?\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah, good thinking.\r\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob, come on.\r\nSpongeBob: We're in.\r\nPlankton: There's a guard over there, camera pans to show Patrick sleeping on a chair Let's get take key from around his neck. We're gonna have to be very quiet. Let's walk on the tips of our toes.  Will you stop playing that tiny piano?!  You're gonna get us caught.\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\r\nPlankton: Now just reach over and grab it.\r\nPatrick: What? Huh? Who goes there?\r\nPlankton: Stop! Pull it over his head!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh.\r\nPlankton: Stop. Stop. Stop!  Let me get up there.  Help me.\r\nPatrick: What? Huh?!\r\nSpongeBob: No! Plankton, help!  I'll rock him, you tell him a bedtime story.\r\nPlankton: Uh, uh. Once upon a time, there was a big, fat, pink idiot who went to sleep. The end!\r\nPatrick: Nice try, but it's gonna take more than that to--\r\nKaren: I told you, I don't have the formula, you monsters!\r\nPlankton: Hey, baby, how are you?\r\nKaren: Plankton! My hero! You must need something, otherwise you wouldn't have come back.\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton has a plan to save Bikini Bottom.\r\nKaren: Doesn't matter, Plankton. Krabs knows all your plans. He's been through my hard drive looking for the secret formula.\r\nPlankton: Eh, I never had it, but we're going to get it. We're gonna go back in time and steal the formula before it disappeared.\r\nKaren: Time travel. Where are you gonna find a computer that can do that? Wait a minute.\r\nSpongeBob: I've never carried a head before.\r\nPlankton: You'll get used to it.\r\nSpongeBob: It's still warm.\r\nFish: So you won't talk, huh? Let some air out of it.\r\nSpongeBob: Is this where we're gonna build our time machine?\r\nPlankton: Sure. It's got everything we need. A photo booth, a cuckoo clock,  some day old chips. Now all we have to do is build it.  Oh, no, you don't.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, my pitch pipe.\r\nPlankton: Uh, I need it for the time machine.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, okay.\r\nPlankton: Installed!  I did it!\r\nSpongeBob: No. We did it.\r\nPlankton: Wait. We did do it. As a te-am.\r\nSpongeBob: A team.\r\nPlankton: Whatever.\r\nSpongeBob: Okay, now for the brains.\r\nKaren: Okay, Plankton, this is it. It's gonna take all my processors and energy to power this time machine. So, if you have anything you wanna tell me, you better tell me now.\r\nPlankton: Well, Karen. I know I've taken you for granted all these years and I... I just wanted to say... I'm glad you're on my te-am.\r\nKaren: Oh, Sheldon. That's the sweetest thing you've ever s--\r\nSpongeBob: Plankton, are you crying?\r\nPlankton: No, no, no, it's just one of the hazards of having a giant eyeball.  There's always stuff getting in there. Anyway,  where were we?  Say \"cheese.\"\r\nSpongeBob: Cheese!\r\nPlankton: According to my calculations, the Krusty Krab should be right here.\r\nSpongeBob: What's that over there?\r\nFuture Patrick: SpongeBob?\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\r\nFuture Patrick: Is it really you?\r\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick. It's--\r\nFuture Patrick: Finally! The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!\r\nSpongeBob: Great Krabby Patty Famine? Oh, what year is this?\r\nFuture Patrick: It's Thursday.\r\nPlankton: According to my calculations, we've only gone 4 days into the future.\r\nSpongeBob: Where is everybody?\r\nFuture Patrick: They all gave up on you! But not me!  'Cause I'm not very smart.\r\nSpongeBob: Where is the Krusty Krab?\r\nFuture Patrick: Right where it's always been.\r\nSpongeBob: I think we may be lost in time, Plankton. Maybe we should ask this guy for directions. Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us when we are?\r\nBubbles: Who dares disturb the one who watches?\r\nSpongeBob: The one who watches? Your name is \"The one who watches\"?\r\nBubbles: No! My true name is \"Bubbles.\"\r\nPlankton: \"Bubbles\"?  Wha-what kind of a name is \"Bubbles\"?\r\nBubbles: It is my ancient dolphin name.\r\nSpongeBob: So what's a dolphin doing out here in the middle of space?\r\nBubbles: My kind have been watching and protecting the galaxy for--  Hmm. 10,000 years.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, so you're the one keeping the meteors from hitting us.\r\nBubbles: Yes, I am. And I could really do with a potty break, would you mind keeping an eye on things?\r\nSpongeBob: Sure thing but uh, what am I keeping my eye on?\r\nPlankton: What are you doing?\r\nSpongeBob: I'm watching.\r\nPlankton: We don't even know what we're even watching for.\r\nSpongeBob: Maybe we should split up the work load.  You watch the one with the big red eye,  and I'll watch the one with the ringy thingies, like a team.\r\nPlankton: Okay, mine's moving.\r\nSpongeBob: Mine, too.\r\nPlankton: No, this doesn't seem right. Should we call Bubbles?\r\nSpongeBob: Let's give him a minute. He's been holding it for 10,000 years.  I'm pretty sure that wasn't supposed to happen!  Come on, Plankton we gotta clean this up before Bubbles gets back!\r\nBubbles: Much better, yes. You two are free to go.  What happened to Saturn and to Jupiter?!  You were supposed to--  keep them from smashing into each other!\r\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\r\nBubbles: Now--  I am going to lose my job! And you... will lose your lives.\r\nSpongeBob: Hey, quarter me!\r\nPast SpongeBob: Plankton?!\r\nPast Plankton: SpongeBob!?\r\nPast SpongeBob: Plankton?!\r\nPast Plankton: SpongeBob?! Who are you two supposed to be?\r\nPlankton: I'm you from the future.\r\nSpongeBob: And I'm him from the future!\r\nPast Plankton: So you traveled back through time to help me? Great thinking!\r\nSpongeBob: Nope. He's helping me.\r\nPast SpongeBob: But he's the enemy.\r\nSpongeBob: Was the enemy. Now we're a team.\r\nPast Plankton: What, a te-am?\r\nPlankton: A team! All right, go get the formula.\r\nPast SpongeBob: What have I become?\r\nSpongeBob: All right, Plankton.\r\nPast SpongeBob: Do you have flying boat mobiles in the future?\r\nPlankton: We only came back from the day after tomorrow, dim wit.\r\nPast SpongeBob: Are there rocket packs?\r\nPast SpongeBob: Did they outlaw clothes in the future?\r\nPlankton: No!\r\nPast SpongeBob: Then why are you naked?\r\nPlankton: 'Cause they don't make clothes in my size.\r\nSpongeBob: Hold still you!\r\nPast SpongeBob: If you're from the future, what am I gonna say next?\r\nPlankton: Something moronic?\r\nPast SpongeBob: Wow!\r\nPlankton: Hey, hurry up over there!\r\nPast Plankton: Uh oh, that ain't good.\r\nComputer Voice: Initiating Lockdown Sequence.\r\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get outta here.\r\nSpongeBob: Got it!\r\nPlankton: Come on!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, that was crazy.\r\nPlankton: So that's what teamwork is. All those years, I tried to make you mine and I finally did it. I mean, we did it!\r\nBurger Beard: And so, it would seem that our heroes have accomplished all they had set out to do.\r\nAndy: Now that's an ending.\r\nSeagull: Woohoo!\r\nKyle: Andy, cue the music.\r\nAndy: ♪ Ooooh... ♪\r\nBurger Beard: Oh, no. That's not the end.\r\nKyle: So, you mean the ending might be even happier?\r\nBurger Beard: Land ho!\r\nBurger Beard: Yeah! All right, you feathered rats, time to shove off!\r\nAndy: What? Why?\r\nBurger Beard: Well, I can't have you pooping all over my restaurant, can I?\r\nAndy: Restaurant? I thought this was a pirate ship.\r\nBurger Beard: Oh, it is. But it is also:...  A-ha! My very own food truck.\r\nSeagull #1: A what?\r\nBurger Beard: Uh, you know, a restaurant on wheels.\r\nSeagull #2: Like a garbage truck?\r\nAndy: Hmm.\r\nBurger Beard: No! Are you trying to scare away my customers?!\r\nSeagull #3: Well, we're not leaving until we see how the story ends.\r\nBurger Beard: No problem. You guys like a little snack while you wait?\r\nSeagull #3: Sure I'll take a curdled milk.\r\nAndy: How 'bout a fish head?\r\nSeagull #3: And a french fry covered in sand.\r\nBurger Beard: Who wants some hot wings?\r\nAndy: Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?!\r\nBurger Beard: Which one of you is next?\r\nSeagull: You're crazy, man! You're crazy!\r\nKyle: Bye-bye, Mr. Poop. Now I can get my golden sticker.  Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate. I wouldn't go in there if I were you.\r\nBurger Beard: Boo!\r\nKyle: I can't fly without my feathers.\r\nCab driver: Where to, Mac?\r\nKyle: Just dwive.\r\nPatrick: Uhh... Squidward?\r\nSquidward: Still out of Krabby Patties.\r\nPatrick: Does anyone have a picture of ketchup?\r\nSandy: I done figured it out!  We have angered the sandwich gods and only a sacrifice will appease them!\r\nBig Fish: Oh, that sounds reasonable.\r\nSandy: Soon, our post-apoca-whatchamacallit will be over and Krabby Patties will rain down from above!\r\nMr. Krabs: Rain down? Well that's no good! How will I get me money?!\r\nNat: Oh, you don't like that idea?  Then we'll sacrifice you!\r\nSpongeBob: It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice on an empty stomach.  Who wants a Krabby Patty?\r\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, is that me formuler?  Oh, happy day.  I've missed you so much. Where was it? Where'd you find it?\r\nSpongeBob: Well, Plankton and I built a time machine out of an old photo booth and then we added--\r\nPatrick: Cheese!\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, wait!\r\nMr. Krabs: It's okay, everyone. The post-apocalypse is almost over!  Ain't that right SpongeBob?  \"Eugene, Eat My sSub-aquatic Air Bubbles! Love, Plankton?! \"\r\nPlankton: You grabbed the wrong bottle!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs: That's okay, SpongeBob. We'll just have to sacrifice the two of you then! Prepare them for the sacrifice!\r\nPatrick: I bring a message from the dawn of time!\r\nSpongeBob: What is it, Patrick?\r\nPatrick: Run!\r\nSquidward: Squidasaurus Rex!\r\nSpongeBob: Well, Plankton, I guess we failed to accomplish our goals.\r\nPlankton: We?\r\nSpongeBob: But, even failure hurts a little less when you do it as a team, right?\r\nPlankton: This is all your fault!\r\nSpongeBob: My fault?!\r\nPlankton: You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula!\r\nSpongeBob: I didn't know there were two bottles.\r\nPlankton: Of course you didn't! 'Cause you got cotton candy for brains!  No, seriously, he really does.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess in the first place if you weren't so selfish and evil!\r\nPlankton: I was selfish and evil until you ruined everything with your teamwork!\r\nSpongeBob: You take that back!\r\nPlankton: You are the worst teammate ever!\r\nSpongeBob: No!\r\nCustomer: Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing garbage and recycling!\r\nSpongeBob: Look at me. Why, I've become like all of you. Savage. Fear-ridden. Selfish. An entire town of formerly good citizens, turned into heartless freaks, bent on their own self-prever...Self-preter...\r\nMob Member: \"Preservation?\"\r\nSpongeBob: Yes! We've become alienated from each other. Each one an island unto himself, concerned only with ourselves. And in the name of all fishhood, I am not about to let that happen!  And so, if a sacrifice is needed to restore Bikini Bottom to its former glory...  then I am willing to take one for the team!\r\nSquidward: (gloats) You heard him!\r\nMr. Krabs: Let the sacrifice begin!\r\nSquidasaurus Rex: And I thought my friends were primitive.\r\nMr. Krabs: Don't cry, me boy. Everything's gonna be fine. For us.\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, I'm not crying, Mr. Krabs.  I smell Krabby Patties!\r\nMr. Krabs: That's right. Keep thinking happy thoughts. Now!  The boy's right.\r\nFred: My leg!\r\nMr. Krabs: I smell 'em, too. Ok SpongeBob, Go Get It!\r\nSquidward: Wait. You mean we can just take this stuff off?\r\nMr. Krabs: Go find that Krabby Patty!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, everybody! I've got some Krabby Patty orders to fill!  It's coming from over there!  Come on, guys! I think it's just over this hill!\r\nSquidward: How do you expect us to go up to the surface?! We won't be able to breathe!\r\nCustomer: All right. All secondary characters, come with me.\r\nSquidward: Yeah, I'm with you guys.\r\nMr. Krabs: No way, Squidward.  You're going up there with us.\r\nPatrick: My feet hurt.\r\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you don't have feet.\r\nPatrick: Well, it's not fair. You have feet. Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.\r\nSquidward: Actually, I have four feet.\r\nSpongeBob: It's not about feet.\r\nSquidward: What is it about then?\r\nSpongeBob: It's about being a team and sticking together no matter what.\r\nSquidward: The only way we're going up there is if some fairy godmother shows up and helps us breathe air.\r\nSpongeBob: Bubbles!\r\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you know this guy?\r\nSpongeBob: Don't hurt us! We're sorry we got you fired!\r\nBubbles: Hurt you?  Why, I traveled back through time to thank you. I've been stuck in that job for eons. I needed a change, but I was too afraid to go for it.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.\r\nBubbles: Now, it is my turn to help. I can get you safely to the surface. Now--  Quick, all of you. Get in my mouth.\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, guys. Let's go.\r\nSquidward: There's no way I'm climbing into some dolphin's mouth.\r\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, this guy just wants a free lunch.\r\nSpongeBob: Guys, if Bubbles has the courage to quit his dead end nowhere job and travel back through time to help us, then we need to have the courage to--\r\nMr. Krabs: Well, I never thought I'd be eaten by a dolphin.\r\nSpongeBob: No, if he was eating us, he'd be chewing us up and we'd be going down there. This is what you call \"riding in style.\"\r\nSquidward: Not a lot of leg room in here.\r\nPatrick: Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!\r\nPlankton: Note to self: Never stow away in a gym sock.\r\nPatrick: What's happening? I feel tingly.\r\nSquidward: Ow, my neck.\r\nBubbles: I've done all I can. The rest is up to you.\r\nSpongeBob: Thank you, Bubbles!\r\nBubbles: Farewell, SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Farewell, Bubbles!\r\nBubbles: Now, to update my--  Hmm-m-m  R-r-résumé!\r\nSandy: Ah, fresh air. Oh, how I've missed you.\r\nSquidward: Ugh! This place smells awful!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, guys. Let's get the Krabby Patty formula and save Bikini Bottom.  Whoa. What is this place?\r\nMr. Krabs: I have a bad feeling about this.\r\nPatrick: Maybe this guy knows where we are. He looks smart. He's got five heads.\r\nSpongeBob: Uh, Sir? Could you tell us where to find a Krabby Patty?\r\nPatrick: Hey, my friend's talking to you!\r\nSpongeBob: What?  A giant, hairy porpoise! It's beached! It's suffering. Poor thing.\r\nSandy: Y'all, those aren't porpoises.\r\nMr. Krabs: All hands on deck!\r\nSandy: Oh, brother.\r\nMr. Krabs: We need to get these guys back in the water!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, push!\r\nMr. Krabs: Put your back into it!\r\nSpongeBob: Come on, push!\r\nSquidward: Well, I guess this is where that horrible smell was coming from.\r\nBeach girl: Whoa!\r\nSpongeBob: Excuse me, do you know where we can get a Krabby Patty around here?\r\nBeach boy: Invaders!\r\nSpongeBob: Uh-oh!\r\nBeach boy: You get off of my sister's sand castle!\r\nBeach girl: Mom!\r\nPatrick: Ahh...Where have you been all my life?!\r\nSquidward: Whoa! Whoa!\r\nFemale Sunbather: Oh Frank...that's so good.\r\nFreckled Boy: Gross!\r\nPatrick: Oh, hey Squidward.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy! The Krabby Patty! I think I see where it's coming from!\r\nSpongeBob and Sandy: Whoa!\r\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you would not believe the size of the ice creams here.  I wonder what other giant snacks they have.  Cotton candy!\r\nSpongeBob: Wow.\r\nSandy: If you ate all that, you'd have enough energy to run around the whole world.\r\nSquidward: Ugh! When is the sugar gonna wear off?\r\nSpongeBob: Hey guys. I smell Krabby Patties!  I think it's this way!  Now what?\r\nSquidward: We're never gonna make it!\r\nSpongeBob: We're doing it guys!\r\nSandy: Hold on!\r\nBaby: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob: Lean!\r\nMr. Krabs: What the--?\r\nSpongeBob: What? \"Home of the Krabby Patty?\" But the Krusty Krab is the home of the Krabby Patty! Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?!\r\nMr. Krabs: $8.99 for a Krabby Patty?! Why didn't I think of that?  You.  Cease and desist that unauthorized patty flippin'!\r\nSpongeBob: Yeah. That's my job!\r\nBurger Beard: How did you get here? You cannot breathe air.\r\nSpongeBob: Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole and then--\r\nBurger Beard: Wait! Wait.  That's not in the book.\r\nMr. Krabs: Book?\r\nBurger Beard: There's no magical dolphin in this story.\r\nMr. Krabs: What story?\r\nBurger Beard: The story of how Bikini Bottom was brought to its knees when its beloved Krabby Patty formula was stolen by me, Burger Beard.\r\nPatrick: How does it end?\r\nBurger Beard: Well, let me see. It looks like, um, Burger Beard becomes the richest food truck proprietor in all of the land.\r\nSpongeBob: But how did you steal the formula?\r\nBurger Beard: That was easy. I simply rewrote the story and...  Poof!\r\nMr. Krabs: Me formuler!\r\nSquidward: What do you mean rewrote the story?\r\nBurger Beard: Watch this.  The brave and handsome Burger Beard banished...  our poor heroes to be stranded on Pelican Island!  The end!\r\nSpongeBob: Oh, this looks bad! And these guys look hungry!  Look out!\r\nSquidward: Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.\r\nMr. Krabs: Here. Take Squidward, you vile beasts!\r\nPatrick: I wanna be on a new team. This one's broken.\r\nSpongeBob: Sandy, you're smart.  You have any ideas?\r\nSandy: I ain't been too smart since I found this old piece of paper!\r\nSpongeBob: What?\r\nMr. Krabs: Incoming!\r\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute!  Now all we need is some ink...  Oh, which Squidward has helpfully provided.\r\nSquidward:  It happens when I'm nervous.\r\nMr. Krabs: Whatever you're gonna do, make it quick! They're closing in on us!\r\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna write us an ending.\r\nPatrick: Will it be a happy ending?\r\nSpongeBob: It's gonna be super-powered!\r\nPlankton: I'll show you a happy ending.\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Da-da-da-dee!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick!\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Huh?  Hey, I got feet!\r\nCustomer: Ugh... what is in these things?\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: We'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Clear the area, citizens. There is going to be some serious...  ...aft-kicking here.\r\nBurger Beard: But... I banished you.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Sour Note?\r\nKyle: My tiny little eardrums!\r\nBurger Beard: Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on! Wait! Wait! Customers! WAIT PLEASE!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Mr. Superawesomeness, take him down.\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Mmmmmmm!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Uhh, Maybe we should have picked a better superpower for you, Patrick.\r\nBurger Beard: Let's see you get out of this one!\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Ka-ching!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Get ready for the Invincibubble!\r\nBurger Beard: No! My book!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: All right, team. Time for hands in the middle!\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Yes! Huh?  Oh yeah.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Great job, guys, we did it!\r\nPatrick: Huh?\r\nSandy/The Rodent: What?\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Sandy? Is that you?\r\nSandy/The Rodent: You can call me The Rodent! Hi-yah!\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness : Hey. Where'd the pirate go?\r\nSquidward/Sour Note: Hmm. Uh...\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Hmm. It looks like Burger Beard forgot the first rule of mobile fry-cooking: Always batten down your grease traps.\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Follow that grease, team!\r\nBurger Beard: There she blows.\r\nBurger Beard: Oh no, you don't.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Whoa!  He's after the book! Sandy, use your squirrel powers!\r\nSandy/The Rodent: Roger that!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Oh, she's never gonna make it!  Huh? Everyone lean!\r\nAndy: That's what you get.\r\nBurger Beard: Come here.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: The book! Sour Note!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: All right, Burger Beard, prepare to be teamworked!\r\nBurger Beard: I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Uh, I don't get it.\r\nSquidward/Sour Note: Because you're a sponge.\r\nBurger Beard: Duh.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Oh. Get him, The Rodent!\r\nSandy/The Rodent: Consider him roasted!  Huh?  Aw, nuts, I'm all out of nuts!\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomenesss: Justice is best...soft served.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick, I should have never doubted your powers!\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: I can't think of a sweeter way to go.\r\nBurger Beard: Ha! It's all MINE!\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Not so fast, Booger Beard!  Me formuler.  Huh?\r\nBurger Beard: This will make you feel a little butter.\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Not melted butter!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Mr. Krabs!\r\nBurger Beard: Voila!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Uh-oh.  Huh?\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: They're beautiful.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick!\r\nBurger Beard: I gotcha!\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: SpongeBob!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick?\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Talk to me, buddy.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Is this better?\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Much. Thank you. But the discomfort I feel in my eyes is nothing compared to the shame I feel for letting down the Patty. For letting down Bikini Bottom.\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: No, Patrick, we blew it, as a team.\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Nope, this one's on you.\r\nPlankton: Where do you think you're going?\r\nBurger Beard: Why don't you get going, little fella, before you hurt yourself?\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Plankton?\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: It's Plank-Ton!  Come on down from there, little fella. You wouldn't wanna get hurt. Huh?  Come out, come out wherever you are. Huh?  Yah! My eye!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: He's getting away!\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles?\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: The formula, please.\r\nBurger Beard: Come on. Team up with me. We'll be rich and powerful! Huh?\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: No, thanks. I'm already part of a teamwork.\r\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Can we do hands in the middle again?\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Yes, we can, Patrick. But this time there's one more hand to go in the middle.  Plankton?\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Hmm.\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Oh, no.\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Here you go, Krabs.\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Huh?\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: She's all yours.\r\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: This doesn't have another insulting note in it, does it?\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: No, that's the old me. The one who turned his back on everything important just to have that formula all to himself. But I realize now that keeping something to myself is... ...selfish.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Especially when that something is the Krabby Patty. Okay, everybody, let's get back to Bikini Bottom and...  Oh, no! I don't have the page!\r\nSandy/The Rodent: Oh, no!\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: It must be back on Pelican Island!\r\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Don't worry. I thought of everything.  All right, SpongeBob, take us home.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Thanks. Squidward!\r\nSquidward/Sour Note: Oh, yeah.\r\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Come on, it's time to go back and open up The Krusty Krab!\r\nSquidward/Sour Note: Are you out of your patty-flipping mind?  I'll never leave this place! I mean, look at me. I'm a god!\r\nSpongeBob/Invinicibubble: No, Squidward, you're a cashier.\r\nSquidward/Sour Note: Wait a minute! What? No!  Well, it was fun while it lasted.\r\nSpongeBob: Don't be sad, Squidward. I left you a little surprise under your shirt!\r\nSquidward: Rock-hard abs!  Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.\r\nSpongeBob: Aw, shucks.\r\nScooter: Excuse us! We'd like 3,000 Krabby Patties Please!\r\nSquidward: That sound must mean things are back to normal.\r\nSpongeBob: Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?  First one's for you, Gary. Extra mayo, just the way you like it.\r\nSpongeBob: A-ha! Caught you red-handed! Gary hates mayo!  Plankton! Up to your old tricks again already, eh?\r\nPlankton: Hey, I'm just putting things back the way they were.\r\nSpongeBob: What do you have to say about this, Gary?\r\nPlankton: Oh, shrimp.\r\nSpongeBob: See you later, te-am-mate!\r\nSeagull: Now can we sing it?\r\nKyle: Pwease, Mr. Piwate?\r\nBurger Beard: Oh, Kyle... How can I say no to you?  Are you ready, kids?!\r\nSeagulls: Aye-aye, Captain.\r\nBurger Beard: Uh, what did you say? There's sand in my ears and I can't hear you!\r\nSeagulls: Aye-aye, Captain!\r\nBubbles: Stop it. That's enough!  Silence!\r\nSeagull: Oh, man. I like that song.
