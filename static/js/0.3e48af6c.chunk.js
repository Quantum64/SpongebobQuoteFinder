Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?\nSpongeBob: We also offer lessons for beginners.\nSquidward: Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble?  Here's your 25 cents!  Watch and learn.  Uhh... wait, wait, wait.  One more time. Here. Wait.  Uhh... Just a mere warm-up.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, remember the technique.  Squidward, technique!

See, it is all in the technique.\nPatrick: Yeah, technique.\nSquidward: Technique? Hah. SpongeBob, you don't think I created that  beautiful work of art with your help?  Come on, it's in my genes.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes!\nSquidward: Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I rock.\nSpongeBob: Squidward!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!\nSquidward: Hello, my friends.

Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose!  Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no.  We blew it, pants.\nPants: What do you mean, \"we?\"\nSpongeBob: Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?!\nJennifer: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen.\nSpongeBob: Ouch.\nDexter: No, I am. I got sand in my buns.\nFrank: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.\nAll: What happened to you?\nSpongeBob: I lost my best friend.\nAll: How?\nSpongeBob: When I ripped...  my pants.  I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I  ripped my pants.\nAll: \u266aWhen big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and  ripped his pants!\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aI know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...\u266a\nAll: \u266aOr sand in your buns!\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aNow I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret.

Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!\nSpongeBob: Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.\nPatrick: So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...\nSpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!\nPatrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.\nSpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!\nPatrick: Alien hunting! Alien hunting!\nSpongeBob: Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too.

Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.\nMr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.\nSpongeBob: Who's that?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.\nSpongeBob: \u266aI'm ready!

I wasn't ready for those blessed boots.\nMr. Krabs: Poor lad.\nTom: Excuse me?\nMr. Krabs: I didn't do it!  Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?\nTom: Yeah, I'm ready to order.\nMr. Krabs: What'll ya have?\nTom: I'll take a .\nMr. Krabs: What did you say?\nTom: I said, I'll take a .\nMr. Krabs: Huh?\nSpongeBob: I heard his order, Mr. Krabs.

The deed is done.\nSpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.\nSpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I do, son.  Here's the paycheck I owe you.  Plus a bonus!  Well, there's your paycheck anyway.  I need a vacation.\nSpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.\nPearl: Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!\nMr. Krabs: Darling, I won't.

This is your natural habitat.  This is your wide open range.  These are your amber waves.  And thisoh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule!

Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?\nSpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.\nSandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright.\nSpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye.  I won't be needing these.  Buzz, buzz, buzz.\nSquidward: He took off his pants.\nSandy: I'll give him a week.\nSquidward: I'll give him eleven minutes.\nPatrick: Patrick sad!\nSpongeBob: I'm home. I'm home! I'm home!

I'm moving out of this neighborhood!\nRealtor Lady: Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles!  I can sell your home in a heartbeat.\nSquidward: Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.\nPatty: No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.\nSquidward: Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say \"neighbors?\"\nPatty: Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.\nSquidward: Neighbors. Uhh...\nPatty: Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite...\nSpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum?\nSquidward: Drum? What drum?  This is just my wig case! See?  Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!\nSpongeBob: Squidward! You need bed rest!  I'll keep you safe until you're well again.\nSquidward: Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Wednesday?\nSquidward: Why, it's Opposite Day!  You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!\nSpongeBob: Does everybody know about Opposite Day?\nSquidward: Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?\nSpongeBob: Oh, a game.\nSquidward: Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?\nSpongeBob: Quiet and out of the way! Yay!\nSquidward: Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.\nSpongeBob: I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day.  I'm not ready!\nSquidward: So long, chum.  And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: Gary!

That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me!\nSquidward: If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house!\nPatrick: Isn't it beautiful?\nSpongeBob: On Opposite Day it is.\nSquidward: Out of the way, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!\nPatrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite, too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!  I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.\nSpongeBob: Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite...  ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better.  Now you try.\nPatrick: Okay.  I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.\nSpongeBob: After you, Mr. Squidward.\nPatrick: Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward.\nSpongeBob: You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward.\nSquidward: Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be \"Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!\"\nPatty: Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person!  Hello, Mr...  Uh... Mr. Tentacles?\nSpongeBob: Yes, please come in.\nPatty: It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, everyone says that.\nPatty: Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.\nSpongeBob: Positive things! Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.\nPatty: Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.\nSpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?\nPatty: Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...\nSpongeBob: Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.\nPatty: Oh my, this painting is very nice.\nPatrick: Thank you!\nPatty: Who's that?!\nSpongeBob: I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.\nPatty: You're both Squidward?\nSpongeBob: I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're both Squidward.\nSquidward: Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet.  NO!\nPatty: Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.\nSpongeBob: Okay.\nPatty: I really don't want to hear more, thank you.\nSpongeBob: I hear you loud and clear.\nSquidward: Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two  barnacle heads  haven't harmed you in any way.\nPatty: Who are you?\nSquidward: Why, I'm Squidward!\nPatty: What kind of fool do you take me for?! He's Squidward, he's Squidward, you're Squidward?! I'm Squidward! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?\nGary: Meow.\nPatty: I'm outta here.\nSquidward: Ma'am, please! What about my house?!\nPatty: I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on earth!\nSquidward: Wait!\nSpongeBob: Don't...\nPatrick: ...Go!\nSquidward: No, no, no, no, no!\nPatty: Stop! Stop!\nSquidward: Please, sell my house!\nPatty: Never!\nSquidward: Don't leave me here!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you!\nSquidward: Let me show you guys how much I... hate you!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?\nSquidward: Happy Opposite Day!\n","10a\nCulture Shock\nMr. Krabs: Hmm...

Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month.  We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers.  Do you lubbers have any ideas?\nSpongeBob: I've got one!  A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams...  ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?\nMr. Krabs: Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment.\nSquidward: That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me!  This is the moment I've...  I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom!

The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes.  Tennis shoes. I crack myself up.\nLisa: We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...\nSpongeBob: Wow!

Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.\nPlankton: Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.\nMr. Krabs: Uhh... suit yourself.\nSpongeBob: We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs!  Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here.\nMr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight.  Or maybe scallops will fly out of my pants!

And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!\nSpongeBob: Really?\nPlankton: No, not really. Being evil is too much fun!\nMovie Man: Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.\nMr Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what\u2019s behind these screens? Solid concrete!\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.\nMr. Krabs: Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty!

He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.\nSquidward: Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame?\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.\nMr. Krabs: Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner!  Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  There might be a new face on the wall this month.\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nSquidward: That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you.\nSpongeBob: Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!\nSquidward: Need some help?  What are you doing?\nSpongeBob: Making...Krabby Patties?\nSquidward: You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of--  ...garbage.\nSpongeBob: Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!\nSquidward: I already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney!\nSpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...\nSquidward: It's a symbol that you're a chump!\nSpongeBob: No, Squidward!\nSquidward: And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award!\nSpongeBob: An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.\nSquidward: I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke!\nSpongeBob: What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!\nSpongeBob Picture: Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!\nSpongeBob: But, sir\u2026\nSpongeBob Picture: There's no room for \"buts\" in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?\nSpongeBob: Crystal, sir!\nSpongeBob Picture: Good! Now move out!\nSpongeBob: I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.\nSquidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here?\nSpongeBob: You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!\nSquidward: Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!\nSpongeBob: That can be arranged.\nSquidward: You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.\nSquidward: Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!\nSpongeBob: I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.\nSquidward: Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!\nSquidward: Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!\nSpongeBob: Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!\nSquidward: I don't need to sleep! Loser!\nSpongeBob: Well, me neither! \u202626-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.\nSquidward: I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?\nSquidward: No, how about you?\nSpongeBob: Nope!  Nighty Night.\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?\nSquidward: I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!\nSpongeBob: All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!\nSquidward: That oughta hold him!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! Why, you little\u2026!\nSpongeBob: Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!\nSquidward: So long, Sponge loser!  SpongeBob? Truce?\nSpongeBob: Truce.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!\nSpongeBob: You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.\nSquidward: Okay, let's have a good clean fight.\nSpongeBob: And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!\nSquidward: Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.\nSpongeBob: As soon as he stops shaking my hand...\nSquidward: ...I'm gonna make a run for it.\nMr. Krabs: Money, money, gonna make some money!  Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early!  Wait!\nSpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!\nSquidward: Clean tables, Mr. Krabs!\nSpongeBob: Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: What's going on here?!\nSpongeBob: It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: No!\nSquidward: Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!\nSpongeBob: Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs!  Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!\nSquidward: There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double your output, SpongeHog!\nMr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys!  Help! Help!\nFrank: Hey, free Krabby Patties!\nMr. Krabs: Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait! Wait! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties!\nSpongeBob: So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?\nSquidward: Me, me! It's me!\nMr. Krabs: Boys! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!\n","13a\nScaredy Pants\nNarrator: Halloween is no different under the waves. Pirates, skeletons, and sea monsters.  Ohh, sorry. Everyone having fun. Well, almost everyone.\nSpongeBob: Huh? Who's there?\nSpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving!\nMr. Krabs: Hold on. Don't you want to hear my annual scary story?\nSpongeBob: No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?\nMr. Krabs: Aye, the worst monster of them all.\nSpongeBob: Uhh... no.  Is it a true story?\nMr. Krabs: True as the deep blue.\nSpongeBob: Okay, maybe just a little.\nMr. Krabs: Have a seat, me boy.  Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this.  Only bigger!\nSpongeBob: Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?\nMr. Krabs: Like I was saying, the Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people's souls.\nSpongeBob: Do souls look like pickles?\nMr. Krabs: Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them... in his soul bag.\nSquidward: I've come for your pickle.\nMr. Krabs: Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year!\nSpongeBob: Humph, Squidward!\nMr. Krabs: Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you're not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants!\nSquidward: Steal your soul.\nKid: Twick-ow-tweat!\nMother: It's okay, son. That's just SpongeBob ScaredyPants.\nMrs. Puff: Happy Halloween, ScaredyPants.\nSpongeBob: The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants!  I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm sick of it.  No more ScaredyPants!\nPatrick: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn.  Rawr!\nPatrick: Hiya, SpongeBob!  Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\nSpongeBob: Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?\nPatrick: Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume.\nSpongeBob: What do you think?\nPatrick: Great! You're going as my trick-or-treat bag!\nSpongeBob: No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!\nPatrick: Uhh... something's missing. I know!  Step into these babies, Hans.  Terrifying.\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick.\nPatrick: Come on, SpongeBob. It's little kids! Little kids are easy to scare!\nKids: Trick-or-treat!\nSpongeBob: Rawr-rawr!\nKid #1: Look, it's the haunted mattress!\nSpongeBob: Okay, okay, here's your candy.\nKid #1: No, please, that was enough of a treat, thank you.\nSpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, look at my new paper ghost!  Oooh, scary.\nSpongeBob: That is it, Patrick!\nPatrick: What's it?\nSpongeBob: What's the difference between that ghost and me?\nPatrick: No, no, no wait. Don't tell me.  D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Okay, tell me.\nSpongeBob: I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary!\nPatrick: Okay, are you ready?\nSpongeBob: Remember, like this.\nPatrick: Are you sure you want to do this?\nSpongeBob: Shave me down, make me round!\nPatrick: All right, let's get to it.\nSpongeBob: What do you think?\nPatrick: Perfect. Now that's scary!  Let's go scare somebody.\nSpongeBob: Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman!\nPatrick: Oooh... I don't know who I am!\nSpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!\nPatrick: Oooh, I'm the Flying Dutchman's best friend!\nMan: Hey, don't you kids want your candy?\nPatrick: Oh, boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch.\nSpongeBob: Do you think?\nPatrick: Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!\nSpongeBob: Who should we scare next?\nPatrick: There's a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited!  Here comes someone now!\nSpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!\nKid #2: Wasn't that the Haunted Mattress?\nKid #3: I guess he's been demoted to a haunted sleeping bag!\nPearl: Oh, dad, you're embarrassing me again!\nSandy: Howdy, Squidward, I mean, Flying Dutchman. Great party, huh?\nSquidward: What are you supposed to be?\nSandy: Why, I'm a pet goldfish in a bowl!\nSquidward: I don't get it.\nPatrick: Are you ready, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, kill the lights!\nPatrick: Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Those are my street clothes!\nFlying Dutchman: Enough!\nMr. Krabs: It's the real Flying Dutchman!\nFlying Dutchman: You bet your white lily livers I'm the Flying Dutchman. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I'm going to steal your souls.  Quiet!  You had it coming, you little crybabies. Every year, people dressing up like me.  Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls.  No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.\nSpongeBob: Do you mean I'm not scary?\nFlying Dutchman: You? Scary?!  Let me tell you about scary, kid. There's all kinds of scary things in the world. Spiders are scary, uhh, I'm scary. You... you're not scary. Okay, let's get this over with.\nSandy: SpongeBob!\nFlying Dutchman: First, I gotta get rid of this stupid costume.\nSpongeBob: Hey, what do you know? I scared him!  It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody!\nPatrick: Yeah, I guess it was your pink hat.\nSpongeBob: Pink hat? Oh, that's not a hat. That's my brain.\nPatrick: Oh.\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, it grows back!\n","13b\nI Was a Teenage Gary\nSpongeBob: Exercise time is over, Gary.  We don't want you getting too thin.  Here, boy.

I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!\nSquidward: Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?\nSpongeBob: Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?\nSquidward: What's a Gary?\nSpongeBob: Not a Gary... Gary. He's my pet snail.  Say hello!\nSquidward: Yuck. You actually care for that thing?\nSpongeBob: I love Gary!\nSquidward: Well, I don't. Get somebody else.\nSpongeBob: I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick.\nSquidward: Go away?  You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?\nSpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.\nSquidward: As in, not here for three days?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.\nPatrick: Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!\nSquidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.\nSpongeBob: You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk...\nSquidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.\nSpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him.

Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers!  They're gone!\nGary: Meow.\nSquidward: This is going to be the best three days of my life.  I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob.  Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me.   The snail!

Here you go.\nSpongeBob: Aren't you going to do it?\nPurple Doctorfish: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish.\nSquidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.\nSpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma.

Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.\nSquidward: Well, you made me do it.\nSpongeBob: What's going to happen to me?\nSquidward: Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.\nSpongeBob: I don't know, I feel kind of funny!\nSquidward: I'm telling you, its all in your head.\nSquidward: He just needed water?\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you're better!\nSquidward: Oh, how touching.

Stop.\nSandy: I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: No, really! Please, stop!\nMr. Krabs: What the?

Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault! It's- it's mine! He tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen!  Give him another chance, please?\nMr. Krabs: Hmmm.  Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind.  Mmm, mammals.\nSandy: Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing.  Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about  this?\nSpongeBob: Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!\nSandy: We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.\nSpongeBob: We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh.  We can squeeze things!  Woo! How much fun was that?\nSandy: Almost some.\nSpongeBob: I know! We can act like plants.  Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.\nSandy: Wanna go to the park?\nSpongeBob: Karate sure is dumb.\nSandy: Yeah, you can say that again.\nSpongeBob: I feel dumb just thinking about it.  Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!\nSandy: You like what?\nSpongeBob: Not karate.\nSandy: Ha! I don't even know what that is.\nSpongeBob: Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...\nFisherman: Hi-yah! Hi-yah!\nSpongeBob: For a second, that sounded like.\nSandy: Karate?\nSpongeBob: Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate?  Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?\nSandy: Karate.\nSpongeBob: What did you say?\nSandy: Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich.

Hi-yah!  Is that enough?\nSpongeBob: Maybe just one more. Or two!\nSandy: Or three!\nSpongeBob: Or ten!\nSandy: Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSandy: Right!\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSandy: Right!\nSpongeBob: Time for buns!\nSandy: How about some tomatoes?\nSpongeBob: And I'll cut the cheese!\nSandy: And, what else should we slice?\nSpongeBob: More buns!\nSandy: And lettuce!\nBoth: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Phew.

Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.\nMr. Krabs: Fire ya?  I've got something else in mind.\nSandy: I love karate!\nSpongeBob: I love kara-tay!\nMr. Krabs: I love money-ay!\nSquidward: I hate all of you.\n","e15a\nSleepy Time\nSpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary.\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!\nMrs. Puff: Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?\nGary: Meow.  Meow.\nSpongeBob: This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...?\nGary: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Gary?\nGary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?\nSpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!\nGary: In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.\nSpongeBob: What does that mean?\nGary: Come.  For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm.  \"Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again.\" Emily Dickinson wrote that.\nSpongeBob: Who?\nGary: Here's one you might know.  There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.\nSpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.\nGary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?\nSpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.\nGary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!\nSpongeBob: I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey, Patrick!\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.\nPatrick: Yup.\nSpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?\nPatrick: Yup.\nSpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream.\nPatrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob.  Oh!  Shoot, that was my last quarter.\nSpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nKing: Ahem!  Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?\nSquidward: Yes, Your Highness.  SpongeBob!\nKing: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play!  Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.\nSquidward: Sponge-  Bob...\nKing: I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!\nSpongeBob: Squidward!  Huh? Huh?\nSquidward: No way.\nKing: Ahem!\nSquidward: Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.\nSpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward.\nSpongeBob: La la! La la la la la la la!\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nKing: Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?\nFish: His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.\nSquidward: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\nFish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?\nSpongeBob: So long, Squidward!\nSpongeBob: Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder...\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?\nSpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?\nSandy: Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target.\nSpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!\nSandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!\nSpongeBob: Okay!\nSandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute!\nSpongeBob: Gotcha!\nSandy: Not a parakeet! Para-  medic...\nSpongeBob: Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.  H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs.  Uhh... Mr. Krabs?\nPearl: Hello, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.\nPearl: You're just in time for the tea party!\nSpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.\nPearl: Oh. He's next door.  Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?\nSpongeBob: Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust.\nKrabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon!  You're putting up a good fight, yes you are.\nSpongeBob: Whatcha doin\u2019, Mr. Krabs?\nKrabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!\nSpongeBob: What are you talking about?\nKrabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash.  It's the mighty Moby Dollar!  Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes!  There she blows!\nSpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!\nKrabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!\nSpongeBob: This one?\nKrabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.\nSpongeBob: Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.\nKrabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!\nSpongeBob: Net ready, sir!\nKrabs: I did it!  I finally did it!\nSpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.\nKrabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nKrabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!\nSpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!\nKrabs: No!\nSpongeBob: This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?\nKrabs: Oh, SpongeBob...\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?\nKrabs: You're fired!\nSpongeBob: Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.\nPlankton: Zap!  I see you.  Zap!\nFred: My leg!\nPlankton: I see you. Zap!\nSpongeBob: Plankton!\nPlankton: I see you...  Zap!  Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty.  Crush!  Lick, lick!\nSpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!\nGary: Meow! Meow!\nSpongeBob: Gary! Gary! No!\nGary: Meow!\nPlankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.\nSpongeBob: Gary!  I've got you, Gary!\nPlankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot!  Yeah! Huh?  Yow!\nSpongeBob: I think he's got the point.\nPlankton: Waaaaaah!  Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh?  No! No! No! Not the face!\nSpongeBob: Ooh!  Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud.  Ah...\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nSandy: SpongeBob!\nKrabs: SpongeBob!\nPatrick: SpongeBob!\nPlankton: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?\nSquidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!\nSandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!\nPlankton: Take a hike!\nSquidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?\nGary: Meow!\nPatrick: Does anyone have a quarter?\n","e15b\nSuds\nSpongeBob: Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah!  A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed.  Aww, sleep tight, my little angel.  Ah, here it is.  Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep.  The fridge!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I can't get the suds,  because then I'll have to miss work!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I'm not sick. I'm going to work.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties?\nSpongeBob: Right away, sir.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse.\nGary: Meow.\nMr. Krabs: The suds?\nSpongeBob: Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir.\nMr. Krabs: Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work.\nSpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest.\nMr. Krabs: No, now go home and get some rest.  Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food!  No, wait! Wait!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I feel horrible.  Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it.  I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand.\nSandy: Hello?\nSpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sick.  Can you escort me to the doctor's?\nSandy: Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I'll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in...\nSpongeBob: Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks.  Coming.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?\nSpongeBob: I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.\nPatrick: What? Oh, you can't go!\nSpongeBob: Why not, Patrick?\nPatrick: I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!\nSpongeBob: It can't be as horrible as the suds.\nPatrick: Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well, first, they make you sit in the waiting room.\nSpongeBob: Is that the horrible part, Patrick?\nPatrick: No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines!  Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.\nSpongeBob: No!\nPatrick: Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it...  Ssssss!\nSpongeBob: No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No!  Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.\nPatrick: Exactly.\nSpongeBob: You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?\nPatrick: What else are friends for?  It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick.  Voil\xe0!  Feel better?\nSpongeBob: I don't know.\nPatrick: Help, I'm shrinking!  No! Please don't hurt me!\nSpongeBob: No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!\nPatrick: You think so?\nSpongeBob: Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!\nPatrick: And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.\nSpongeBob: My fingers are too big for the buttons.  Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me?\nPatrick: Sure, patient SpongeBob.  Hello, Sandy?\nSandy: Hiya, Patrick.\nPatrick: I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.\nSandy: I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital.\nPatrick: Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.\nSandy: Well, I'm coming over to take a look. I'll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot...\nPatrick: Oh, yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy!  Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! Ah! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor!  Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please.  Feeling better?\nSpongeBob: Uh-uh.\nPatrick: Feeling better yet?\nSpongeBob: Not really.\nPatrick: How...about...now?\nSpongeBob: I don't...think so.\nPatrick: Feeling better?\nSpongeBob: No.\nPatrick: How about now?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nPatrick: How about now?\nSpongeBob: Uh-uh.\nSandy: Hello, SpongeBob?\nPatrick: Uh-oh, it's Sandy.  There's no one home.\nSandy: Patrick, you open this door.  Patrick, sometimes I just don't understand you.  Hey!  Okay, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?\nPatrick: Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.\nSandy: Okay, now tell me,  since when do you have two houses?\nPatrick: Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.\nSandy: Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when does your house have feet?\nPatrick: This is my mobile home.\nSpongeBob: Hiya, Sandy.\nPatrick: Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.\nSandy: Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor.\nPatrick: No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.\nSpongeBob: Ahh...\nSandy: See? He's even worse than I thought.\nPatrick: What do you mean? He's fine.\nSpongeBob: I'm okay, Sandy, really.\nSandy: I'm taking you to the doctor right now.\nPatrick: Hey, that's my patient!  You can't take him to the doctor's.\nSandy: Don't be silly, Patrick!\nPatrick: He's mine!\nSandy: SpongeBob, you'll be better soon.\nPatrick: I'll save you!\nSpongeBob: I'm better, guys! Really!\nSandy: Now look what you've done, Patrick!\nPatrick: What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up.\nSandy: You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor!\nPatrick: I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Guys!\nSandy: Huh?\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I can't stop now!  Help me!\nMr. Krabs: Shiny dimes.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob?  Stop! SpongeBob! Stop!\nPurple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. SquarePants, it seems you have the suds. Are you ready for your treatment?\nSpongeBob: You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?\nPurple Doctorfish: No, silly, you get the sponge treatment. Oh, Hans?\nSpongeBob: Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!  This tickles!  I can smell again!  Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah!  I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!\nHans: Here is your lollipop.\nPatrick: A lollipop?  Hey, doc, I\u2019ve got the suds, too.\nPurple Doctorfish: Oh, yes, Dr. Patrick, we have a special treatment for you.\nPatrick: Hey! Hey, wait!  Ouch! That hurts!  Wait, this doesn't seem right!\n","16a\nValentine's Day\nSpongeBob: Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom!\nSandy: Happy Valentine's Day, SpongeBob.

Cotton candy!\nCotton Candy Seller: Hey, get away! Hey!\nSandy: Sandy to SpongeBob.  Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here.\nSandy: I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?\nSpongeBob: Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.\nSandy: You are such a kidder, Sandy out. That SpongeBob...  Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!\nPatrick: So if it's not cotton candy, then what is it? I can't take it!\nSpongeBob: You'll have to guess!\nPatrick: This tent?\nSpongeBob: No.\nPatrick: This guy?\nSpongeBob: No.\nPatrick: This paramecium?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nPatrick: Heh, you're a sly one.

At first, a handshake doesn't seem like much, but really it's the thought that counts\u2026\nFran: Hey, SpongeBob, I just wanted to thank you for this box of chocolates.\nSpongeBob: Uh, no problem, Fran.\nPatrick: And even though I was expecting more...\nDave: Thanks for the roses, SpongeBob.

It's only garbage?\nSpongeBob: Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of...\nSquidward: ...garbage.\nSpongeBob: So you don't want it?\nSquidward: Right!\nSpongeBob: Does that mean I can have it?\nSquidward: Yes, by all means, take it.  Hello?\nSpongeBob: You sure?\nSquidward: Yes! For the final time, I don't want that paper.

Squidward?  Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward.\nSquidward: SpongeBob...  What in the world are you giggling about?\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just...  ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper!\nSquidward: How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper?

Landing just in time for the bullfight!  Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro...  Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a mustache.  Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache. A pirate with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I'm a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I am not a pirate.\nSquidward: Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper.  How did he do that?\nSpongeBob: Look, Gary, oral-gami.\nKids: Bird! Yay!  Snowflake, yay!  Paper dolls, yay!\nSquidward: Hey, that little paper does seem like fun.  What am I saying?! I am such an idiot.  SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun?  Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun.  Erosion.  Mitosis.  See, I can have fun taking a bath.  Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything.  I'll prove to him that paper is not fun!  I'm having fun, la-la-la...\nSpongeBob: Isn't this great? La-la-la-la-la...  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\nSquidward: Okay, SpongeBob, top this one.  Hey, Lil' Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?\nLil' Squidward: I don't know, but have you looked in the mirror lately?\nSquidward: What? What did you...?\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try.  Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper?\nPaper: What happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?\nSpongeBob: I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?\nPaper: It was all washed up!\nSpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\nSquidward: Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nSquidward: Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper!\nSpongeBob: Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original.\nSquidward: What? I didn't play any wrong notes.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, see, you're playing it like this...  ...when ordinarily it goes like this...  I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself.  Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?\nSquidward: Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it!  Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go...\nSpongeBob: I can't!\nSquidward: What do you mean you can't?\nSpongeBob: I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever.\nSquidward: I never said anything like that!\nSpongeBob: Sure you did, Squidward, look.\nSquidward: Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me\u2026 ever!\nSpongeBob: Wanna see it again?\nSquidward: No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise.  Maybe I should get going.\nSquidward: Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something.  Yeah-yeah, something, something...  A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum.  I'm going to make you an offer.\nSpongeBob: Wow, pocket lint!  You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...\nSquidward: Not the lint, the rubber band!\nSpongeBob: The rubber band? Do I dare?\nSquidward: Oh, dare, dare!\nSpongeBob: Okay...  Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise.\nSquidward: Listen, you!  You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal.  Gotta get that paper.\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\nSquidward: Trade...\nSpongeBob: Hey, listen...\nSquidward: Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it.  I've given you everything but the shirt off my back.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise.\nSquidward: Okay, the shirt!  Take it! Take my shirt!\nSpongeBob: Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade!  I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, \u2018cause this is all I'll need?\nSquidward: You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage.  I got it! Haha and you can't have it.  I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker!  At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose.  Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait...  Tada!\nChildren: Boo!\nSquidward: Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter!  Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now.  I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying...  ...flying.  Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground!  A guy stomping on the piece of paper  I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a...\nPatrick: ...a worthless piece of paper.  Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward.  Nice shirt, SpongeBob.\nSquidward: Does anybody have any sunscreen?\n","17a\nArrgh!\nMr. Krabs: Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!\nSpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!\nMr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! Hah!  Mine, mine! Huh?!\nSpongeBob: Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.\nMr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the doubloons?\nSpongeBob: There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: \"The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt\".\nPatrick: Based on a real treasure map.\nSpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.\nPatrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty.\nMr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?\nSpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?\nSpongeBob: I already took care of it.\nMr. Krabs: Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.\nPatrick: My turn.  Five.  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm.  It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired!\nPatrick: But I don't even work here!\nMr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now?\nPatrick: Boy, would I?!\nMr. Krabs: You're fired!\nSpongeBob: My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.\nMr. Krabs: Shiver me timbers!\nSpongeBob: Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.\nSpongeBob: You are a real pirate. Go straight to the \"X\" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Treasure.  There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.\nFred: Rev up those fryers, \u2018cause I am sure hungry for one--  Help! Help!  My leg!\nMr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed?!  Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: Six! One, two...  I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.\nSpongeBob: I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?\nMr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta...\nMr. Krabs: That's awful, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...\nMr. Krabs: I'll roll for you, boy.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr...\nMr. Krabs: Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr...\nMr. Krabs: One, two, three...\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! I wanna go to bed! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?\nMr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.\nSpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: That\u2019s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.\nSpongeBob: Pirates?\nMr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Treasure?  We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!\nMr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.\nMr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?\nSpongeBob: Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!\nPatrick: I'm Blind Beard the Pirate.\nSpongeBob: Ow.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.\nSpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?\nMr. Krabs: Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.\nSpongeBob: Okie dokie, then.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, \"okie dokie, then.\" A pirate says, \"arrgh!\"\nSpongeBob: Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...\nMr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!\nPatrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land...\nMr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?\nSpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, captain?\nMr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?\nPatrick: Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!\nMr. Krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the \"X\"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.\nPatrick: Ooh! East? I thought you said \"weast\"!\nMr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?\nPatrick: This one, sir.\nMr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again.  9,551... 9,552...\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.\nPatrick: And hungry.\nMr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand!\nPatrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.\nMr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!\nMr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one!\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.\nPatrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.\nSpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.\nPatrick: I know.\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?\nSpongeBob: He's not here.\nPatrick: Look! The treasure map.\nSpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.\nPatrick: Yeah...\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\nPatrick: Nothing.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.\nPatrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?\nSpongeBob: No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it.\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\nPatrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?\nSpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?\nMr. Krabs: Do you think this is a problem?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?\nPatrick: We're sorry.\nMr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?\nSpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!\nPatrick: I think that.\nMr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!\nSpongeBob: Look! It's the \"X\".\nMr. Krabs: \"X\" marks the spot!\nSpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.\nMr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.\nSpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads. Heave!\nMr. Krabs: We finally found it.\nFemale Singers: The Dutchman's Treasure.\nAll: Wow!\nSpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?\nPatrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?\nMr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!\nSpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!\nSpongeBob: What about loyalty?\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.  Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all.\nFlying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?\nMr. Krabs: They did!\nFlying Dutchman: Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!\nFlying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.\nSpongeBob: Wow!\nFemale Singers: Two Gold Doubloons.\nMr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?\nFlying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.\nMr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.\nFemale Singers: Plastic!\nFlying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest.\nPatrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.\n","17b\nRock Bottom\nSpongeBob: Another funtastic day at Glove World!\nBus Driver: Ahem.\nSpongeBob: Let me get my wallet.  Wait, let me check this pocket.  No...

'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'.\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong...  ...buuuuuuuuuuus!.... ...bus!  But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.\nBus Driver: Oh, well.\nPatrick: What is this, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Rock Bottom.  It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different.\nGreen Soil: Do you...  mind...  putting me down?\nPatrick: Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know.  Maybe we should wait for one more.\nPatrick: I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule.  Boy, this place sure is creepy.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here.  SpongeBob...!\nSpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus.  Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle.  I better go wait for the next one.  C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary.  Uh-oh, shoe's untied.  Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over...  and through the hole.  My balloon!  Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again!  Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me?  Uhh, uhh, yeah, I...  No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know what time the next bus comes...  Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what.  I'm gettin' hungry.  Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to Glove World!.  Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that?  A candy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm...  I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what!  I'll only be gone a second.  Hey!  Ooh!  Come on, come on!  Hey, that was mine!  Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy.  Tartar sauce!  Fish paste!

Fourth, not bad.  Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it.\nWindow Attendant: Next.\nSpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving.  Tartar sauce!\nWindow Attendant: Next.  Next.  Next.

I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then, I am not leaving this spot!  Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light!  Ah, that's better.\nSpongeBob: This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey...  if I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.\nSpongeBob: Who's there?  Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking.  Running! Better start running! Running!  Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting!  Sitting, sitting. Bleeding.  Hey, who's there?  Okay, that's enough.  Don't come closer.  I'm warning you!  I'm a sponge!  Oh, it's only you.  Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem.  I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon...  has...  enough...  air...  thanks.  Hey, I get it, balloon travel.

What's a Texas?\nSandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.\nSpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.\nSandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later.\nSpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah!\nSandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.\nSpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.

Surf's up, Sandy!\nSandy: No, thanks.\nSpongeBob: Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing!\nSpongeBob: Look, Sandy, we caught one!\nSandy: Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.\nSpongeBob: We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!\nPatrick: Fly away, little critter!\nSpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them.

I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya.\nSandy: Huh, duh. What am I doing?

The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious. I can deny it no longer!  I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need...  SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!\nPlankton: Yes. He's the one.\nSpongeBob: I'll have one...\nMonroe: Two, please.  Thanks.\nSpongeBob: One, please.\nEel: Excuse me.\nSpongeBob: One, please.\nLou: Sorry, kid. We're all out.\nSpongeBob: Aww, barnacles.  Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?\nPlankton: Oh, hi, SpongeBob.  I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one!  I don't know what to do with the other one!\nSpongeBob: I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.\nPlankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?\nSpongeBob: Sure!\nPlankton: SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SPONGEBOB!\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\nPlankton: Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance.  You can have anything you want with a little training.\nSpongeBob: Training?\nPlankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.\nSpongeBob: Assertive, huh?\nPlankton: That's right.\nSpongeBob: Anything I want.  Sounds great!\nPlankton: Wonderful.  SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!\nSpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.\nPlankton: No, no, be assertive!\nSpongeBob: Beep Beep!\nPlankton: Not in-sertive!  SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!\nSpongeBob: But I'm a spo...\nPlankton: Don't say it!  There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?\nSpongeBob: Ice cream!\nPlankton: Listen, you! My friend's got something to say!\nEel: What, who said that?  Was it you?\nPlankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!\nSpongeBob: That's my ice cream cone!\nPlankton: Great! Now let him have it!\nSpongeBob: You can have it.\nEel: Say, thanks!\nPlankton: No!  I'll show ya how!  Hey, pencil neck!  Yeah, you. Slither over here!  Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery!\nSpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!\nPlankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!\nSpongeBob: Yeah!\nPlankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.\nPlankton: Whatever.\nSpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it!  I found something!\nScooter Like Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours?\nSpongeBob: Sure!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!\nSpongeBob: Do you want to take a hike with me?\nScooter Like Fish: Yeah.\nPlankton: Now, look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!\nSpongeBob: Hey, go check in that ditch!\nScooter Like Fish: Wow, buried treasure! Thanks!\nSpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!\nSpongeBob: Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!\nFish: But I'm wearing sandals!\nSpongeBob: Okay, never mind!  It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?\nPlankton: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.  I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.\nSpongeBob: No it's not!\nPlankton: Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.\nSpongeBob: But what about airline food?\nPlankton: What?\nSpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night!  See, I can be a stand-up guy. See?\nPlankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!\nSpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!\nPlankton: Okay, but this is your last chance!  Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?\nSpongeBob: Just watch me!  Man, this thing is sandy!\nFred: My leg!\nPlankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach!  SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?\nSpongeBob: Well, not all of me.\nHot Dog Man: Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\nPlankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!\nSpongeBob: I'll do better than that!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!\nSpongeBob: What?\nPlankton: Breaking your wind!\nLarry: Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball.\nSpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male!  Plankton?  Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!\nPlankton: Exactly.\nSpongeBob: You didn't tell me everyone would leave.\nPlankton: Oops.\nSpongeBob: Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development!  That wasn't nice!\nPlankton: Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world!\nSpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?\nPlankton: Huh? What are you doing?  Wait, SpongeBob! Stop!  Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting!\nSpongeBob: What happened?\nScooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!\nSpongeBob: No problem!\nScooter: Whoa!  Killer!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back!  Wait!\nScooter: Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!\nSpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.\nPlankton: Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting!  Need hatred.\nSpongeBob: Volleyball, anyone?  Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!\n","19a\nFools in April\nSpongeBob: Wake up, Gary.\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: We're moving today!\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst!\nSpongeBob: Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!  To me!\nSquidward: What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible.\nMr. Krabs: What'd you catch?\nSquidward: I caught sight of the calendar.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.\nSquidward: I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?\nMr. Krabs: You just missed him.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but he told us to tell you...\nSquidward: Tell me what?\nSpongeBob: He told me to tell you... April Fools.\nSquidward: Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, wait!\nSquidward: Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!\nSpongeBob: Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!\nSquidward: You do?\nSpongeBob: Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?\nSquidward: Well, as long as it's not me.\nCora: Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?\nSpongeBob: They're right here, lady!\nCora: But this is a spoon.\nSpongeBob: April Fools!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?\nNat: Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.\nSpongeBob: Hey, what's that?\nNat: Well, I didn't see anything.  Hey, where'd that other guy go?\nSpongeBob: April Fools! I'm right here!\nNat: Hey, that was pretty good.\nSquidward: What are you doing behind the counter?\nTom: Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?\nSpongeBob: Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up!  Here you go.\nTom: Thanks.  Huh?  Huh?  Ah.\nSpongeBob: April Fools!\nTom: What did you do to my drink?!\nSpongeBob: I...  I...\nTom: You what?!?!\nSpongeBob: You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one!\nTom: I guess that is pretty funny.\nSpongeBob: Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  April Fools!\nSquidward: That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about!\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up!\nSquidward: April Fools!\nSpongeBob: Whooaahh!  Whoa!

You all know I was just kidding\u2026 Right?\nMartin: Aww, man, poor kid.\nShubie: That guy has definitely got some issues to work out.\nTom: April Fools... jerk.\nSquidward: Wait, don't go!\nMan: Hey, you stink!\nSquidward: Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.  SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh\u2026 and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of\u2026 This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am...  Patrick? What are you doing here?\nPatrick: Digging.\nSquidward: Why are you wearing that hat?\nPatrick: Hmm, I don't know.\nSquidward: Where's SpongeBob?\nPatrick: He's in the house. He's impressed.\nSquidward: With what?\nPatrick: I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this!\nSpongeBob: What do you want?\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy.\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: I'm trying to say I'm  hee-haw-hee-haw!\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?\nSpongeBob: I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.\nSquidward: Doh!  SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go.\nSpongeBob: But I couldn't...\nSquidward: I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear!\nPatrick: It must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.\nTom: April Fools... jerk.\nMama Tentacles: You stink!\nSquidward: Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and...\nSpongeBob: Squidward! Is all that true?\nSquidward: Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.\nSpongeBob: Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?\nSquidward: What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.\nSpongeBob: I promise.\nSquidward: Really?\nEveryone: April Fools!\nSquidward: April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all!\nSpongeBob: What would we do without Squidward?\n","19b\nNeptune's Spatula\nSpongeBob: Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed.\nSpongeBob: Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...\nSpongeBob and Patrick: ...the golden spatula. Wow!\nSpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready!\nMiss Shell: Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is?\nPatrick: Uhh!\nSpongeBob: Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh.\nMiss Shell: Holy smokes!\nPatrick: Rude. Hey, the light changed.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick...\nPatrick: Hold on, almost there.\nKing Neptune: Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.\nKing Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.  No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no...  Ah!\nSpongeBob: But, but...\nKing Neptune: A purveyor of foods.  Yes, you must be my new fry cook.\nHot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.\nKing Neptune: Then who pulled out the spatula?\nHot Dog Vendor: Uh, he did.\nKing Neptune: It is even funnier a second time!  You there, crustacean!\nLarry: Who, me?\nKing Neptune: You have the physique of Atlas!\nLarry: Thanks, I work out.\nKing Neptune: Make poses with me!\nLarry: Okay!\nLarry and King Neptune: Body slam!\nKing Neptune: You pulled the spatula from the grease!\nLarry: Nope, that was SpongeBob.\nKing Neptune: This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook?  Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate!  What? Am I expected to believe this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof?  Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.\nSpongeBob: Like?\nKing Neptune: The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.\nSpongeBob: Actually, I've got two.\nKing Neptune: Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear.  No, blue.  Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains...  His big toes are...  Uhh, he has six...\nPatrick: He is the new royal fry cook and you...\nKing Neptune: Silence!\nPatrick: Is it hot in here or what?\nSpongeBob: Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!\nKing Neptune: So, little one, you think you have what it takes to become my royal fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!\nPatrick:  Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch.\nKing Neptune: Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.\nPatrick: Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob?\nKing Neptune: Three challenges!\nPatrick: Three?   Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges!\nKing Neptune: Enough!\nPatrick: He'll settle for one.\nKing Neptune: There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!\nSpongeBob: I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.\nKing Neptune: Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him.\nPatrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!\nSpongeBob: How you feeling?\nPatrick: Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?\nKing Neptune: And now, see the fate that may lie ahead.  For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great.  Behold!  Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold!  My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!\nPatrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.\nKing Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?\nSpongeBob: I'm ready.\nKing Neptune: Very well then. To the Poseidome!\nMr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.\nSpongeBob: May the best man win.\nMr. Krabs: Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!\nSpongeBob: I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.\nPatrick: Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: \"Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds.\" Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger!\nSpongeBob: Once upon a time...\nSpongeBob: Perfect!\nKing Neptune: I win!  Loser!  Free patties for everyone!  Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious!  Ooh.\nAudience: You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!\nKing Neptune: Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better?  Give me that!  Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time!\nSpongeBob: So, uhh, what do you think?\nKing Neptune: Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Yeah!  We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis!\nSpongeBob: What's so funny?\nKing Neptune: You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?\nSpongeBob: You mean, Patrick can't come?\nKing Neptune: No, of course not.\nSpongeBob: And my friends?\nKing Neptune: Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.\nPatrick: It was nice knowing you, buddy!\nSpongeBob: I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.\nMr. Krabs: I lost me bet!\nKing Neptune: Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart...  to Atlantis!\nSpongeBob: I... I...  I don't wanna go!\nKing Neptune: It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it!  Maybe we do have a problem.\nSpongeBob: Wait, Neptune! I have another idea!\nPatrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?\nKing Neptune: The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove!  Haha!\nSpongeBob: What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?\nKing Neptune: Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic.\n","20a\nHooky\nNarrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?\nSpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine.\nMr. Krabs: They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes!  The hooks! The hooks!\nFred: How about a mint?\nMr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!\nTom: Can you make that to go?\nSquidward: You don't know how lucky you are.\nMr. Krabs: The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business...\nSquidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection.  Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.\nMr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya.\nSpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.\nSpongeBob: The hooks?\nMr. Krabs: Aye.  The hooks.  They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher  until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse...\nSpongeBob: What could be worse than that?\nMr. Krabs: Gift shops.\nSpongeBob: Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.\nPatrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.\nPatrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go.\nSpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.\nPatrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break.  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni...  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town.  I'm gonna be first in line for everything!\nSpongeBob: Where is everybody?\nPatrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier.\nSpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!\nPatrick: Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!\nSpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!\nPatrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs said...\nPatrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something.  Does this look dangerous?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, don't!\nPatrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel...\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend.  Patrick, you're alive.\nPatrick: Am I ever. You should try it.\nSpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?\nPatrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.\nPatrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey?\nSpongeBob: Well, no.\nPatrick: Wheeee.\nSpongeBob: I guess he didn't.\nPatrick: Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away!\nSpongeBob: Ready?\nPatrick: Ready.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Geronimo!\nSpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab.\nIvy: P.U.,  you call this food?!\nHarold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!\nAnother Harold: My sandwich IS a fried boot!\nFred: Hurry it up, will ya? We're hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it.\nSquidward: Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!\nMr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?\nSquidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break.  What?\nMr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59.  Now, what were you saying?\nSquidward: He took a break.\nMr. Krabs: Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues.  Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.\nSquidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help!\nMr. Krabs: They should be right here.\nPatrick: Again?\nSpongeBob: Again!\nMr. Krabs: The hooks! No! No! No!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: 1, 2, 3...\nMr. Krabs : Wait! Wait!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: ...blastoff.\nMr. Krabs: Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone!  If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd...  ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!\nSpongeBob: I...I...I...\nPatrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.\nMr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?\nSpongeBob: Gift shop?\nMr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna.  With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: We promise, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.\nMr. Krabs: Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck.\nMr. Krabs: Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way.\nSpongeBob: I always go to work this way.\nPatrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!\nSpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.\nPatrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.\nSpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.\nPatrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.\nSpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...\nPatrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?\nSpongeBob: Umm...\nPatrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun.  Come on, SpongeBob. You know you want to!\nSpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew! Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm...hooked! And that means...  Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!\nMr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.\nPearl: Thanks, dad.\nMr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?\nSpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?\nMr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?\nSpongeBob: Umm...no.  I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.\nMr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?\nSpongeBob: Of course not.  I mean, not exactly.  I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it!  Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked!\nMr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.\nSpongeBob: What am I gonna do?\nMr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy.\nSpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls.  D\u2019oh, okay. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off.  There.\nMr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?\nSpongeBob: Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!\nMr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob.  But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs!

SpongeBob SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: Whahoo!  Oh, I wonder when my  prize will...  get here...  My prize!  Can it be? It is.  The conch signal.  From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

Ooh!\nBarnacle Boy: Uh, Mermaid Man?\nMermaid Man: Yes, Barnacle Boy?\nBarnacle Boy: We're not in the Invisible Boatmobile, are we?\nMermaid Man: Uh, Nope.\nBarnacle Boy: I told you making the boatmobile invisible was a stupid idea.\nMermaid Man: Boatmobile!

I'll destroy it when I get back to the  , uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...\nMermaid Man: Barnacle Boy,  don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow. Or the villain. Besides, I remember another  young  whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.\nBarnacle Boy: You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot.\nMermaid Man: Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility.  But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?\nBarnacle Boy: What?\nMermaid Man: To the Invisible Boatmobile!\nSpongeBob: Oh...\nSpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells,  Barnacle Boy laid an egg, The Invisible Boatmobile,  lost a wheel and...\nSpongeBob: Hey,  can I drive?\nBarnacle Boy: Drive?

Hey-hey!\nMermaid Man: Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime...  ...just like that.\nAtomic Flounder: Help!

Are you finished with those errands yet?\nSquidward: Aha!  I know you're in here.  What?  He's heading back to the Krusty Krab!  I'll beat him there!

Krab.\nSpongeBob: Uh, does that mean you're...?\nSquidward: Yes, SpongeBob. I am finished with those errands.  I guess I want to take my place back at the cash register. I really do.\nSpongeBob: Then you might wanna put these on.  Hmm... Hey, Squidward, you know what? Look!  We forgot to switch the \"Closed\" sign to \"Open\". .

Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died! The end.\nSpongeBob: That didn't help at all.  How long? How long have I been ugly, Patrick?\nPatrick: As long as I can remember.

Say it.\nSpongeBob: I can't.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you're never going to feel better unless you get this thing off your chest.\nSpongeBob: I know, Patrick.\nPatrick: Say it. Say it.\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly.\nPatrick: You're ugly and what...?\nSpongeBob: Square?\nPatrick: No. Proud.\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.\nPatrick: Good! Say it louder.\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.\nPatrick: Louder.\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud.\nPatrick: Louder!\nSpongeBob: I'm ugly and I'm proud!  I'm ugly and I'm proud! I'm ugly and I'm proud!\nSquidward: Is that what he calls it?\nSpongeBob: That felt great! I feel empowered.\nPatrick: So whaddya wanna do now?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. How about a movie?  Pardon me. Ugly sponge coming through.\nPatrick: People respect self esteem.\nSpongeBob: Hi. I am very ugly. But you should enjoy the movie anyway.  Excuse me, sir. I hope my horrible ugliness won't be a distraction to you.\nFred: Not at all, boy.  Deuueaugh!\nPatrick: Don't worry about him, SpongeBob. He's just a-  SpongeBob? SpongeBob, what's wrong?\nSpongeBob: I can't do this, Patrick! I've tried, and I've tried,  but I'm not always as confident as I look. Maybe I'd better just go back and hide.\nPatrick: What is wrong with you people?!  Afraid to look ugliness in the face?  Well, here! Look at it!  It's ugly, isn't it?!  You look at it!\nSpongeBob: Hello.\nPatrick: You look at it!\nSpongeBob: Hi.\nPatrick: Look at it!  Look at it! Look at it! Look at it! I want all of you to look at it!\nSpongeBob: They all ran away, Patrick.\nPatrick: I bet there's no line at the snack bar.  Hello...? Hello...? They must be on break.\nSpongeBob: Oh, wait, Patrick! I just remembered.  I've got some of my peanut-onion sundae we can share!\nPatrick: That looks great!  Oh, I gotta go to the restroom!  I'm out of soap, can I borrow-\nMartin: Stay back!\nPatrick: I just want some-\nMartin: Here! Here's my money!  Take it! Take it and go away!\nPatrick: My hands aren't that dirty...  Hey, you guys want to hear a bathroom joke?\nClay: You tryin' to kill us?!\nPatrick: Oh... Oh! I caught the ugly!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, is everything okay in here?  What are you doing in there, Patrick?\nPatrick: Wouldn't you like to know?\nSpongeBob: And why is that bag on your head?\nPatrick: Why? Oh, no reason. Except you gave me the ugly!  What am I gonna do? I can't go out looking like this!\nSpongeBob: Just remember what we talked about. There's power in pride.\nPatrick: That may be fine for you, but I was one of the beautiful people. Now look at me!  I'm almost as ugly as you! I always thought if I was as ugly as that guy, I don't know what I'd do.\nSpongeBob: Patrick...?\nPatrick: What's my mom gonna say?\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\nPatrick: Oh my gosh, if my sister finds out, wait, I don't have a sister, if the bank, I mean it's one thing if you have bad shoes, or even bad hair, but...\nSpongeBob: Patrick!  You're not ugly. Your breath stinks. Really bad.\nPatrick: Ahhhhhhhh, what a relief...\nSpongeBob: Arrgh, barnacles, Patrick! What did you eat?!\nPatrick: Oh, some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...\nSpongeBob: No, I mean just this morning.\nPatrick: Some roast beef, some chicken, a pizza...\nSpongeBob: What else?\nPatrick: Well, I had some of your sundae.\nSpongeBob: Sundae...  Patrick! My sundae gave us rancid breath!\nPatrick: Whatcha mean?\nSpongeBob: I mean, we're not ugly, we just stink!\nPatrick: Stink?\nBoth: We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink! We stink!\nSpongeBob: Oh, guess what, Squidward?\nBoth: We stink!  Oh yeah! We're smelly! I reek! Smell me!\n","22b\nBossy Boots\nMr. Krabs: Attention! Attention! All Krusty Krew employees, attention!  Get the anchors out of your pants and report to me office!  That will be all.  I have an important announcement to make.\nSpongeBob: Woo! Hooray!  The new spatulas are here!\nMr. Krabs: Sit down, boy! There's no new spatulers!\nSquidward: How disappointing.\nMr. Krabs: You may know me daughter Pearl. She's growing up fast.  It seems like it was just yesterday I was teaching her how to breach. Me mammalian angel. Oh...  Anyway, uh, so she's going to be working here during her summer vacation. She's got a lot of fresh ideas to bring in some hungry customers!\nPearl: Hello? Daddy?\nMr. Krabs: Thar she blows!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, do you realize what this means?\nSpongeBob: No new spatulas?\nSquidward: No! It means some bratty teenager's coming in here to tell us what to do. We can't have that! We have seniority, right?\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSquidward: So, we'll work together to protect our pathetic positions.\nSpongeBob: Okey-dokey, Squidward. And then we'll get those new spatulas!\nMr. Krabs: All right, men.  Say hello to me Pearl.\nSpongeBob: Hello, pole.\nPearl: Hi, guys.\nMr. Krabs: It makes me jolly as a roger to have you finally aboard the family business!\nPearl: Great, dad, because I have so many new ideas.\nMr. Krabs: I can smell the money already! I'll be in me office if you need me!\nSpongeBob: What's in the box?\nPearl: It's a surprise.\nSpongeBob: I like surprises.\nPearl: Great, then close your eyes.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!\nSquidward: Well, I like it so far.\nPearl: Ta-daaaaaaaaaaa...  It's the new Krusty Krew uniform. I designed it myself.\nSquidward: Okay, this is it, SpongeBob. Now tell her how you really feel about that uniform.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Squidward.  Pearl... this is the greatest uniform ever!\nSquidward: Fish paste.\nPearl: Oh, SpongeBob, you look so adorable. I could just eat you up.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Pearl, but this item's not on the menu!\nSquidward: Well, I didn't think it was possible, SpongeBob, but you look even more ridiculous than usual.\nPearl: Don't feel jealous, Uncle Squiddy. I made one for you, too.\nSquidward: Don't bother! Only a fool would wear that!\nMr. Krabs: Avast, ye shipmates! Don't these just shiver your timbers?  Get that suit on, sailor. It's already been paid for.\nSquidward: Rage. Fury. Irritation. Humiliation.\nPearl: Squidward is such a barnacle.\nSpongeBob: A stick in the sand.\nPearl: But not you, SpongeBob. You are full of style.\nSpongeBob: Me? Really?\nPearl: Totally, S.B. You ooze fashion. And I've got some completely coral concepts for this old joint, and I'm going to need someone with your kind of talent to help me.\nSpongeBob: Well, I have been trying to get Mr. Krabs to make a few changes around here.\nPearl: Why, with my girlish instincts and your um... sponginess,  we'll turn this worn-out lunch wagon into a teenage paradise.\nPearl: SpongeBob, what do you like better? The Kutie Krab or the Kooky Krab?\nSquidward: For what, dare I ask?\nPearl: The new name for our new look. I mean, \"The Krusty Krab\" has got to go. Who wants to eat at a place they think is crusty? Bleh!\nSquidward: Well, sure it's a terrible name, but this is a terrible place. Therefore, the name should be left alone. Right, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I got it! How about The Khaotic Krab?\nPearl: Hmm... how about The Kissy Krab?\nSpongeBob: The King Krab?\nPearl: The Kandy Krab!\nSpongeBob: The Kool Krab.  Or the Kowboy Krab!  The Kurly Krab.  The Kreepy Krab.  The Killer Krab!\nPearl: Aaah! No!\nSpongeBob: You're right, too scary.\nSpongeBob and Pearl: The Kuddly Krab!\nMillie: It's a shame old man Krabs sold the Krusty Krab.\nFred: That's a darn shame. Hey, lady! Do you know where we can get something to eat around here?\nSquidward: That's it! I quit!\nShelia: Finally! A cool place for teens to just, you know, hang out!\nSpongeBob: Pearl, you're a genius. All these young, hip new customers. Phooey on Squidward. He can't keep up with the times. You're a true visionary, Pearl.\nPearl: Thank you, SpongeBob. I do have 20/20 vision.\nSpongeBob: Well, hip people have to eat, too. Back to the grill.  The customers may be hot, but my grill is hotter.\nPearl: SpongeBob, order up!\nSpongeBob: Two... sa-lads. Never heard of it. I got to stay hip. I don't want to end up like silly old Squidward. But what in the name of Davy Jones' locker is a  sa-lad?  Here you go. Two sa-lads.\nPearl: Ew, gross. Those aren't salads. Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty and the condiments.\nSpongeBob: But that just leaves the lettuce and the tomato.\nPearl: Exactly.\nSpongeBob: All right.  Okay, no buns. That's hip.  No patties,  happenin.'  Oh, yeah, that's definitely the coolest meal I've ever saw.\nNazz: This is so cool!\nSpongeBob: Two salads.  That was awful. I hope I never have to tear apart a perfectly good Krabby Patty ever again. I don't think my heart can take it.  Where's the grill?\nPearl: Come on, SpongeBob, you're a hip guy. You know that fried foods are O-U-T, out!\nSpongeBob: Uh... right on.\nPearl: Check out this new menu I came up with.\nSpongeBob: Salad and tea. But where are the Krabby Patties?\nPearl: Silly, those aren't hip. And you won't be needing that thing anymore.  I've got something more fun for you to do anyway.\nGus: Hey, buddy, you need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention!\nSpongeBob: This is humiliating. I'm a fry cook, darn it! You can take away my spatula, but when you take away my dignity, that's when I get mad! I'm going to march right up to Mr. Krabs' office and tell him this is just too much!  Okay, SpongeBob, you can do this. Come on...  Mr. Krabs, can I talk to you?\nMr. Krabs: Come on in, me boy! Have a seat.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Don't you just love me new office? Pearly designed it for me.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, um, I think we have a problem.\nMr. Krabs: Isn't that the neatest $40 chair you ever sat in?\nSpongeBob: Sure, Mr. Krabs, but I've got some bad news.\nMr. Krabs: How about my cuddly executive buddy?  Reduces stress for only five easy payments of $9.95.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Pearl is ruining the Krusty Krab!\nMr. Krabs: What?! Why, Pearl is saving the Krusty Krab! I mean, the Kuddly Krab.  What would we do without these beautiful $20 sea unicorn wall hangers?  How could we ever survive without these $35 heart lights? How could we go on without a sea fern on every last table?!  It's hip! It's coral! It's... it's losing money!  Oh, you're right, SpongeBob. But I can't fire me pride and joy, it'll break her fragile little heart! What am I going to do?\nSpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. I'm sure there's another way.\nMr. Krabs: That's it, boy!\nSpongeBob: What's it?\nMr. Krabs: You could fire her! It's okay if she hates you.\nSpongeBob: That's not what I said, sir.\nMr. Krabs: Great then, it's all settled: you fire Pearly, I'll wait in me office.\nPearl: Totally rude, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Pearl, can I see to you in the kitchen for a second?\nPearl: Sure, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: How am I going to break it to her? I've never fired anyone before. I just got to say it. Pearl, you're fired! Okay, here it goes.\nPearl: Oh, SpongeBob!\nPearl: I can't take it anymore! Nothing I do is working!\nSpongeBob: Sure it is, Pearl. Look at all the hip, young people eating sa-lads!\nPearl: No, don't you get it?! I've been trying to get fired since day one! I was only pretending to like this place to please Daddy. This job is cutting majorly into my social life. Oh, SpongeBob, what should I do?\nSpongeBob: I got it! I can pretend to  \"fire you.\" I'll take the heat from old man Krabs later.\nPearl: Gosh, you'd really do that for me? You're a great pal, SpongeBob. How can I ever thank you?!\nSpongeBob: Stop trying to break me in half?\nPearl: Deal.  Oh, boy!\nSpongeBob: Okay, Pearl. We've got to make this convincing.  Pearl, I need to have a word with you!\nMr. Krabs: Oh no, here it goes! I don't know if I can bear to listen.\nSpongeBob: It's not that you haven't done a good job around here, it's just that...\nMr. Krabs: Don't be too hard on her, now. Why does it have to be this way?  It's for the best.\nSpongeBob: Well, we feel it might be in everybody's best interest if...\nMr. Krabs: I can't let him do this!  Get on with it, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Pearl, you're fired.\nPearl: Thanks, SpongeBob.  Come on, gang, the mall awaits!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I did it!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Pearly...  Is that a $20?  Oh, SpongeBob, how could I have done such a thing to me own flesh and blood?\nSpongeBob: There, there, Mr. Krabs. Pearl took it just fine, in fact, she seemed sort of happy.\nMr. Krabs: Really?\nSpongeBob: She's off to bigger and better things.\nMr. Krabs: That's me old girl; tough as nails, just like her old man!  But how am I gonna get my money back for all this stuff?\nSpongeBob: Isn't this great, Gary? And it only cost me one year's salary!\nGary: Meow?\n","23a\nBig Pink Loser\nNarrator: Welcome to Bikini Bottom, where can be found some of the finest specimens of undersea life.  Well, you know.\nPatrick: An award? I never got an award before! Eeeee! Look rock, I got an award.  Jellyfish, I got an award.  Island, I got an awar...

What's it for?\nPatrick: See for yourself.\nSpongeBob: \"For Outstanding Achievement In Achievement: SpongeBob SquarePants?\"\nPatrick: SpongeBob SquarePants? That's a funny way to spell my name.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I think the award is for me. You must've got it by mistake.\nPatrick: But, it's shiny.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but you know what else is shiny?\nPatrick: Ice cream!\nSpongeBob: Exactly!\nPatrick: I can find it. Is it in here?\nSpongeBob: No, don't! That's my...  ...award closet.\nPatrick: I want an award.\nSpongeBob: Aww, Patrick, don't cry.\nSpongeBob: You'll get an award one day.\nPatrick: I'm never gonna get an award 'cause I've never done anything.\nSpongeBob: But you're Patrick...  Star. You can do anything you want.\nPatrick: That's easy for you to say. You're SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, if you wanna win an award, you have to do something.\nPatrick: Hmmm...I wanna defeat the giant monkeyman and save the 9th dimension!\nSpongeBob: Me too! But that sounds a little hard. Why don't we start smaller?\nPatrick: I wanna defeat the little monkeyman and save the 8th dimension!\nSpongeBob: Smaller.\nPatrick: Doctor?\nSpongeBob: Smaller.\nPatrick: Fireman?\nSpongeBob: The smallest you can think of.\nPatrick: A job at the Krusty Krab?\nSpongeBob: Yeah!  I do things at work all the time.\nPatrick: Then let's go.\nPatrick: Boy, it sure was nice of Mr. Krabs to give me a job.\nSpongeBob: And at 50 dollars an hour, too. When I started working here, I had to pay Mr. Krabs 100 dollars an hour. Hey, Squidward, guess who just got a job?\nSquidward: Guess who just quit?\nPatrick: Do I get my award yet?\nSpongeBob: You have to work for it, remember?\nPatrick: Tartar sauce.\nSpongeBob: Pick up order!\nPatrick: Do I get my award, now?\nSpongeBob: No, you have to take the tray to the customer.\nPatrick: Ok.\nSpongeBob: Almost. Try again and this time make sure the food gets to the table.\nPatrick: Like that?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nPatrick: Barnacles!\nSpongeBob: Let's try something different.\nSpongeBob: All you have to do is answer the phone.\nPatrick: Aye aye, Captain!\nGuy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?\nPatrick: No, this is Patrick.\nGirl on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?\nPatrick: No! This is Patrick!\nAnother Guy on Phone: Is this the Krusty Krab?\nPatrick: No! This is Patrick!  I'm not a Krusty Krab.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.\nPatrick: Huh? Oh, Fishpaste!\nSpongeBob: It looks a little dusty around Table 3. How about you sweep it out?\nPatrick: What's the point? I can't do anything right.\nSpongeBob: You'll do fine.\nNat: Hey pal. You just blow in from Stupidtown?\nSpongeBob: Keep trying, Patrick.\nDelivery Guy: I've got a load of awards for SpongeBob SquarePants.\nPatrick: Why can't I do anything right?!\nSpongeBob: Kitchen!\nPatrick: I'm never gonna get an award, now.\nSpongeBob: Don't give up, Patrick. This time I've got something I know you can do. We're gonna open a jar.  Easy. Now you try. First get a jar.  Patrick, that's a pickle.\nPatrick: Yes.\nSpongeBob: You need a jar.  No.  No.  No. Try...this!  Now take the lid off the jar.  Just relax. Lift your hand.  Great! We're almost there. Now put it on the lid.  No, the lid.   Freeze!  Almost there. Now head for the lid.  Cold.  Warmer.  Warmer.  Warmer. You're hot. You're on fire!\nPatrick: Ow, it burns!\nSpongeBob: Ok, ok. Wait, wait. Do exactly as I do.  Exactly as I do.  Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.\nPatrick: Exactly as you do.  Oh, no, I broke it!\nSpongeBob: No, no, Patrick, you did it!\nPatrick: I did?  Touchdown! I'm jarmaster!\nSpongeBob: That was great, Patrick! You really got the hang of it.\nPatrick: Yeah. Remember when I had my hand up? And I put it on the lid?\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah.\nPatrick: Then I took the lid off and I thought I broke it?\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\nPatrick: But I didn't. I opened the jar with my hand. And it was all because you showed me how to do it. I'm never gonna forget this.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you do exactly what I do and you'll have an award in no time.  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.\nPatrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Wow. It's amazing how a simple change of clothes can make a guy look...just...like...me.\nPatrick: Yup. If I'm gonna be an award winner, I've gotta dress like one.\nSpongeBob: That's creepy...but flattering! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...  Huh?\nSpongeBob: Well, back to the ol' grind.\nPatrick: Well, back to the ol' grind.\nSpongeBob: Forget my hat.\nPatrick: Uh, me, too.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Whew!\nSpongeBob: Dropped my spatula.\nPatrick: Uhh, me, too.  Ow!\nSpongeBob: Aha!  You're copying me!\nPatrick: Yes.\nSpongeBob: Why are you doing that?\nPatrick: So I can win an award like you.\nSpongeBob: Well, it's annoying, so stop it!\nPatrick: Stop it.\nSpongeBob: Say, you're good.\nPatrick: Thanks.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Ha! Darn.  Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as...pickled fish lips!  Sea weavle. Gorgy smorgy.\nSpongeBob: At least I'm safe inside my mind.\nPatrick: At least I'm safe inside my mind.\nSpongeBob: Stop copying me!\nPatrick: There's no award for that!\nSquidward: Well, I guess it's safe to go in now.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, how long are you gonna keep this up?\nPatrick: Until I have as many awards as you.\nSpongeBob: We'll see about that!\nPatrick: No, we won't.\nSpongeBob: I'm the jump-rope champion of Bikini Bottom.\nPatrick: Me, too.\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah? I call this one: The Slice N' Dice.  Ha! Not a scratch on me.\nPatrick: Oh, no, you don't!\nSpongeBob: Not much fun being me, now, huh, Patrick?\nPatrick: Are you kidding? I used to do this way before I started copying you.\nPatrick: My turn!\nSpongeBob: I wish I had the old Patrick back, but he just wants to be like me.  Hi, I'm Patrick Star. I'm the laziest, pinkest starfish in Bikini Bottom and I wish I were me and not SpongeBob.\nPatrick: What's so great about being a big pink loser?  Exactly. I was never closer to an award then the minute I started copying you.\nSpongeBob: But, Patrick...\nPatrick: Patrick's not here!\nDelivery Guy: Trophy delivery!\nSpongeBob: Another trophy?\nPatrick: Oh, great!  What's it for THIS time?\nSpongeBob: 'For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anyone Else'.\nSpongeBob: Patrick! This trophy's for you!\nPatrick: Yay!  Eee!\nSpongeBob: So, what are you gonna do, now?\nPatrick: I'm gonna go protect my title.\nNarrator: So you thought I was kidding, huh?

Everyone's money is good here.  At the Krusty Krab, we serves all kinds.\nSquidward: I'm not taking an order for a bubble.\nMr. Krabs: Sure you are! Or I'll fill your life with misery and woe.

Huh, what's that? Bubble Buddy says it tastes funny. What do you think?\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Think of the customer.\nSquidward: Oh, silly me. I got the diet shampoo. Here we go, one of everything for Bubble Buddy.\nSpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, wait!

How about you take these patties and sh...\nMr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Bubble Buddy. Squidward will make a fresh batch.\nSquidward: What, is he allergic to bread, too?\nSpongeBob: Actually he doesn't like the crust. And Squidward, the ketchup should be under the patty. And Squidward, the pickles should be on the left side. And Squidward, you should... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward... And Squidward...\nSquidward: Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes carnival-style!

You see, Squidward, the restaurant game is all about service. The customer is always right. Remember that, lad, and you'll be as successful as me one day.\nSquidward: Oh, you're right, Mr. Krabs.

Things are getting a little weird around here.\nSpongeBob: So long.\nBubble Buddy: Happy Leif Ericcson Day!\nSquidward: He's alive?\nSpongeBob: Of course! Otherwise he couldn't tell such funny jokes!  Seems like only this morning I held his bottle.  They blow up so fast.\nSquidward: Uh...hi?\n","24a\nDying for Pie\nSpongeBob: Order up, Squidward!\nSpongeBob: Hey, hey Squidward, did you see me?  Okay, see you later, Squidinator.\nMr. Krabs: Good morning, Mr. Squidward.  So, are you ready?\nSquidward: To go home?\nMr. Krabs: No, to exchange gifts for Employee Brotherhood Day.\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, you pay me to stand behind this register and take orders and give change. But you could never pay me enough to act brotherly towards...  ...that guy!\nMr. Krabs: That attitude of yours is precisely why we're having this little shenanigan. Now pay attention, the lad's got a surprise for ye.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, in honor of employee brotherhood, I present to you a gift.  Ta-dah.\nSquidward: \"I Heart you...\"\nMr. Krabs: Try it on, Mr. Squidward! It's got you written all over it.\nSpongeBob: I wasn't sure how big to make the hole for the head, so I used a watermelon for size.  Do you love it?\nSquidward: It's a little itchy. What's this thing made of?\nSpongeBob: Eyelashes!\nSquidward: Now may I resume to my minimum-wage duties?\nMr. Krabs: After you present your brotherhood gift.\nSquidward: I'll buy the little twerp a gum ball.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, no, lad. You know the rules; you have to make the gift.\nSquidward: The only thing I'm making is for the exit.\nSpongeBob: Is this any better, Squidward? I made this one with my tears.\nMr. Krabs: I knew you'd come around, boy. Make something nice.\nSquidward: Why can't I just buy something for the little weirdo?\nCaptain: Heave-ho!  If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!\nSquidward: Hi, there. Those homemade pies sure look good.\nPirate: Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.\nSquidward: Oh, well, that's too bad. I thought they were pies and I wanted to buy one.\nCaptain: Wait!  We were just kidding about all that bomb stuff. That'll be 25 bucks, please.\nSquidward: So, what flavor is it?\nPirates: Cherry. Apple. Raspberry.\nSquidward: Well, if it'll get old man Mr. Krabs off my back.  Okay, here it is, Mr. Krabs, fresh from the oven. I'll be returning to my life now.\nMr. Krabs: Not yet. I got to make sure you did it right.  Wait a second... this would go great with some milk!  So, you tried to kill me over a little new age management, eh?\nSquidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I had no idea. I can explain!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, are you okay? I heard a... wow! A pie!  It's from Squidward.  \"To SpongeBob... Well, here you go.\"\nSquidward: And that's what happened!\nMr. Krabs: 25 dollars?! A bomb?!\nSquidward & Mr. Krabs: IN THE KRUSTY KRAB?!\nMr. Krabs: That's where you left it.\nSquidward: It's not there.\nSpongeBob: Hey guys.  Thanks for the pie, Squidward.  La, la, lalalalalala.\nMr. Krabs: You had to kill him. The boy cries you a sweater of tears... and you kill him. How are you gonna live with yourself?\nSquidward: Kill him?\nSpongeBob: Here's your order, sir.\nCustomer: Thanks.\nSquidward: No, no! What we got... we got to call the hospital!\nMr. Krabs: Won't do any good. I've seen this before. When that pie goes up to bat, I mean, hits his lower intestine... boom!\nSquidward: You've seen this before?\nMr. Krabs: Eleven times as a matter of fact.\nSquidward: Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times?  Oh, he's a goner. How do we tell him?\nMr. Krabs: Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours.\nSquidward: You're right, Mr. Krabs!  I'm gonna make SpongeBob's final hours the best he's ever had. And this time, there's going to be love... so much, he's going to drown in it.  Drown in it!\nMr. Krabs: Note to self: Watch out for Squidward.\nSquidward: Uh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes?\nSquidward: I forgot to tell you, there's a part two to your gift.\nSpongeBob: Part two?  Part two, part two, part two, part two...\nSquidward: Please, don't do that.\nSpongeBob: What's the part two?\nSquidward: Well, what's the most fun thing you can think of?\nSpongeBob: Actually, I keep a list of the fun things I like to do. I call it my friendship list.\nSquidward: Great. Uh, let me see it.\nSpongeBob: The things that are extra fun, I've written in red.\nSquidward: Everything's in red.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I know.\nSquidward: We'd better start now if we want to get through this list before you die... of anticipation.\nSpongeBob: Then let's roll!  Bye, Mr. Krabs.  Heads up, Squidward\u2014looks like they're gonna replace you.\nSquidward: Uh, yeah. Let's take a look at that list.\nSpongeBob: Well, the first thing I want to do is show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town.  Hi, there, this is my best friend, Squidward.  Hey, kids, check it out! This is my best friend, Squidward.  Hi, I want to show you my best friend, Squidward.\nSquidward: Hey, Frank.  Glad that's over.\nSpongeBob: Good, 'cause we're onto our next activity.\nSquidward: Which is...?\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town wearing a salmon suit.\nSquidward: You're gonna be wearing a salmon suit?\nSpongeBob: That's a good one Squidward!  Next.  Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.\nSquidward: Who's there?\nSpongeBob: I am!\nSquidward: Oh, yeah...\nSpongeBob: Look out, everyone, friends in reverse!\nSpongeBob: Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.\nSquidward: I can't breathe.\nSquidward: Are you sure you should be poking it like that?\nSpongeBob: Who's the doctor here?  The last thing on the list is...\nSquidward: Does it involve more dismemberment?\nSpongeBob: Watch the sunset with Squidward.\nSquidward: Sunset?\nMr. Krabs: The way I see it, the lad's got until sunset before that bomb hits his lower intestine.\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's Mr. Krabs! Hi, Mr. Krabs.  Okay, see you later.\nSquidward: C'mon buddy, you want a sunset, you'll get a sunset.\nSpongeBob: Ah, underwater sunsets sure are beautiful. Eh, Squidward?\nSquidward: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, this is great, just the three of us. You, me,  ...and this brick wall that you built between us.\nSquidward: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward?\nSquidward: Explosions... I mean, erosion.\nSpongeBob: You know, if I were to die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to the carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay.  Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine.  Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry?  Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five... You do the rest, buddy.\nSquidward: Four... three... two... one...\nSpongeBob: I guess we started too early. Let's start again.\nSquidward: Five... four... three...  two...  o-o-o-one... Well, at least I was able to make his last few hours meaningful.  I am such a good person.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out!  Squidward, we already played babble like an idiot.\nSquidward: Why are you still here?!\nSpongeBob: Well, since we finished everything on the list, I thought I'd make up a new one.  I already filled up this book of ideas. We should be able to finish by January.\nSquidward: Forget the book! I spent the whole day with you, doing all kinds of ridiculous things, because you were supposed to explode!\nSpongeBob: You want me to explode?\nSquidward: Yes! That's what I've been waiting for!\nSpongeBob: Um, okay, I'll try.  Gary! You are gonna finish your dessert, and you are gonna like it!  Now it's your turn!\nSquidward: That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!\nSpongeBob: Oh, good one.\nSquidward: No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!\nSpongeBob: Why would I do that?\nSquidward: Because the pie you ate was a bomb!\nSpongeBob: What pie?\nSquidward: The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!\nSpongeBob: Pie...pie...  Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat!  Oops!\nSquidward: Ouch.\n","24b\nImitation Krabs\nNarrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the Krabby Patty, with its top secret formula, known only to those who are brave enough and intelligent enough to comprehend its culinary complexity.\nSpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs. I'm doing it, I'm doing it!\nMr. Krabs: Quit fooling around, SpongeBob, we got customers.\nNarrator: But wherever there's a secret recipe, there is someone who wants to steal it.\nPlankton: Ouch!  And now for the final touch.  Perfect! With this disguise, that formula is as good as mine.\nFish Robot: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?\nSpongeBob: Why, yes. Yes I am.\nFish Robot: Then you've just won one million dollars!  You just have to answer one question. What is the Krabby Patty secret formula?  Yes?  Yes?  Yes?!\nSpongeBob: The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary.\nPlankton: That's it?!  You'd better cough up that secret formula or else!\nMr. Krabs: Plankton!\nPlankton: Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Plankton!\nPlankton: Krabs!\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob.\nPlankton: You can't do this to me, Krabs!  I went to college!  Ouch.\nMr. Krabs: That Plankton is a clever beast. You've got to keep a sharp eye out for him, SpongeBob. The Krabby Patty law must be enforced. The future of the Krusty Krab depends on it.\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, as long as these pants are square,  and this sponge is Bob,  I will not let you down!\nMr. Krabs: Uh, SpongeBob?  Could you let me down?\nFish: Man, these patties sure are delicious. I wonder what's in that secret formula.\nSpongeBob: Code twelve, code twelve!  Your disguises can't fool me this time, Plankton!\nFish: Everyone at the head enhancement clinic said nobody would notice!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're scaring away me money!\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was just trying to protect the secret formula.\nMr. Krabs: That's no reason to rip other people's heads off, boy. Just remember the most important rule.\nSpongeBob: No free napkins?\nMr. Krabs: No! the other most important rule. Regarding the secret formula.\nSpongeBob: Only discuss the formula with Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: As long as you do that, the secret is safe.\nSquidward: I always thought the most important rule was \"why do today what you can put off till tomorrow?\"\nMr. Krabs: What is today, but yesterday's tomorrow?\nSquidward: Huh?\nMr. Krabs: Today, I want you to take inventory on everything in here; every last pickle and patty must be accounted for.\nSquidward: Aye aye, captain.  Two boxes of buns. Three pounds of patties.\nImitation Krabs: Mr. Squidward...\nSquidward: What now, Mr. Krabs?\nImitation Krabs: That's right, I am Krabs.\nPlankton: Your boss, your ruler, your master!\nImitation Krabs: Ha, ha, ha.\nSquidward: You're not Mr. Krabs.\nImitation Krabs: Hey, why don't you take the rest of the day off?\nSquidward: Well... whatever you say, \"Mr. Krabs.\"  Whoopee!\nSpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.\nPlankton: Oh, sweet domination. This is it!\nSpongeBob: No sign of Plankton, yet. Gosh, Mr. Krabs. You don't look so good.  Ooh, you're so cold.\nImitation Krabs: That's just my metal suit. I made it to protect the formula.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!\nPlankton: It's that thick-headed Krabs. He'll ruin everything.\nImitation Krabs: Look, a jellyfish.\nSpongeBob: I got it, I got it. I got it, I got it\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, what happened to your metal pants?\nMr. Krabs: Don't get all loopy on me, boy. I need your help. And where in the high seas is Squidward?\nSpongeBob: You gave him the day off.\nMr. Krabs: Day...  ...oooooooooff?!  I don't know the meaning of them horrible words!  Now quit your laying around, SpongeBob, and take out that garbage! It's starting to give me a rash.\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir, Mr. Krabs, sir!  Hey, Mr. Krabs, just taking out that garbage.\nImitation Krabs: Never mind that. I need to talk to you.\nSpongeBob: Whoa-ho, Mr. Krabs. I didn't know you had heat vision.\nImitation Krabs: Never mind. I need you to tell me...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nImitation Krabs: Yoinks!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm not paying you to stand around.  Get back to the kitchen!\nSpongeBob: But I thought you wanted to ask me a question.\nMr. Krabs: Yes... why aren't you working harder?\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Mr. Krabs... I don't know.\nPlankton: I'll never get that formula with that pest Krabs popping in and out like that. I've got it! I've been saving this for a rainy day.  It looks like an ordinary penny... because it is an ordinary penny. That fool Krabs is too greedy to ignore you, my little pretty.\nMr. Krabs: That sound, it sounds like... the pitter-patter of...  money!  Hey, where you going, beautiful?\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs...  Wha...\nMr. Krabs: Stop! Please!  Wait!\nImitation Krabs: Nothing stands between me and that secret formula now.  Ouch!\nSpongeBob: Scrub-a-dub-dub, I love to rub.  Hey, Mr. Krabs, just doing a little scrubbin'.\nImitation Krabs: Hello, SpongeBob, it is me, Mr. Krabs.  In the flesh.  Standing right in front of you.  With no one else around.\nSpongeBob: I can see that, Mr. Krabs.\nImitation Krabs: I thought we might discuss the Krabby Patty secret formula.\nSpongeBob: Isn't that a microphone?\nImitation Krabs: What? Why, yes it is.  I must get this shirt cleaned. Alright, now tell me the secret formula.\nSpongeBob: But, sir, we haven't done the secret handshake yet.\nImitation Krabs: Oh yes. Here, let's shake.\nSpongeBob: We don't shake with our hands, remember?\nImitation Krabs: Uh, right, why don't you start?\nSpongeBob: We stand on one foot.  Balance a glass of chocolate milk on our heads and sing the Bikini Bottom National Anthem.\nMusic: \"Bikini Bottom National Anthem\"\nOh, Bikini Bottom, we pledge our hearts to you, As faithful, as deep, as true, as blue, Bikini Bottom, we love you!\nImitation Krabs: Formula time?\nSpongeBob: Almost.\nNarrator: Six and a half hours later...\nImitation Krabs: Yum yum, this spaghetti sure is good.

I even ate 105 black licorice jellybeans through a straw!\nImitation Krabs: Now why can't you tell me the formula?\nSpongeBob: It's your rule. Never speak the formula. You told me to keep it in...this bottle.\nPlankton: This is it, Plankton. Gently, now...\nImitation Krabs: Gasp!\nMr. Krabs: How could you do this, SpongeBob? Giving me secret formula to this imposter?!\nImitation Krabs: Don't listen to him, SpongeBob. Remember: Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no! Don't listen to him. I'm the real Mr. Krabs.\nImitation Krabs: Don't listen to him. He's obviously a robot.\nMr. Krabs: Well, if I was a robot, which I'm not, at least I'm well put together. Not some rusted-out, steam-driven piece of junk!\nImitation Krabs: Who are you calling steam-driven...?\nSpongeBob: Quiet!  Until I know who the real Mr. Krabs is, nobody moves,  nobody gets hurt.\nMr. Krabs and Imitation Krabs: Tartar sauce?!\nMr. Krabs: Take it easy with that thing, son.\nSpongeBob: I'll do the talking around here. I think I'll just ask you two a couple of questions. Questions only the real Mr. Krabs could answer.\nMr. Krabs: Okay, then.\nSpongeBob: First question: What time does the Krusty Krab open?\nImitation Krabs: 9:30 A.M.\nSpongeBob: Right.  That's one strike, Mr. Fake.\nMr. Krabs: But...\nSpongeBob: Nuh-uh-uh! I'm running this quiz show, I'll ask the questions. If there's gonna be any 'buts,' they're gonna be from me. Okay, question number two: How much does a Krabby Patty cost?\nMr. Krabs: $2.99!\nSpongeBob: On Wednesday...\nImitation Krabs: 99\xa2!\nSpongeBob: Right again!  You're starting to look pretty phony right about now. I'd be nervous if I were you. Now only the really real Mr. Krabs could answer this \u2014 If we're discussing the secret formula on the third Wednesday in January and it's not raining outside after we've gargled with vanilla pudding, what do we do?\nMr. Krabs: That's an easy one. You just...just... let's see... if its..uh.. if it's January... with...with vanilla pudding...you...uh...pass?  Wait, SpongeBob! Give me another chance!  No!\nSpongeBob: So long, Imitation Krabs! Buh-bye!  I knew it was you all along, Mr. Krabs, here you go.\nImitation Krabs: Thank you, SpongeDupe.\nSpongeBob: Oop! Don't forget your lucky penny.\nImitation Krabs: Yoinks.\nSpongeBob: This must be your lucky day.\nKaren: The self-destruct coin slot has been activated. Ten seconds 'til detonation.\nPlankton: Coin-operated self-destruct? Not one of my better ideas. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeelp!  Ouch!\nSpongeBob: If that was Plankton... Uh-oh!\nMr. Krabs: Help! Get Away! No!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nHans: Mmm\u2026yum-yum.\nMr. Krabs: Back, you hungry hand, back! Help!\nSpongeBob: Gee, Mr. Krabs. I'm sorry. I thought you were a phony.\nMr. Krabs: Phew, that's okay, me lad. Long as the secret formula's safe again.

I gotta draw a new battery for this.\nSpongeBob: What if Mr. Krabs was right? Maybe my idea is dumb.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, sometimes, we have to go deep inside ourselves to solve our problems.\nSpongeBob: I'm scared.\nPatrick: Then I'm going in for you!\nPatrick: Sorry. Stupid inflatable pants!\nSpongeBob: Did you find anything?\nPatrick: Huh?\nHarold: Hey, do you sell food here?\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir! We sell Pretty Patties!\nHarold: That thing's green!

Let's take a listen.\nAll: Pretty Patties! Pretty Patties!\nMr. Krabs: Pretty Patties?\nJohnny: It's easy to see Pretty Patties are popular, but what is it about them that drives Bikini Bottom feeders wild?\nMillie, Sadie , and Evelyn: They match our purses!\nScottish Man: They remind me of home.\nLarry: Pretty Patties rule!\nJohnny: Mr. SquarePants, how do you explain all this success?\nSpongeBob: Uhhh... I don't know.\nMr. Krabs: How can you make money with such a stupid idea?\nJohnny: And how can you not make money with such a brilliant idea?\nSpongeBob: At first we didn't know what to do with all the money. We tried burying it...  ...shredding it...  ...and burning it.  But in the end, we decided just to give it all away.\nPatrick: Come again, sir!\nNathiel: I'm getting back in line!\nMr. Krabs: I don't believe it!  I've got to see this for me self!\nSandals: Hey Watch it, buddy. I don't care how much you want your Pretty Patty.

I guess you've completely forgotten the Krusty Krab.\nSpongeBob: No, sir, I haven't. Sometimes I really miss the old days back at the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs: I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest.\nSpongeBob: Yeah. Yeah! But do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs?  That tiny squeaking sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Uhh... Yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab's only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down. For old time's sake.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I can't leave, Mr. Krabs. What about the stand?\nMr. Krabs: Don't worry, lad. I'll watch the stand for ye.\nSpongeBob: You will?\nMr. Krabs: No! I've got a better idea. I'll take this old roadside stand off your hands. For keeps. An in exchange, I'll give you the Krusty Krab.

Aw, what am I waiting for?  Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!\nGrandma: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hi, Grandma!\nGrandma: Come in and sit for a while.  Have a cookie, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Grandma, you make the best cookies in the deep blue sea.  Oh yeah...  Grandma's cookies...\nGrandma: Now, who wants to lick the spoon?\nSpongeBob: Me, me, me!\nGrandma: ...and then we drove all the way home with all the windows down in the freezing cold.\nSpongeBob: Tell me another story about when I was a baby.  Three o'clock? I'm gonna be late for work!\nGrandma: Hop in my car, I'll drop you off.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Grandma!\nGrandma: SpongeBob, you forgot your kissy-kissy!\nSpongeBob: I sure did.  Bye, Grandma, thanks for the ride.  Thank you, Squidward.  Isn't this great? Everybody's in a good mood today.\nSquidward: I love bursting your bubble, SpongeBob, but they're laughing at you, not with you.\nSpongeBob: Did I do something funny?\nSquidward: Your forehead.\nSpongeBob: My forehead is funny?\nCharlie: Hey, hey, Grandma's boy? Kissy-kissy-kissy!\nSpongeBob: No, you're wrong! There's nothing wrong with getting kisses from your grandma.\nCharlie: No, especially if you're a big baby who wears diapers!  And sucks his thumb, and plays with dolls, and, um...  ...wears pajamas with feet in 'em, and carries his, um... blankie around, and...\nCustomers: All right already!\nSquidward: Cheer up, SpongeBob. I know someone who still likes you.\nSpongeBob: Really? You do, Squidward?\nSquidward: Yeah, your grandma!\nSpongeBob: Stop it...!  I have been publicly humiliated for the last time!\nPatrick: I'm sorry that happened to you, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Me, too.\nPatrick: You're the most adult person I know.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick.\nPatrick: You know how grandmas are, they love babies. You just can't act like a baby around her.\nSpongeBob: You're right, Patrick.\nPatrick: Have I ever not been right?  You're a man now, SpongeBob, and it's time you starting acting like one.\nSpongeBob: Yeah! Oh, but I'm not sure I know how.\nPatrick: Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest.  Now say \"tax exemption.\"\nSpongeBob: Tax exemption.\nPatrick: Now, you must acquire a taste for free-form jazz.  Okay, SpongeBob, you're ready!  This is it. What are you going to tell Grandma?\nSpongeBob: I'm a grownup.\nPatrick: No ifs, ands, or buts about it.\nSpongeBob: A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.\nPatrick: And then you get behind her and I'll push.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, we didn't say that.\nPatrick: Oh yeah, right.\nSpongeBob: All we need now is the icing on the maturity cake.  I've been growing these babies for years.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Sideburns.\nGrandma: Oh, hello, SpongeBob. What a nice surprise. Come here and give your Granny her kissy-kissy.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, grandmother, but the kissing has to stop.\nPatrick: Tell her like it is, SpongeBob, no more baby stuff.\nSpongeBob: He is right, Grandmother. Kisses are for babies, which I am no longer. I have grown up. It is nature's way.\nGrandma: Oh, you are absolutely right.\nSpongeBob: I am? I mean, of course I am.\nGrandma: You will definitely not be treated like a baby around here anymore ever again.\nSpongeBob: I am glad you see it my way, grandmother.\nGrandma: Well, I'm glad that's settled.  But what am I going to do with all these fresh baked cookies?\nSpongeBob: Sorry, grandmother, we adults don't partake in the consumption of sweets, right, Pat...  ...rick?\nPatrick: Keep 'em coming, Granny!\nSpongeBob: So much for no more baby stuff.\nGrandma: And don't forget the cookie-eating hat!\nSpongeBob: Hey, that's my cookie-eating hat! I mean it was when I was a baby.\nGrandma: Well, look who's here. It's my big old adult grandson.\nSpongeBob: Grandmother, I need to have a mature conversation with Mr. Patrick.   Patrick! What are you doing?! Cookies?! Warm milk?! A bib?!  Is that a kissy mark on your forehead?! We are supposed to be adults!\nGrandma: Oh, oh, no roughhousing with a full tummy.  Who's the baby?\nPatrick: I'm the baby, I'm the baby, I'm the baby!  Being grown up is boring. I love being a baby. Besides, I don't get jazz.\nSpongeBob: Poor Patrick. I almost feel sorry for you.  Trapped in the awkward phase of diaper days... never to know the rich rewards of being a grownup.\nGrandma: Here's a fresh batch of cookies.\nPatrick: All right!  Rewards, huh?\nSpongeBob: Well, yeah, there's, eh...  well, let's see, we...  We went over the jazz...\nPatrick: Oh, Grandma, I'm full.\nGrandma: More cookies!\nSpongeBob: It appears to be my lunch hour. Grownups have to eat to. I guess this will have to do.\nGrandma: Oh, you don't want this baby food. How about a big piece of steamed coral?\nSpongeBob: Oh yeah, uh... great.  Nutritious.\nGrandma: Storytime!\nPatrick: Oh, boy! Storytime, storytime, storytime!\nSpongeBob: Storytime?\nGrandma: You'll enjoy this, Patrick. It's a wonderful story about a magical sea leprechaun.  Oh, SpongeBob, you wouldn't be interested in this baby book.  Here's the technical manual on routine active maintenance.\nSpongeBob: Oh, uh... great. Yeah.  Fascinating. No pictures, just the way I like it.\nPatrick: D'oh! My wittle finger!\nGrandma: Hold still, hold still.  All better?\nPatrick: Sorta....  this finger hurts a little bit too.\nGrandma: How about I give you a present?\nPatrick: Oh, boy, I hope it's cookies!  Alright, another hat.\nGrandma: No, Patrick, it's a sweater.\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nGrandma: With love in every stitch.\nSpongeBob: No...  Don't I get a present, Grandma?\nGrandma: Oh, I almost forgot.  Here's some office supplies. I didn't wrap them. I knew you wouldn't mind.  Uh-oh, three o'clock, time for adults to go to work. Bye-bye, SpongeBob.\nI'll bet you'd fancy a nap, huh, Patrick?  You still here, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Uh, I don't need to leave yet. I can be late for work.\nGrandma: No, no, no, that wouldn't be the adult thing to do.\nSpongeBob: Alright, I guess I'll be going. I've, uh, got a lot of adult-type business to take care of, so, uh, I'll see yah later.\nGrandma: Okay, thanks for stopping by, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Yep, that is it. Here I go.\nGrandma: Come again if you get the chance.\nSpongeBob: Out into the cold, grown-up world alone without a sweater.\nGrandma: Toodleloo.\nSpongeBob: I don't know when I'll be back.\nGrandma: I know how busy you are.\nSpongeBob: So, uh... that's it.\nGrandma: Shh, he's asleep.\nSpongeBob: Soo long...  I don't wanna grow up!  I want cookies!  and \"milkie\"!  I want a sweater with love in the stitches!  I wanna wear \"diadies\"!  I wanna ride in my wagon!  I wanna cuddle-wuddle with Mister Stuffykins!  I wanna rocky-rock on my seahorsey!  And I want kissy-kissy on my boo-boo!\nGrandma: Take it easy, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob. SpongeBob!  You don't have to be a baby to get ol' Grandma's love.\nSpongeBob: I don't?\nGrandma: Of course not.  No matter how grown-up you get, you'll always be my little baby boo.  And remember, you can kiss your grandma and still be an adult.  Here you go.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Grandma.  Uh, Grandma, could you not mention this to the guys down at the Krusty Krab?\nGrandma: No problem.\n","26b\nSquidville\nSpongeBob: Patrick, look. I got my...  I'm sorry, Patrick.  It's just for a second I thought...\nPatrick: Hey, you got the same reef blower as me!  Tag, you're it.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you made my house sparkling clean.\nPatrick: Sure did.\nSpongeBob: We haven't improved Squidward's day yet. Let's do his house!  My turn.\nSquidward: What is going on out here?\nSpongeBob: We're playing with our new reef blowers!\nSquidward: Playing with a reef blower? That is the most childish thing I have ever heard of.\nSpongeBob: But it's fun!\nSquidward: Fun?! How could playing with one of those over-sized hair dryers possibly be fun?\nPatrick: Like this...\nSquidward: Chafed.  Alright, that's...!\nSpongeBob: Let's do your house, Patrick.\nPatrick: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you're steaming! You're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter.\nSquidward: Put my windows back!\nSpongeBob: No problem, Squidward! We're on your side!  Any second now\u2026\nSquidward: SpongeBob, this is the final straw. I am going to move so far away, that I will be able to brag about it. I would-  I would rather tear out my brain stem, carry it into the middle of the nearest four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than go on living where I do now!\nTV Octopus: Hi there! Is this the final straw? Do you want to move so far away, that you can brag about it? Would you rather tear out your brain stem, walk out into the middle of the nearest three-way-\nSquidward: Four-way!\nTV Octopus: Four-way intersection, and skip rope with it, than continue living where you do now? Then move to-\nPatrick: I hate this channel.\nSquidward: No! No!\nTV Octopus: -Tentacle Acres!

Yes, peace and quiet.\nGuard: Are you now, or have you ever been, a sponge?\nSquidward: No.\nGuard: What about a-\nSquidward: No, no starfish. Just a regular, normal, peace-loving-  Heaven at last.\nOther Octopus: I've seen more alert people in a retirement home!\nSquidward: Oh, which way to the Living-without-a-brain seminar? Don't be late!\nOther Octopus: I've heard better comebacks from a turkey sandwich! Get a life!\nSquidward: This place is even better than I expected!  302, 303, and 304. Beautiful.  And not a pineapple in sight.\nSquidward: Good night, Clary. Tomorrow, we begin life anew.\nSquidward: 304 New Life street, Squidward speaking.  There is no way I am moving back there, SpongeBob! I am finally among my own kind.  Now, goodbye.\nSquidward: Ahh. I think I'll take my bike today.  I'm my own man.  Now these neighbors know how to live.  Intensive. Hmm\u2026 I bet they won't have-  Wow, they have it!  \"Canned Bread\"! This town is great!  I would really be impressed if it had---  ---an interpretive dance academy?!?  Yeah! It's even better in a group!  This town is perfect.  A clarinet trio?!  Aah, another great day.  Oh look! Everybody's on their bike today.  It just gets better and better!  All together!  I sorta... don't feel like playing my clarinet today.  Yep, this is great. They might as well rename this town \"Squidward's Paradise.\" Or perhaps \"too much paradise.\"  SpongeBob?  Oops.  Leaves. Just getting the leaves.\nSquidette: Would you pipe down over there, iron lung?\nSquidward: Looks like when it comes to having fun, you don't have a \"leg\" to stand on!\nSquidette: Hey! That's not funny!\nOctopus #1: Yeah!\nOctopus #2: What's going on over here?\nSquidette: It's that guy! He's playing with a reef blower!\nOctopus #2: Playing? With a reef blower? That's the most childish thing I've ever heard of!\nSquidward: But it's fun!\nOctopus #2: How could you possibly have fun with one of those oversized hair dryers?\nSquidward: Like this!\nOctopus #2: Give it back! Please!\nSquidward: Tag! You're it!\nOctopus on bike: Wah!  Le Caf\xe9\nSquidette: What can I get you boys?\nOctopus: What are you looking at?\nOctopus #2: Those.\nSpongeBob: Here it is, Patrick.

We finally found you!\nOctopus: Get off me! I'm not Squidward!\nPatrick: Are you Squidward now?\nSquidward: Grievances! This town is a grievance! There should be a law against so many stuck-up tightwads living in one place! This city needs to be destroyed!\u2026 or at least painted a different color.\nPoliceman: FYI, you don't have to live here, you know!\nSquidward: Hey, you're right!

Attention, Bikini Bottom, the time has come to double, no, triple our efforts!\nSquidward: How about a break?!

You put in  a hard day's work, boys!\nPatrick: But I don't work here!\nMr. Krabs: See you later! Oh, that was a close one.\nSpongeBob: What do you want to do today?\nPatrick: I don't know. What do you want to do today?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. What do you want to do today?\nPatrick: I don't know. What do you want to do today?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. What do you want to do today?\nPatrick: I know what I want to do today!  I need some money.  Uh.  Oh.  Oh...   I don't have any money.  SpongeBob, I want a balloon really, really badly!  Really, really badly!\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick.  There's lots of money in the First National Bank of SpongeBob.  Follow me!  Uh-oh. I'm broke, too.  Maybe we could borrow money from Squidward?\nPatrick: No, wait!  Instead of borrowing the money, why don't we just borrow the balloon?!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, like Mr. Krabs!\nPatrick: It's just borrowing, right?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, and borrowing is okay as long as we bring it back, right?\nPatrick: Right!\nPatrick: This is so great!\nSpongeBob: We're going to have so much fun! First we can run with the balloon!\nPatrick: Yeah, then we can go to the beach with the balloon!\nSpongeBob: Yeah! then we can take a bike ride with the balloon. Then we can go to the movies and the arcade and the ice rink and the pizza shop!\nPatrick: And the moon and the sky and under a car, behind the dumpster!\nSpongeBob: And the candy shop!\nPatrick: And then my backyard!\nSpongeBob: And in a plane!\nPatrick: And over a rock!\nSpongeBob: And under a hill!\nPatrick: And with a whale!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We love borrowing!\nSpongeBob: It popped.\nPatrick: How are we going to return it now, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I got the pieces!\nPatrick: I got the air!\nSpongeBob: Hurry, put the pieces on!  We popped the balloon!\nPatrick: Ga-heh!\nSpongeBob: We can't return it!\nPatrick: Wha-guh!\nSpongeBob: We're thieves!\nPatrick: Hi-yo-hoo!\nSpongeBob: We have to confess.\nPatrick: Confess?!  Are you out of your mind?! Do you have any idea what they do to people like us? We're not talking about some dumb mail fraud scheme or a hijacking here.   We stole a Balloon!   And they're going to lock us up forever.\nSpongeBob: You're right,   we've just got to keep our heads. Act normal.\nFrankie Billy: Wow, street performers!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: It's not working!\nLou: Hi there!\nLou: Hey! Don't you want a free balloon? It's National Free Balloon Day!\nPatrick: He's onto us!\nSpongeBob: It's not safe for Bikini Bottom anymore. We've got to move fast and cover our tracks.\nPatrick: I'm on it, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Take a last look Patrick. We can never go back.\nPatrick: Goodbye, Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: We've only got ourselves and what we can carry on our backs.\nPatrick: Yup.\nSpongeBob: We're going to have to travel lighter.\nPatrick: I wanna go home.\nSpongeBob: We can never go home, Pat. We're wanted men.  We'll spend the rest of our lives running...running, but at least it's warmer on the fire.\nPatrick: Hey, if we're underwater, how could there be a...\nPatrick: I'm scared, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: No more nice, warm beds.\nPatrick: Hey.\nSpongeBob: No more Krabby Patties.\nPatrick: Oh!\nSpongeBob: No more getting mail! (Originally \"No more getting nailed! Followed by Patrick nailing himself)  No more Gary!   No more movies!  No more Squidward!   No more Sandy or Pearl or Mr. Krabs!   No more anything!\nPatrick: I want ice cream!\nSpongeBob: But it doesn't have to be all bad, right? I mean, at least we have each other.\nPatrick: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: And  all that running is good for your buns and thighs, right?\nMuscleman: Ya! Buns and thighs.\nPatrick: And the bitter cold, it's bracing, isn't it?!\nSpongeBob: Yeah! Maybe being a felon could be...  ...fun!  We can loosen our ties.\nPatrick: Yeah!  And we can fly!\nSpongeBob: Yeah!  Okay... we still can't do that!  But at least we don't have to shave.\nPatrick: I'm way ahead of you, buddy!\nSpongeBob: And you get to talk tough!   This town ain't big enough for the two of us.\nPatrick: Uh, let me try: Uh...hey, punk.\nSpongeBob: And the best part is: now that we're felons, we don't have to return anything we borrowed!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!\nPatrick: And we owe it all to  you.\nSpongeBob: What are you talking about? Taking the balloon was your evil plan.\nPatrick: Oh, I'm nothing but a lot of talk! You're the one with the sticky fingers.\nSpongeBob: Aw, Patrick...  you're the best bad influence ever!\nPatrick: You, too!  I wish we had something to eat, though.\nSpongeBob: Look what I've got!\nPatrick: Rectangles!\nSpongeBob: Not just any rectangles... Candy bars!\nPatrick: Oh!\nSpongeBob: All we have to do is make them last for the rest of our lives!\nPatrick: Thanks SpongeBob. I think I'll eat it now!  I think I'll eat it now.  Ow! Who?  Where'd my candy bar go?  I must have dropped it.\nSpongeBob: You just ate it, Pat. It's all over your face.\nPatrick: Where'd it go? I'm gonna starve.  Where'd it go?\nPatrick: I can't find it!  Where could it possibly be?  Ahaha!\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: You stole my candy bar!\nSpongeBob: No, I didn't.\nPatrick: Oh, so that's how it is, huh? Once a thief, always a thief.\nSpongeBob: You ate yours,  this is mine.\nPatrick: You took my only food,  now I'm gonna starve.\nSpongeBob: Here Patrick, just take half of mine.\nPatrick: Yours? You mean mine.\nSpongeBob: Do you want it or what?\nPatrick: I don't want it unless you admit you took it.\nSpongeBob: This is my candy bar!\nPatrick: Liar, liar, plants for hire.\nSpongeBob: It's \"pants on fire\", Patrick.\nPatrick: Well, you would know... liar.\nSpongeBob: Well, if you're going to be that way... I'll eat it myself.\nPatrick: You better not!   I'm warning you!\nPatrick: Don't!\nPatrick: Stop it!\nPatrick:  Don't!  Oh!\nPatrick: Ah!   Ah!   You're a crazy person! I should have expected this after the way you stole that balloon!\nSpongeBob: Did I, Patrick, did I? Or did your criminal mind hypnotize me to steal it?!\nPatrick: Oh, that's it!  Yow!  First the balloon, now my candy bar... you're out of control! I'm...  ...I'm telling on you.\nSpongeBob: Not if I tell on you first!\nPatrick: I'll beat you there!\nSpongeBob: You're going to get in trouble.\nPatrick: No, you are!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: He.. When.. him...  and the balloon.. and the boom... I...\nOfficer Rob: What can I do for you, boys?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We stole a balloon!\nPatrick: I'm not good.\nSpongeBob: We stole a balloon.\nOfficer John: What's the problem here?\nOfficer Rob: Well, it appears these two stole a balloon.\nSpongeBob: What are you going to do to us?\nOfficer Rob: Okay, follow me.   If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.  Okay, time's up.  Now, get out.\nSpongeBob: But...But...we stole a balloon.\nOfficer Rob: Yeah, on Free Balloon Day.\nHow about some lollipops for the roads, boys?\nSpongeBob: Let's vow never to borrow anything without permission again.\nPatrick: You said it!  All right! Which one of you flatfoots stole my lollipop?  I mean it.\n","28\nChristmas Who?\nNarrator: And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate.\nPatchy: Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho.  Oh! Hi.  I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club!  Hey, that's better!\nPotty: Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!\nPatchy: That's right, Potty! It is Christmas.  And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year.  Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now!\nSpongeBob: I sure am!  I'm ready!\nPatchy: Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae.  And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating.  I too am also preparing for Christmas.  Hmm, unbaked cookie dough!  Mmm...\nPotty: Potty want cookie dough!  Cookie!\nPatchy: Potty! No!\nPotty: Cookie!\nPatchy: Get out of here!\nPotty: Cookie!\nPatchy: Potty!\nPotty: Give us a lick!\nPatchy: Back off, you flying freak!\nPotty: Clarify please.\nPatchy: This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots.  What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means!\nChildren: Free ice cream!\nPatchy: No, you silly livers.  No!\nPotty: Man overboard?\nPatchy: You, I'm ignoring.  No, it means it's time to open fan letters!\nPotty: Here you go!\nPatchy: Thank you, Potty.  Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you!  Come on, give it, you birdbrain!  Quiet, infernal bird!  Hmm.  This letter comes to us from...\nFish Head: Name and address withheld!\nPatchy: And he writes, \"Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours...\"\nFish Head: Name and address withheld!\nPatchy: A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom.\nPotty: They didn't?\nPatchy: No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain.  There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom.  Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas?  Potty?  You ate all me cookie dough!\nPotty: Squ-ouch!\nPatchy: Oh, well. On with the show.\nSpongeBob: Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move.\nSpongeBob: What diabolical act is she committing now?  Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire!  Huh? So I guess there's no fire?\nSandy: What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?\nSpongeBob: Christmas who?\nSandy: What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?\nSpongeBob: Is she a friend from Texas?\nSandy: No. I can't believe you haven't heard of...  ...Christmas.\nSpongeBob: Tell me more about this...  ...\"Christmas.\"\nPatchy: And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus.\nSpongeBob: And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.\nSquidward: Yawn.\nSpongeBob: But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.\nPatrick: Just like a genie. (laughs)\nMr. Krabs: I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.\nSpongeBob: That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs.  Here you go! You can get started on your letter.\nSquidward: I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.\nPatrick: Like a genie.\nMr. Krabs: Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.\nSquidward: Oh, brother.\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: Okay, who's next?\nPatrick: Ooh, ooh, me, me!\nSquidward: Ooh.\nSpongeBob: Here you go, Patrick.\nPatrick: There's no words on this paper.\nSpongeBob: Not yet.\nPatrick: Yippee! A writing stick.\nSpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?\nSpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid...  ...ward.\nPatrick: Uhh, SpongeBob...  Thanks.  Dear Sant...  D'oh! Not again.\nSpongeBob: Here, Patrick, watch me. Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish.  Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!\nPatrick: Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?\nSpongeBob: Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.\nMr. Krabs: Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.\nSpongeBob: Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?\nMr. Krabs: A pony.\nSpongeBob: Really?\nMr. Krabs: With saddle bags full of money!\nPatrick: Here you go, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: What did you wish for, Patrick?\nPatrick: Another piece of paper.\nSpongeBob: And what did you wish for, little girl?\nSusie: Front teeth!\nCowboy: I could use a new hat!\nJennifer-Millie: I need a new hairstyle!\nLonnie: How about a glass of water for my teeth?\nSquidward: Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.\nSpongeBob: Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?\nSquidward: My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.\nSpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.\nEveryone: Hooray!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aIt's shaping up to be a wonderful holiday. Not your normal, average, everyday.\u266a\nSquidward: \u266aSounds like someone felled my old coral tree! SpongeBob, Patrick, why'd you do this to me?\u266a\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aThe world feels like it's in loverly!\u266a\nSquidward: \u266aGo away before I harm you bodily!\u266a\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aThis Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me! There'll be shopping, decorating, and plenty of snow! Hey, Patrick, who's that under the mistletoe?\u266a\nSquidward: \u266aWhat? Who, me? Would you look at the time, I should go!\u266a\nPlankton: \u266aPeople seem a little more brotherly!\u266a\nMr. Krabs: \u266aHere's a special something to you from me!\u266a\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aEven all the trash, on Christmas it smells so sweetly! This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me!\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!\u266a\nSquidward: \u266aWhat do you want? Can't you see that I'm busy!?\u266a\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aStep outside, we've got something for you to see!\u266a\nSquidward: \u266aSpongeBob, take this stuff down immediately!\u266a\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aChestnuts roasting and burns in the third degree!\u266a\nCitizens: \u266aTonight things are as good as they seem to be!\u266a\nPatrick: \u266aA star on top will complete all the scenery!\u266a\nCitizens: \u266aThis Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me! This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas to me!\u266a\nPatchy: Is Squidward right? Can there be a Christmas under the sea? Stay tuned! Whoa!  It's about time you got back! Now I can finish me story! So, SpongeBob was sending the last of the letters to Santa...\nMartin: I hope he can read Portuguese.\nSpongeBob: Ahh, that's the last letter. Huh? Wait! Squidward hasn't written his letter yet!  Squidward! Hurry! Squidward, Squidward! Hurry!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing?\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll help you get started.  Dear Santa Claus...\nSquidward: SpongeBob, forget it.\nSpongeBob: Right, too formal. Hi Santa...\nSquidward: SpongeBob, no.\nSpongeBob: Howdy, Claus?\nSquidward: I'm not writing a letter to a figment of your imagination.\nSpongeBob: But, Squidward, when Santa comes, you'll be the only one without a gift.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, how many times do I have to say it? I don't believe in Santa Claus!\nSpongeBob: C\u2019mon, Squid, all you have to do is write a letter. What have you got to lose?\nSquidward: My self-respect. My sanity. My lunch.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, c'mon.\nCitizens: C\u2019mon, Squidward! Don't be a party pooper! C'mon out!\nSquidward: Santa Claus is a big phony! SpongeBob has got you all fooled!\nSpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. C'mon!\nSquidward: Those idiots are gonna be up all night while I get a full night\u2019s sleep.\nCitizens: \u266aOh, Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight. Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.\u266a\nSpongeBob: C\u2019mon everybody! Let's sing till Santa gets here.\nCitizens: \u266aOh, Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa\u2019s coming tonight. Santa's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming...\u266a\nCitizens: \u266aSanta's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.\u266a\nFred: Hey! Where's Santa?\nSpongeBob: Uh, he should be here any minute. \u266aSanta's coming tonight, tonight. Santa's coming tonight.\u266a\nCitizens: Oh, c'mon. Enough of this.\nFred: Thanks for the lies, Mr. Fairytale! Let's go waste our time somewhere else.\nSpongeBob: Hey, guys, where's your Christmas Spirit? He's just running late.\nPatrick: He probably just stopped for a snack! Fat guys get hungry right?\nSpongeBob: Yeah!\nPatrick: Never trust a genie.\nSquidward: Ahh, morning already? Oh, boy!  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. Wait. Oh, I see a great Christmas photo op. Could you move in a little? Say Santa Claus.\nSpongeBob: Santa Claus.\nSquidward: Aww, our first Christmas. This Christmas feels like the very first Christmas. The first Christmas is this Christmas.  Cause it feels like the first Christmas to me.\nSpongeBob: You were right, Squidward. This is a stupid holiday.  I still want you to have this.\nSquidward: What? What's this?\nSpongeBob: A present. I made it for you so you wouldn't be left out when... Santa came! \"\"\nSquidward: Oh, gee, I, uh, you know I...\nSpongeBob: You're welcome.\nSquidward: SpongeBob? He made me a present? It's probably a jellyfish net, or an old Krabby patty, or...  his favorite underpants. Haha.  Why, it looks like a clarinet.  It smells like one, too. Handcrafted on driftwood. And it's even got my name on it.  What's this?  Wow. This is the greatest gift I've ever gotten. Oh, I feel like a... I feel like a... I feel like a...  big jerk. What have I done to poor SpongeBob? Uh, hey, SpongeBob? I... SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I guess I won't be needing this.  That's better.\nSquidward: Poor little guy. All he wanted was to spread a little joy.\nSpongeBob: I better get this stuff off of Squid's house.\nSquidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!\nSpongeBob: Huh? Hello? Who's there? Huh? Hello?\nSquidward: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!\nSpongeBob: Hello? Yes. Who's there? Huh? Hello? Show yourself. Yoo-hoo. Hello? Who is it? Huh?\nSquidward: Up here you dunce.

SpongeBob?!\nSpongeBob: S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-San...\nSquidward: Don't do that again.\nSpongeBob: I knew you'd make it, Santa. Hey, Santa, where's your big, round belly?\nSquidward: Well, that, um, is a result of, uh, undersea pressure on my body.\nSpongeBob: Where's your reindeer? And your flying machine?\nSquidward: Uhh, I loaned them to the Easter bunny.\nSpongeBob: And what about that nose?  I knew you were suppose to have a big one but, that thing's gigantic.\nSquidward: Alright! I'm Santa.\nSpongeBob: Santa! This is the greatest you could've given me. Thank you for bringing Christmas to Bikini Bottom.\nSquidward: I didn't bring Christmas to Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob; you did.\nSpongeBob: I did?\nGary: Meow.\nSquidward: Merry Christmas, SpongeBob. Merry Christmas! Whew! I'm glad that's over.\nShelly: Do you have a present for me, Santa?\nSquidward: Oh, well, uhh, you see, I'm not really...\nSpongeBob: Go ahead, Santa Claus. See, he is real. He made my Christmas wish come true, he won't let you down.\nSquidward: Uhh, right, just a second.  C'mon, let's see. What do little girls like? A box of matches? Or a shaving kit? A copy of my birth certificate? There's got to be something around here. Think. Think. Think. Ha! Perfect!  There you go, little girl! Ho, ho, ho!\nShelly: Thanks, Santa.\nSquidward: That almost felt good.  I didn't... who?\nFred: Hey, Santa, where's my present?\nOld Man Jenkins: And mine!\nAbigail-Marge: And what about me?\nSquidward: Uhh... let's see what Santa has for all you good people.  Think fast, Santa. Gifts for good people. A-ha! A bowl of mashed potatoes for you.\nJennifer-Millie: Thank you, Santa. This is just what I wanted.  A new hairstyle.\nSquidward: Here you go, Patrick.\nPatrick: Wow.  A wrist watch.\nSquidward: What was I thinking? I gave away all my stuff just 'cause SpongeBob wouldn't be sad. Am I insane?  You might as well take the door. It's all that's left.\nSpongeBob: Squidward! You missed him! He was here just like I said! He gave us all presents. He was jolly and he had a beard. His nose was big and he had rosy cheeks. He was friendly and kind.  And Santa is... oh, his belly was small but his nose was huge with Christmas joy. He was so nice Squidward...\nSquidward: Well, at least it's over.  Huh? What's this?\nSanta: Dear Squidward, thanks for all your help! You've been a real good boy this year. Warm regards, Santa Claus.  Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho.\nSquidward: Yup, I'm insane.\nSanta: Merry Christmas!\nPatchy: Dee dee, dee dee dee dee.\nSpongeBob: Ahoy, Patrick! It's Christmas Island!\nPatrick: Presents, ahoy.\nSpongeBob: Hooray!  Oh, a storm!\nPatrick: Yay! I mean yikes!\nPatchy: Oh, we're going down!  Trim the sails! Hoist the yardarms! Turn on the Weather Channel!\nMan on Set: Patchy?\nPatchy: Oh, hi kids. Boy, that SpongeBob makes me as jolly as a roger. Well, I hope you enjoyed SpongeBob's Christmas tale. And I hope your Christmas is better than sunken treasure.  Aw... Potty left me a little Christmas present.  Arr, ye old mistletoe. And you know what that means.  Ah, time for somebody to kiss Patchy the Pirate!  Come on, who's it gonna be? Come on! Kiss the captain!\nPotty: Give us a kiss!\nPatchy: No! No, not you!  No, not you Potty! Get out of here! No, Potty! I don't wanna kiss you! No, we talked about this. Potty! No!\nPotty: Kissy, kissy!\nNarrator: Well, it looks like Patchy's pretty busy at the moment, so I'll say it for him. Good night, and happy holidays.\n","29a\nSurvival of the Idiots\nSpongeBob: Alright, we're gonna go to Sandy's house! Yeah! Ha-ha! Keep the tree warm, Sandy, we're on our way to your house! Ha-ha-ha...\nPatrick: Yay! Yay! Ha-ha! I'm gonna beat you there! I'm gonna... ah, it's gonna be fun! Ah-ha...\nSpongeBob: Sandy?  Hey, Sandy, what's with the sign?\nPatrick: Look, she's on the Eating Channel.\nSandy: Howdy!  If y'all are watching this, that means I'm asleep for the winter. This sleep is called hibernation.  During hibernation, animals don't like to be woken up. So do not disturb.  That means you, SpongeBob.\nPatrick: We better put these on.\nSpongeBob: Never mind, Pat. Sandy said not to come in. Let's am-scray.\nPatrick: When are you gonna learn, SpongeBob? \"No\" means \"yes\"!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, listen, how many times do we have to-?\nPatrick: SpongeBob, look at this!\nSpongeBob: What is this stuff?\nPatrick: It's a vast, swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. Let it fill your senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as you've never felt before.\nSpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, that was beautiful.\nPatrick: What, I was just reading this candy bar wrapper, see?\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Put your helmet back on!  You know there's no water in Sandy's house!\nPatrick: It's okay, SpongeBob. This stuff is water! Look!\nSpongeBob: I guess you're right. It's okay here!\nPatrick: Take it off. No one's looking.  SpongeBob, did you hear that?\nSpongeBob: I think it came from Sandy's tree.\nPatrick: That is one tired tree.\nSpongeBob: Let's check it out.  Look what's in Sandy's bed!\nPatrick: Looks like an over-inflated Sandy doll!\nSpongeBob: I think this thing is Sandy.\nPatrick: Hibernation must mean the opposite of beauty sleep.\nSandy: I've had enough of your dastardly deeds, Dirty Dan. I'm gonna get you and your partner, Pinhead Larry or my name ain't Sheriff... Sandy...\nSpongeBob: She must be dreaming about Texas outlaws.  Look out, Sandy, I'm Dirty Dan.\nSandy: I'm gonna catch you and throw you in jail at taxpayers' expense.\nSpongeBob: Oh, you better run faster, Sandy.\nPatrick: Yeah! I'm getting away! Faster!\nSpongeBob: Hurry, we're getting in a taxi!\nPatrick: Faster, faster!\nSandy: I'll get you two. You're nothing but pure evil! Just like newspaper comics...\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. We shouldn't disturb her anymore.\nPatrick: That's not disturbing. This is disturbing!  Hi there, SpongeBob. My name is Patback.\nSpongeBob: Ha! That is really disturbing!\nPatrick: Uh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nPatrick: Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us!\nSpongeBob: Sandy! No! Stop!\nSandy: I warned ya, Dirty Dan! Now, you've just crossed the border into Hurtville!\nSpongeBob: Sandy, it's us, your friends! SpongeBob and Patrick!\nPatrick: Please, Sandy, I can't afford dry cleaning!\nSandy: Gonna skin y'all and make a pair of size six...boots...\nPatrick: Fun's over.\nSpongeBob: Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her.\nPatrick: Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint.\nSpongeBob: All right, Pat!\nSandy: I'm gonna rip your arms off and.... flapjacks?\nSpongeBob: Well, that oughta work.\nPatrick: Hey, Sandy, does it work?\nSpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, if you can't hear us, don't say anything!\nPatrick: Hey, Sandy! Don't wake up!\nSpongeBob: See ya later, Sheriff Sandy!  You're under arrest!\nPatrick: You'll never catch me!  Hey, that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons.\nSpongeBob: They couldn't afford station wagons either!\nPatrick: Nice paneling.\nSpongeBob: All right, Pinhead. Your time is up!\nPatrick: Who you calling Pinhead?

It's frozen shut!\nPatrick: Let me have a try.  Open sesame!  Well, I've done all I can do.\nSpongeBob: Then we're stuck in here...until the door thaws...in spring.\nPatrick: Barnacles.  Is it spring yet?\nSpongeBob: N-n-n-no.\nPatrick: I'm so cold that I'm shivering!\nSpongeBob: I'm so cold...  that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks!\nPatrick: I'm so cold that...I'm shivering!\nSpongeBob: Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree!\nSandy: You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead!\nSpongeBob: The fire's not gonna happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?\nPatrick: Maybe she just ignores it.\nSpongeBob: Maybe...\nPatrick: Maybe...\nSpongeBob: Maybe it's her fur!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Look at all that warm, toasty fur.\nPatrick: It's like a gold mine, but with fur.\nSpongeBob: Carefully...carefully?\nPatrick: Come on, do it! I'm freezing here!\nSpongeBob: All right, all right, hang on a second!  That should be enough, right?\nPatrick: Sponge, I'm a big man. A big, BIG man!\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I've lived a full life!\nPatrick: This is taking too long! I want the warm NOW!\nSpongeBob: Pat, no!\nSpongeBob: Pat, are you crazy?!\nPatrick: No, I'm warm.\nSpongeBob: Let me see that roll of tape.\nPatrick: Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits.\nSpongeBob: And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we've ever had.\nPatrick: You said it!\nSpongeBob: I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Bring it on!\nSpongeBob: Spring?\nSandy: Wow, spring already?\nSpongeBob: Tartar sauce! The lock is still frozen!\nSandy: I sure can't wait to go outside and warm my fur!\nSandy: Oh, look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick!\nSandy: Hey, guys!\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals!\nSandy: SpongeBob...

We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games\u2026\nSpongeBob: Gee, this is great.

Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now.  Gary the Snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me this instant!  Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary.\nPatrick: Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants!\nSpongeBob: What's that supposed to mean?\nPatrick: I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. Now, I suggest that you put him down and let him choose.\nSpongeBob: Fine, but I would like to remind him who it was who fed him and housed him and sat on his bedside when he was sick and massaged his eyestalks when his eyes were sore! Okay, Gary, go ahead, show him. Okay, Gary, come to me! Come on, come on, Gary! Come on, come here, Gary!  Uh, wrong way, Gary.  G-Gary, turn around! Gary, no, Gary, no, no, no! Don't do it, Gary!\nPatrick: Well, well, well\u2026 I guess that answers that question.  So long, SpongeBob. Me and Gary got stuff to do.\nSpongeBob: Okay, fine, if that's how you want to thank me\u2026  ...for all that I've done?!  I guess you're not coming back, Gary.  I don't need Gary! I'll just find another pet! Yeah, it'll be better than Gary! I'm going to get a pet that won't go off with my best friend!  Hi, guys! Say hello to my new pal Rex!  Not only is he loyal, but he knows tricks, too! Watch and learn. Sit, Rex, sit!  Roll over, Rex, roll over!  Now stay, Rex, stay! Good boy, Rex! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?  I'm sure glad we went our separate ways, Gary. A worm really is the pet for me.  So loyal, so trusting, always by my side!  Who needs worms anyway?  Welcome home, newest bestest friend. Come on out, don't be shy.  You remind me of someone I once knew. A certain someone who's name will not be spoken in this household. Come on, let me show you around, Lary.\nLary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: And now, Lary, I present to you\u2026 dinner time! Ta-da.  Bon appetite, Lary.  Okay, maybe later.  This is where you sleep, Lary.  Uh, that's where I\u2026  I guess you can sleep there\u2026  I'll just sleep down here.  Well, good night, Lary.  Hey, Lary, want to hear a joke? Aw, Gary used to love this one!  What do you call a snail on a ship? A snailor!  Don't you get it, Lary? A snailor.  Gosh, Lary is sure different than Gary. And Gary and Lary are real different than Jerry.  Oh, Gary, why did you have to go?!  Why, Gary?! Why\u2026?! Why, why, why, why, why?!  Gary?\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Oh, hello, Patrick.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Hello, Gary.\nPatrick: Would it be all right if me and Gary did some laundry around here?\nSpongeBob: Laundry? But\u2026 we used to do laundry\u2026\nPatrick: And uh, SpongeBob, could we borrow some soap?\nSpongeBob: Soap? But\u2026 we used to use soap.  Do you want 'Fresh Scent' or 'Heavy Du'\u2026\nPatrick: Here it comes\u2026\nSpongeBob: Du\u2026 du\u2026 duuuuu\u2026  ttyyyyy!  Gary! Please come back, Gary! Please come home! I'm a wreck without you!  I know. If you come back, there'll be a new no-rules rule. You can do whatever you want, when you want.  If you feel like rippin' the sofa, then you rip it up!  And the litter box? Forget about it!  The world is your litter box!  And you don't even have to wait around for me to feed you anymore! 24-hour fridge access!  And you don't even have to use a bowl!  And I know how much you like my prized drift wood carving of Squidward.  Well, think of it as your own personal scratching post! What do you think, Gary? Won't it be fun, Gary?\nPatrick: How pathetic\u2026\nSpongeBob: Gary\u2026?\nPatrick: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. But Gary's with me now. You had your chance and you failed. You have to stop living in the past. Face it, SpongeBob, you're only hurting yourself.  It's what Gary wants, and what Gary wants is me! Right, Gary?  He only liked me for my shorts!\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. He wanted the cookie in your pocket!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: G-G-Gary?  Whee!  Oh, Gary, I knew you'd never leave me!

Today is once again the day of SpongeBob's boating school exam. But more importantly, this is the last test for the year,  and if SpongeBob does not pass this one, it means another  whole year of boating school!\nSpongeBob: What happened?\nMrs. Puff: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob, you just struck another pedestrian.  Minus 20 more points.\nSpongeBob: How many does that leave me with?\nMrs. Puff: Negative 224.\nSpongeBob: How many more minutes left in the test?\nMrs. Puff: The test is over.\nSpongeBob: That's enough time, I can make up those points!\nMrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you didn't hear me!  It's too late, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Okay, Mrs. Puff, what's my final score?\nMrs. Puff: Six.\nSpongeBob: Whoo! And how many do I need to pass?\nMrs. Puff: Six.\nSpongeBob: Whoo.\nMrs. Puff: Hundred.\nSpongeBob: What?\nMrs. Puff: 600. You need 600 to pass. You got six.\nSpongeBob: Don't worry. I'll be all right, Mrs. Puff. Besides, this means that I get to be in your class for a whole 'nother year!  Well, see you next Tuesday!  Yeah!  I'm gonna get my driver's license and it's only gonna take one more year, one more year, one more superduper year.  One more super-spectacular, extra-magical, extra-fantastical year!\nMrs. Puff: Oh, Neptune. Another year with him! Barnacles! Dirty barnacles! I've got to do something to save myself. Oh, there's only one way out: a teacher's ace in the hole!  Extra crediiiiit!\nSpongeBob: What was that, Mrs. Puff?\nMrs. Puff: Extra credit, SpongeBob! The extra credit!  I still have a chance! I mean, you still have a chance.\nSpongeBob: What's extra credit?\nMrs. Puff: It's when you get credit for the things you weren't able to do before.\nSpongeBob: Oh\u2026..\nMrs. Puff: Now, are we ready for that extra credit?\nSpongeBob: Extra credit!\nMrs. Puff: That's the spirit. So all you have to do to earn your extra credit and pass my class, and never have to go anywhere near this school again, is to write a ten-word sentence on what you've learned in boating school.\nSpongeBob: But I've learned so many things.\nMrs. Puff: Just pick one, I don't care which. Here, I'll help you get started.  \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026\" There! That's already seven words! Only three more!\nSpongeBob: L\u2026 e\u2026 a\u2026 r\u2026  Oh, barnacles.\nMrs. Puff: What's wrong?\nSpongeBob: Got to sharpen my pencil.  N\u2026 e\u2026\nMrs. Puff: Give me that! Here's a pen.\nSpongeBob: A pen! One of the most permanent of all writing utensils.  Gonna write an essay, that's what I say.  There.\nMrs. Puff: Fantastic, let me see it.\nSpongeBob: No, wait! I changed my mind!\nMrs. Puff: I'm sure whatever you've written is fine, just let me see.\nSpongeBob: Don't look! It's not ready.\nMrs. Puff: It's so simple, only ten words! \"What I learned in boating school is blankity, blankity,  Blank!\"\nSpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!\nMrs. Puff: \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026!\" \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026!\"\nSpongeBob: I can do this! I can do this!  Is it hot in here, Mrs. Puff? Why is it so hot in here?  My hand is cramping, Mrs. Puff! Make it stop!\nMrs. Puff: You only need three\u2026 more\u2026 words!  Okay, let me see what you've written.\nSpongeBob: It's not ready yet.\nMrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob. Show the teacher what you've written.\nSpongeBob: No!\nMrs. Puff: Give it to me!\nSpongeBob: No!\nMrs. Puff: Let me see it!  \"What I learned in boating school is\u2026\" Uh\u2026  Well, the rest doesn't matter!  You pass!  You pass!\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I don't feel like I really did anything.\nMrs. Puff: That's how extra credit is supposed to feel.\nSpongeBob: Really?\nMrs. Puff: Besides, here's your license.\nSpongeBob: My license!  It tastes just like I dreamt it would. Mrs. Puff, I-\nMrs. Puff: Thank you, SpongeBob. Congratulations, and have a nice life!\nSpongeBob: Look out, Bikini Bottom! There's a new driver on the road and his name is...SpongeBob SquarePants!  SpongeBob SquarePants! SpongeBob SquarePants!  La La La La!  La La La La!\nFish: Ow!\nPartygoers: Harris, happy birthday!  My leg!\nNews Reporter: So much destruction...this reporter asks, \"Why?\" Local consensus places the blame on this negligent, selfish driving instructor who-  Oof!\nSpongeBob: La la la la!\nReporter: Let's- not- use that take.\nMrs. Puff: That's preposterous. He did the extra credit. There's no need to worry. He doesn't even have a boat to drive.  Now to go home and have the rest of that pasta.\nThe SquarePants': Surprise!\nSpongeBob: To the greatest teacher ever!\nMr. SquarePants: Thank you, Mrs Puff. I know I speak for everyone when I say that we consider you a member of the SquarePants family.\nMrs. SquarePants: I think you made your point, dear.\nMr. SquarePants: Ahem.  Mrs. Puff, we were starting to think SpongeBob was never going to get his license. But you never gave up on him, you never quit, you never took the easy way out!\nMrs. Puff: Well, I... Okay.\nMrs. SquarePants: We wanted to make sure Mrs. Puff, the greatest driving teacher in the world, was here to see this...\nMrs. Puff: See what?\nMr. SquarePants: Ta-da.  \"IM-RDY\".\nMrs. Puff and SpongeBob: A brand new boatmobile?!\nSpongeBob: For me...?\nMrs. SquarePants: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff... He'll be driving by tomorrow! Toodle-Loo!\nMrs. Puff: What have I done?! Everyone will know I let him slide through school! I'll have to move to new city, start a new boating school with a new name! No. Not again. I've got to end this before it begins.\nMr. SquarePants: You took quite a buster there, Son.\nSpongeBob: What I learned in Boating School today is!\nMr. SquarePants: We're gonna have to hold off on the driving there for a while, son.\nMrs. SquarePants: That's right, honey. Now, just stay in bed, and no going near the boat.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Boaty.  Boaty, you're cold!  Take my socks.  Oh, Boaty, I'm always going to take care of you. You're the best boat in the deep blue sea!\nMrs. Puff: I hope I still remember how to do this.  Oh yeah\u2026\nSpongeBob: Hey, I'm driving!  Who are you and what are you doing with my boat? And why are you wearing that ski mask?! Because you're not skiing!  Oh my gosh, I know who you are!\nMrs. Puff: No, you don't! You don't know who I am!\nSpongeBob: Yes, I do! I know that you're... a boat-jacker! I never thought I'd have to use this pepper spray!  Somebody help me! Somebody help me!\nMrs. Puff: Sorry, SpongeBob, but it was for your own good.\nSpongeBob: Give me back my boat!  You'd better stop this boat!  I'm\u2026 not\u2026 letting\u2026 go! Nothing will stop me! Not even\u2026  Giant clams?!  I'm\u2026 not\u2026 letting\u2026 go\u2026 not even for\u2026  Cheese graters?!  If you think I'll let go just for a little\u2026  educational television?! Oh, no!\nMrs. Puff: Looks like that got rid of him. Now for some tunes!\nSpongeBob as Radio: And now back to KRUD, with all of your personal \"you won't get away with stealing my car!\" hits.\nCop 1: Hey, look.\nSpongeBob: I'd never let you have this boat! Not even if you were\u2026  \u2026 Mrs. Puff?  So, how's it going, Mrs. Puff?\nMrs. Puff: Uh, SpongeBob? I'd like to\u2026 apologize. I never should have passed you. You really weren't ready.\nSpongeBob: So, I guess I got to give my license back, huh?\nMrs. Puff: I hear Mrs. Flounder is starting a new class Monday morning.\nSpongeBob: You kidding? You're the only teacher for this student . And besides, the warden said she'll let you go early, if you do her a favor?\nMrs. Puff: What's that?\nSpongeBob: Free driving lessons!\n","30b\nI'm Your Biggest Fanatic\nSpongeBob: Wow!

We have got to bring this guy jellyfishing with us!\nAnchovy Jellyspotter: No, Kevin, no. He's a geek.\nKevin: Look, I won't let the guy join the club.

Can I help?\nKevin: Oh, don't worry. We can't do it without you!\nSpongeBob: This is fantastic! I've never been bait before! I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either.\nKevin: Well, then you've probably never used a queen jellyfish call. Why don't you try it out?\nSpongeBob: Hey, I've heard this call before.\nKevin: I'll bet you have.\nSpongeBob: Hey, where are you going?\nKevin: Oh, don't worry, we'll be right behind this bush.  Who's got my sting ointment?\nSpongeBob: This is great! When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter!  Hey, Kevin. I don't think it's working. Nothing?  Hey, hey, Kevin! She's here! Look, she's here! She's here, Kevin! She's here?  Please don't be angry, your highness! I would have let you go!  Kevin!\nKevin: That's right! You should have seen the look on your face when we zapped you!\nSpongeBob: But... What about my final test?\nKevin: Did you think we'd actually let you into the Jellyspotters?\nSpongeBob: But, Kevin, I was your biggest fan!\nKevin: So were they.\nGuy: Hey, look, everybody.

How did you know?\nSpongeBob: Everybody loves pie!\nAnchovy Jellyspotter: Wah-wah-waaaaah!\nKevin: Well, SquarePants, that was impressive, but you're still not in the club because you didn't catch a queen jellyfish.  Wait, what are you doing?  Aaah!\nSpongeBob: Wow, I didn't know this was a hat!\nKevin: It wasn't...\nSpongeBob: Hi, Patrick!\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob! Did you get into that club?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but I turned them down. It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish!\nPatrick: Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson.

MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! MUH-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MUH-MA-MUH-MA! Man Ray! Ahh!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how come he's not chasing us?\nSpongeBob: Looks like he's frozen or something.\nPatrick: FRUH-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRUH-FRO-FRUH-FRO.\nSpongeBob: It appears to be some sort of prison chamber...  ...made out of frozen tartar sauce. This is incredible. Next to the Dirty Bubble, the evil Man Ray is the all-time greatest arch nemesis of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. I have so many questions to ask him.  Pat, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything!\nPatrick: But you said you had a question.\nSpongeBob: We could get in trouble.\nPatrick: Well, that's not a question.\nSpongeBob: He said not to touch anything and that includes unfreezing a super-villain!\nMan Ray: I'm free! Hahaha!\nSpongeBob: Uh, actually, Mr. uh... Man Ray, sir, only your head is free.\nMan Ray: By the supreme authority of wickedness, I, the evil Man Ray, command you to release me from this frozen prison at once.\nSpongeBob: Well, uhh, Mr. Evil Man Ray, sir, we can't do that.\nMan Ray: Why... not?!\nSpongeBob: Because you're evil!\nMan Ray: You mean, if I was good, then you'd let me go?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, sure, why not?\nMan Ray: Then, uh, in that case... I am good.\nSpongeBob: Really?\nMan Ray: Yes, really.\nSpongeBob: Really, really?\nMan Ray: Yes, yes, really, really.\nSpongeBob: Really, really, really?\nMan Ray: Yes, yes, already! I'm good! I'm good! Now let me out of here or you'll suffer dire consequences.\nSpongeBob: Well, that's good enough for me.\nMan Ray: You fools, prepare to be eradicated.  What's wrong with me? Hahaha. What is this...Hahaha...infernal contraption?!\nSpongeBob: Don't play dumb, Man Ray! You know that's the tickle belt Mermaid Man used on you in episode #17.\nNarrator: As seen in episode #17!\nPatrick: Oh, I love that episode.\nSpongeBob: Oh, me too, me too.\nMan Ray: I'll never get out of here wearing this belt.  I... I need an evil plan that will trick them to take it off me.  Time for those acting lessons to pay off.\nSpongeBob: Remember that part Mermaid Man and Barnacle...\nMan Ray: Oh, sob! Oh, cry.  Oh, woe is me. You don't know what it's like being evil for so long. Oh, how I wish to be... good. If only some kind heroes would show me the path to decency.\nSpongeBob: We could teach you how to be good and then we'll let you go.\nMan Ray: Ahh, that would be fantastic!  I'll fake my way through this just like I did in high school.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Man Ray. Are you ready first day at goodness school?  Pat, get your wallet out.  Okay, goodness lesson number one. You see someone drop their wallet. Patrick, drop the wallet.  Now, what do you do?\nMan Ray: Excuse me, sir, but I do believe you've dropped your wallet.\nPatrick: Doesn't look familiar to me.\nMan Ray: What? I just saw you drop it. Here.\nPatrick: Nope, it's not mine.\nMan Ray: It is yours. I am trying to be a good person and return it to you.\nPatrick: Return what to who?\nMan Ray: Aren't you Patrick Star?\nPatrick: Yup.\nMan Ray: And this is your ID.\nPatrick: Yup.\nMan Ray: I found this ID in this wallet. And if that's the case, this must be your wallet.\nPatrick: That makes sense to me.\nMan Ray: Then take it.\nPatrick: It's not my wallet.\nMan Ray: You dim bulb! Take back your wallet or I'll rip your arms off!\nSpongeBob: No. Wrong.  Good people don't rip other people's arms off  Okay, goodness lesson number two. You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?\nMan Ray: Hello, friend. I noticed you were struggling with that package. Would you like some help?  Ow!\nPatrick: Oops, sorry. Can I start over?\nMan Ray: I noticed you were...  Ow!\nPatrick: Oops. Gotta start again.\nMan Ray: Could, Ow!\nPatrick: Oops!\nMan Ray: You butter-fingered pink thing! What's in that box anyhow?\nPatrick: My wallets.\nMan Ray: Arghh!\nPatrick: No! SpongeBob, tickle him!\nMan Ray: It tickles, but it's worth it.\nSpongeBob: Alright, goodness lesson number three.  Uhh, let's see.\nPatrick: I've got one. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?\nMan Ray: Umm... 62?\nPatrick: Wrong!\nMan Ray: Haha. Stop.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, that's got nothing to do with being good.\nPatrick: Let go of it, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Pat, we've got to use it only when he's bad.\nPatrick: Let go!\nSpongeBob: No, you let go!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Let go!\nMan Ray: Frequency rising. Belt out of control. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Belt on too hard.  It's tickling my DNA. Make it stop!  Haha. Please!\nSpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? He said the P word.\nPatrick: Peanuts?\nSpongeBob: No. Please.\nPatrick: Well, that's good enough for me. I guess he's reconstituted.\nSpongeBob: Rehabilitated.\nPatrick: Gesundheit.\nSpongeBob: It's graduation day, Man Ray. This is the key to your future.  Just look at him, Patrick. The picture of goodness.  Umm, we're not supposed to touch that stuff.  We're not supposed to touch that, either.  We are really not suppose to touch those, sir.  Good people have no use for weapons such as...  thoooose!\nMan Ray: The only thing I'm good at is being evil.  So long, suckers.\nPatrick: What's that smell, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: That, Patrick, is the smell of defeat.\nPatrick: Good, I thought it was my skin.\nSpongeBob: Forget about your skin, Patrick. Man Ray is still bad and someone has to stop him. This is a job for Mermaid Man...\nPatrick: ...and Barnacle Boy!\nSpongeBob: To the Invisible Boatmobile!\nPatrick: Ignition, on!\nSpongeBob: Wait! I don't have a license.\nPatrick: Well, this is an invisible boat, right? So, you need an invisible license.\nSpongeBob: You're the best sidekick ever, Barnacle Boy.\nPatrick: Thank goodness for invisible seat belts.\nMan Ray: Out of my way, fools. You no longer have control of me. And now this town belongs to Man Ray!\nSpongeBob: Not so fast, arch-villain. We still have the Orb of Confusion.  Take this!  Doy. Duh.\nMan Ray: Well, that was easy.  Hahaha. All right, people! Everybody, stand right where you are.\nMan Ray: I want you to, uh...  No! No! Stop giggling or I'll have to...  Stop laughing, you fools.\nBank Lady: What can I do for you, sir?\nMan Ray: Well, I'll tell you what you can do.  Gimme all of your...  G-gimme, gimme all of your...  Give me...  Ahh! The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle. The urge to do bad is gone.  I guess I'll just open a checking account.\nSpongeBob: Doy.  Man Ray!\nMan Ray: No need to be alarmed, SpongeBob. Your teachings have transformed me. Besides, I have checks... with little poodles on them!  I won't be needing this anymore. Farewell, fellow do-gooder.\nSpongeBob: Bye, Man Ray! Wow. We did it! Just like the real Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. We saved the day. Isn't it incredible, Patrick? Patrick?\nPatrick: Uhh...\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you know that thing's turned off, right? Patrick? Yoo-hoo? Patrick?\n","31b\nSquirrel Jokes\nMr. Krabs: Okay, everybody settle down. Welcome  to the Komedy Krab!  Now please give a warm welcome to our first comic, the indiscernible Dougie Williams.\nDougie Williams: Good evening, folks. I'm going to skip the jokes and get right to the part where I throw pies at you.\nSpongeBob: I hope I do as good as that guy.\nDougie Williams: Man, those people will laugh at anything. Hey, don't sweat it kid, I got them all worked up for you.\nMr. Krabs: Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants.\nSandy: Go get 'em, SpongeBob!\nPatrick: Whoo-hoo!\nSpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey ladies and jellyfish, have you ever noticed salt shakers? I mean, you fill them up every night at closing, and I mean, where does it all go? Huh? You know what I mean?\nSpongeBob: And tomatoes -- what's the deal on those things?  I mean, you chop them up into slices, but...  What are they, vegetables or... fruit? And what does that make? Ketchup?\nFred: Oh, brother, this guy stinks!\nHarold: Hey, hey, funny guy! I've got a joke for you! What smells rotten and puts people to sleep?\nSpongeBob: Umm, noxious gas?\nHarold: No! Your act!\nSpongeBob: Did you ever notice how, uhh...  ...forks, uhh...\nFred: Forks?! Come on!\nSpongeBob: Quick, SpongeBob, make a witty observation!  Did you ever notice how big squirrels' teeth are?\nFish: That's true.\nSandy: Huh?\nSpongeBob: I mean, hey, you could land a plane on those things.  And what's up with all that squirrel fur? I guess fleas need a home, too.\nPatrick: Squirrel fur!\nSpongeBob: And they smell! But hey, you'd stink too if you spent three months buried in dirt.  Hey, why does it take more than one squirrel to change a light bulb?\nHarold: Why?\nSpongeBob: Because, they're so darn stupid!\nPatrick: That's a good one, huh, Sandy?\nSandy: Uhh, y-yeah...\nMr. Krabs: That was fantastic, boy. You really knocked them out! I think I'll do this joke night thing again with you as the head-liner!\nSpongeBob: I never thought I could be a head-liner! Whatever that is.\nMr. Krabs: The headliner's the one who cleans up after the show.\nSpongeBob: At least I don't have to clean up my act!\nMr. Krabs: Stick with the squirrel jokes, boy. Now get busy.\nSpongeBob: Mops, mops, mops, what's up with those things? I mean, really.  Oh, hey, Sandy!\nSandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Did you enjoy the show?\nSandy: Well, ac-actually, SpongeBob, n-no. Those jokes are hurtful and you know it.\nSpongeBob: Come on, Sandy, I was just joking. I mean, everybody knows that you're the smartest one in Bikini Bottom.\nSandy: Well, I can't argue with that.\nSpongeBob: We all gotta laugh at ourselves once in a while. I do it all the time!\nSandy: You're right, SpongeBob. I was being a little too sensitive.  No hard feelings.  Okay, deodorant. Huh, let's see. Roll-on or stick?\nFred: I think she should buy both.\nSandy: Huh?\nScooter: Hey, look, guys!  It's the stupid squirrel!\nLloyd: I know, let's try to communicate with it.\nAll: Duh...\nSandy: Hmph!  Hello, little critter! What's your name?\nMable: Don't stand too close to a squirrel, Billy. You'll catch it stupid.\nBilly: Okay, mom.\nSandy: Stupidity isn't a virus. But it sure is spreading like one.\nSpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la. Squirrely, squirrely, squirrely, squirrel. Because they're stupid. Because they're stupid.\nSandy: Hey, uhh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Oh, hi, Sandy.\nSandy: Umm, I need to talk to you about them squirrel jokes.\nSpongeBob: We already talked about that, remember?\nSandy: SpongeBob, this is serious. Since you've been telling them jokes, people have been treating me different.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, five minutes.  Hel-lo... Sandy. Me Patrick. Do you un-der-stand?  Squirrels.\nSandy: Y-y-you see? That's what I'm talking about!\nSpongeBob: Ah, that's just Patrick. He's just fooling around.\nSandy: I'm just asking you as a friend, please lay off them squirrel jokes, okay? Tell some of them other jokes you got.\nSpongeBob: Other jokes?  Bah! I got a million of them.\nSandy: Thanks, SpongeBob, I knew you'd understand.\nMr. Krabs: Put your fins together for SpongeBob SquarePants.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, hi.  Uhh, did you hear about the goldfish who went bankrupt? Now he's a bronze fish.  I guess you heard that one.\nSandy: I haven't heard it! Good one, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Thank you, you're too kind. Hey, what about this water! I mean, the stuff's everywhere.\nPatrick: Tell the one about the squirrel and the light bulbs.\nSpongeBob: Uhh...  Hey, what about this thing! Huh? Huh?\nFish #5: Get on with the squirrel jokes!\nSpongeBob: What do I do? Who do I do? SpongeBob, you've got a choice to make: your friends  or your career.\nSpongeBob: Howdy, y'all!  How come it takes more than one squirrel to screw in a light bulb?\nAll: Because they're so darn stupid!\nSpongeBob: My people!  But seriously folks, I want to give a special thanks to my friend, Sandy.  Sandy, don't you see? The crowd loves these jokes.  Am I right?  Don't you see, Sandy? We're laughing with you, not at you! Do you understand now, Sandy? Huh, do you?\nSandy: I understand everything that's going on, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Great. I knew sooner or later you'd get it. What a great sport.  Let's give a big hand for Sandy! But clap slow, because remember... She's a squirrel!  Thank you! You've been a wonderful audience, and uhh, good night!  Ah... another spectacular performance, SpongeBob.  Oh, what's this, a fan letter?\nSandy: You were right, SpongeBob! Those jokes are funny! Come on over to the Treedome tomorrow and celebrate, Sandy.\nSpongeBob: You did it, SpongeBob. You get to keep your career and your friends.  I'm glad that Sandy can finally see the genius of my comedy.  Good morning, Sandy.\nSandy: Well, hoooow-deeeeeee!\nSpongeBob: Sandy, are you feeling alright?\nSandy: I'm just being my own au-naturally squirrelly self!  Well, come on in! Y'all must be tired from telling them funny jokes all the time. Why don't you take a load off!\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy, I think something's wrong with this seat.\nSandy: Naw,  I just done put glue on it so you wouldn't fall off.  Are them flowers for me? You even done got me a vase!\nSpongeBob: But, Sandy, that, that's not a...\nSandy: Ain't that purdy?\nSpongeBob: Sandy, I need wa...\nSandy: Oh, that's right. Youse a sea critter. Now what was that thing that sea critters need? Umm, uhh... let's see, uhh...  Sea critters need, uhh...\nSpongeBob: Wa...\nSandy: Oh, wait, don't tell me. I know this one!\nSpongeBob: Wa...\nSandy: Wa...llet? Watch? Waffles?\nSpongeBob: Sandy! Water!\nSandy: Well, why didn't you just say so!  Here you go! Yup, us squirrels sure is stupid.\nSpongeBob: Sandy!\nSandy: Dumb, dumb, dumb, squirrels is dumb.\nSpongeBob: Sandy! Okay, Sandy, I get it!\nSandy: What's that? You want more?  Okey-dokey! More water for the sea-critter!\nSpongeBob: Okay, Sandy, okay! I get it!  No more squirrel jokes.  Thank you, thank you very much. Well, on my way over here, I ran into a squirrel.  And I said, 'Hey, why don't you go get a couple of squirrel friends and we'll go change a light bulb.'  But seriously folks, the only thing dumber than a squirrel is a sponge!  I mean, we're so dumb, we don't even have a vertebrae!  Look at me! I got no bones!\nFish #6: That's true.\nSpongeBob: Crabs? Oh, brother. They're so cheap, they can't even pay attention!\nMr. Krabs: It's true, I am cheap!\nSpongeBob: Now, let me tell you about those fish? Boy, are they smelly. Whoo-hoo! I mean how can a creature that spends so much time in the water smell so bad? I mean, really!  Soap... soap... what is... soap?  And don't even get me started on starfish!\n","32a\nPressure\nSandy: You know, SpongeBob, sometimes, it's nice to hang up my hang-glider and just watch the clouds roll by.\nSpongeBob: Yup, and just relax.\nSandy: Yeah. Relax.\nSpongeBob: Oooh! Oooh! Do you know what that cloud looks like?\nSandy: What?\nSpongeBob: A flower.\nSandy: They all look like flowers, SpongeBob. All the time.\nSpongeBob: They sure do.\nSandy: You know, normally, I'd offer to race you to the top of coral cliffs. But I don't want to miss out on a second of this beautiful beauty.\nSpongeBob: Me either. Who wants to get all dirty anyway?\nSandy: Yeah. And sweaty. Besides, I think we'd all know who'd get to the top first.\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\nSpongeBob and Sandy: Me.\nSpongeBob: That's funny, Sandy. That sounded like you said you could beat me at a climbing contest.\nSandy: Course I can! I'm a squirrel. See?\nSpongeBob: I thought that meant you were nuts.\nSandy: Nope, that means I'm a natural born climber. I'm from the surface world, and nothing prepares you for climbing than growing up on good ol' dry land.\nSpongeBob: Land-shmand, it's all about finger strength, baby, and if there's anything we've got plenty of down here, it's finger strength!  What do you think about that, \"Miss Mittens\"?\nSandy: I'd say I'm already halfway there!\nSpongeBob: Ahh!  Hey, no fair, Sandy! You got a head start!\nSandy: Sorry, SpongeBob, that's the way the coral crumbles!\nSpongeBob: Hey!  You did that on purpose!\nSandy: Yeah, but this is an accident!\nSpongeBob: Aaaaah!\nSandy: Too bad you forgot your umbrella!\nSpongeBob: I didn't!\nSandy: Well, it's about time you showed up.\nSpongeBob: I want a rematch! First one to the Krusty Krab is the winner!\nSandy: Ain't no way a sea critter can run faster than a land critter.\nSpongeBob: I can underwater! I'm...  Hydrodynamically designed!  Think you can win a fair race in that clunky tin tube?\nSandy: Why don't use ask my behind! That is, if you can catch it! What do you think of that, HydroPants?\nSpongeBob: I'd say I'm already halfway there!-halfway there!  -halfway there!-halfway there!.\nSandy: Hey!\nSandy: Thanks for the face lift!  You see, I told you that you didn't-\nSpongeBob: There you are! Ain't that just like a land creature to keep a sea creature  waiting!\nSandy: I thought y'all wanted a rematch.\nSpongeBob: I did! And I took a head start like you did!\nSandy: Well, I was just funning with you that time! But I guess all y'all underwater don't have to play fair!\nSpongeBob: I guess I don't, air breather!\nSandy: Water sucker!\nSpongeBob: Tree climber!\nSandy: Gulf streamer!\nSpongeBob: Kite flier!\nSandy: Chum chewer!\nSpongeBob: Take that back! You-  not wet person!\nSandy: Aha! You can't even come up with another name! That proves it!\nSpongeBob: Proves what?\nSandy: That land critters are better than sea critters!\nPatrick: Better at what?\nSandy Cheeks: Oh, dern near everything, I guess. Cattle roping and pie eating and wood chopping and flying!\nSquidward: What's she blabbering about?\nPatrick: She says land creatures are best.\nSandy: Only 'cause it's true! We're best at horse riding and fur stylin' and rowing. Y'all got us licked in swimming, but we've got corn shucking  and hay bailing and barn raising... and fishing!\nSandy: And name calling, for sure!\nSquidward: And drowning, don't forget drowning!\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squidward!  Woo!\nSquidward: Not on your life, sport.\nSpongeBob: I'll admit, you've got some pretty good moves. For a squirrel.  But you're still just a land creature.\nSandy: Squirrels can do anything they want to!\nPatrick: I bet they can't eat a Krabby Double Deluxe in one bite.  Ah.\nSandy: Give me that. They don't call me Cheeks for nothing.\nPatrick: Thank you, thank you.\nSandy: Well, there's just one thing.\nMr. Krabs: Can you do this?  Everyone in my family can do that.\nSandy: Uh...uh...\nSquidward: How about this?  Huh?\nSpongeBob: Can you reproduce by budding.  Can ya? Can ya? Can ya? Can ya?\nSandy: No!\nSpongeBob: Most importantly...can you do this?\nSandy: Well, what would I wanna do any of that dumb stuff for anyway?\nSpongeBob: Admit it, Sandy, you can't do anything us sea creatures can do. In fact, if wasn't for that suit, you couldn't live down here!\nSandy: Well, you know...  I don't need to...  Grr... I'll show ya all! I don't need this suit!  And I don't need this helmet neither!\nMr. Krabs: Neptune preserve her!\nSquidward: How long can she stay like that?\nSpongeBob: I don't know!\nPatrick: Sandy's a girl?\nSpongeBob: Wow, Sandy. You sure proved us wrong. I guess land creatures are better. At least until they need to breathe...  Yep, won't be long now.  Feelin' light-headed yet?\nSandy: Mm-mm.\nSpongeBob: Remember this?\nMr. Krabs: It's free!\nSandy: Stop laughing at me!\nMr. Krabs: I knew it! There was no way some \"airhead\" was gonna win anything against a water breather!\nPatrick: Airhead...  Huh?\nSpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Sea creatures rule! Water! Water! Water!\nSandy: All right, all right! You had your little laugh. But now it's my turn! Y'all think you're such hot stuff, don't ya?! Swimming around with your fancy gills and such. But none of you wetheads could last a minute on my turf. Dry land!\nSquidward: Do we have to wear pickle jars?\nSandy: Nope, nothing but the clothes on your backs.\nSpongeBob: One minute? No problem, Landy!\nSandy: Well? So are you going or not?\nSpongeBob: Actually, you know, but...\nSquidward: We can't, uh...because...\nMr. Krabs: Well, um... we're late for our...\nPatrick: Our fitting!\nSandy: Oh, you mean for your chicken costumes!\nPatrick: Hey! We are not chicken!  Huh! My popcorn!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we're not chicken, we'll do it.  There. Mission accomplished.\nSandy: Look. Unless you can stay above water for one measly minute, you forfeit the contest and prove that land creatures are better than sea creatures!\nSpongeBob: No, way, San-day. We can take on your challenge!\nPatrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Where not afraid of your dumb old land!\nPatrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: We're sea creatures!\nSpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Okay... Well, this is it.\nMr. Krabs: Wait, boy!  Make it last.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs. Okay! Here I go!  Hey, this isn't so bad. We can do this! Hey, Patrick, come on up! The air is fine!\nPatrick: I'm gonna do it quick and get it over with. Cannonball!  Hey, I lost my trunks! Hi, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: All right, Pat, you made it! Come on, Mr. Krabs! Up here!\nMr. Krabs: All ashore, that's going to shore, Mr. Squidward! Land ho!\nSpongeBob: Looking good, Mr. Krabs!\nPatrick: Yeah! Yeah! Woohoo!\nSpongeBob: Come on, Squidward, you're missing all the dry. Come on, Squidward!\nSpongeBob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! Squidward!\nSquidward: Well, I'll do it. But I won't like it.  ...What?\nSpongeBob: Well, here we are. '\nSquidward: This is pretty easy.\nPatrick: I may keep a second rock up here.\nMr. Krabs: Once you get your land legs, it's not so bad!\nSpongeBob: We're the masters of land and sea!\nSpongeBob: Hey, it\u2019s local. Hi, we're from underwater. Do you know Sandy Cheeks?\nSandy: 3, 2, 1. Well, tan my fur. They made it! Better congratulate them.  SpongeBob! Patrick? Hmm, where'd those critters get to?  Holy guacamole! You can't eat my friends, you rats with wings! Hiyah!\nSpongeBob: Uh, thanks for saving us, Sandy.\nSandy: You know, everyone's best at something.\nSpongeBob: But no one's best at everything. Sorry I made you take off your helmet, Sandy.\nSandy: Sorry I made you go up on dry land, SpongeBob.\nMr. Krabs: Three cheers for feeling sorry for ourselves! Hip hip!\nAll: Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: Hip hip!\nAll: Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: Hip hip!\nSeagulls: Hooray.\n","32b\nThe Smoking Peanut\nNarrator: Ah... the Bikini Bottom Zoo is having its annual Free Day. Free balloons...\nNarrator: Free drinks...\nNarrator: Free light bulbs?\nMr. Krabs: Aha! Top of the mornin', boys!  Whew! Next stop: gift shop.\nSpongeBob: There it is... Oyster Stadium. Not only do they have the largest oyster held in captivity, it also does tricks!\nSpongeBob: He spits a giant pearl 100 feet in the air, like a cannonball!\nPatrick: Why are we hanging around watching a cheap imitation? Let's get over there!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: This is the greatest day of our lives!\nPatrick: This is the greatest day of our lives? Boring.\nSpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. We came to see  pearls 100 feet in the air!  Right? I'll try my oyster call.\nPatrick: Well, I'm outta here. Thanks for nothin', SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Come on, come on, wake up already!  I think it's working!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, it's waking up!\nPatrick: Oh, boy, did I miss it?\nSpongeBob: No, the show's about to begin!\nZoo Worker #1: What's wrong with Clamu?\nJoe: Easy, girl! It's me, Joe! Remember?\nPatrick: Now, this is a show!\nAnnouncer: Attention, zoo patrons! Clamu, the giant oyster is on an emotional rampage! Please scream and run around in circles.  Thanks for coming.\nZoo Worker #1: You boys better get out of this area, pronto! There's nothing more dangerous than an emotionally disturbed oyster.  You didn't do anything that might have caused this horrible tragedy, did you?\nSpongeBob: Uh...\nPatrick: No way! Only a jerk would upset a gentle giant. Right, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Right.\nPatrick: Man, if I ever see the guy who upset Clamu, I'd have a few choice words for him, like \"you\"... and... \"are\" ... and... \"a jerk!\"  Are you sure you didn't see anything suspicious?\nSpongeBob: I already said I didn't, Patrick, sheesh!\nPatrick: Hey, let's investigate this crime and catch the lowlife who's responsible!\nSpongeBob: Give it a rest, Patrick! There's no crime to investigate! Now go home!  Stupid Patrick... I didn't do anything wrong! Aw, what am I getting so worked up about? I'm sure that by tomorrow, this whole ugly mess will be a funny memory.\nJohnny: Our top story tonight: giant oyster has its feelings hurt! The only clue that could be found was this lone peanut! And as you can hear, the oyster continues to emit its horrible cry. A cry so powerful, it can be heard around the world.  A cry that not only breaks the sound barrier, it breaks the hearts of our citizens!  What kind of cruel, careless, evil person would deliberately upset one of Neptune's most gentle creatures?\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: No, Gary! How would I know anything about the oyster?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Defensive? I'm not being defensive! Barnacles! What is this, 20 Questions or something?  This is getting a little out of hand. All I did was throw a peanut. I didn't mean to make the oyster cry! I just wanted to see it perform spectacular stunts! Aw, everyone's gonna hate me! I-I need some advice! Now, let's see now. Who could never hate me no matter what I do?  Squidward! Squidward! Oh, Squidward!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! Do you have to knock so loudly?\nSpongeBob: Sorry, neighbor.\nSquidward: Oh... that overgrown clam is giving me a headache! I can't even take my afternoon beauty nap!\nSpongeBob: Funny thing you should mention that old oyster, because I... uh... was kind of wondering, um... Let's say I know this guy who may have something to do with the oyster.\nSquidward: You mean you know the guy who did it?!\nSquidward: Oh, this is great! You and I can go turn him in! And then I'll get so much sleep, I'll be gorgeous!\nSpongeBob: Um, actually, I-I'm just talking hypothetically.\nSquidward: You mean you don't know who did it?\nSpongeBob: Well, um... I... uh... no.  Squidward?\nPatrick: Gotcha!\nPatrick: Where were you on the day of today? Don't play games with me, mister!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?\nPatrick: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. I'm just continuing my investigation of the Great Clamu Caper!\nSpongeBob: Um... have you found out anything?\nPatrick: Yes! No, wait, uh... no.  But this grain of sand looks pretty suspicious, and so does this rock!  And I've got a few questions for this little piece of grass! Don't worry, SpongeBob! Patrick's on the case! The truth will be revealed!\nSpongeBob: I better go see Sandy, she'll know what to do!\nSandy: Oh, I can't stand it anymore! That poor, poor critter! What kind of inconsiderate person would upset such a gentle creature?\nSpongeBob: Uh, that's kind of what I wanted to talk about, Sandy.\nSandy: Why, when I find out who caused that oyster so much pain, no more jiggery pokery!\nSandy: Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, SpongeBob?\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob, how come you're all twitchy like that?\nSpongeBob: Twitchy? Twitchy? Who's twitchy? I'm not twitchy! Sorry, Sandy, I have to, um... um... go get my hair cut.\nSandy: SpongeBob doesn't have hair... or does he?\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob!  This is it! All of the clues are coming together. I followed these footprints right to this exact spot, and then, right where you're standing, I found this bag of peanuts! Ha! Oh, I'm so close to solving this crime, I can almost taste it!  Boy, crime fighting sure makes me hungry, and this yellow Popsicle hits the spot!\nSpongeBob: Okay, uh, good luck with all that, Patrick, and, uh, I guess I'll see you later!\nPolice Fish #1: Open up! This is the police!\nSpongeBob: Uh, uh, just a second!\nPolicefish #1: Are you SpongeBob SquarePants?\nSpongeBob: Y-y-yes?\nPolicefish #1: Put those eyeballs back in your head, son. We've got a few questions for you.\nPolicefish #1: Were you at the zoo on the day of the oyster incident?\nSpongeBob: Y-yes!\nPolicefish #1: Did you, or did you not take part in various activities of zoo-time merriment?\nSpongeBob: Yes...\nPolicefish #1: And are you familiar with... this peanut?\nSpongeBob: Yes!\nPolicefish #1: Just one more question... Is it true that you were at the oyster's lair with a Mr. Patrick Star?\nSpongeBob: Yes! Yes! It's true! It's true! It's all true! The merriment, the peanut, the Patrick!\nPolicefish #1: That's all we need to know, son. Let's book 'im!\nPatrick: Wow, you guys are good! I'm the last person I would have suspected, but I was looking for me all the time! It's the perfect crime!\nPolicefish #1: Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge, pinky!\nSpongeBob: Oh, no! Patrick's too sensitive for the big house!  Wait! Stop! I'm the one you want! I am the criminal!\nSandals: Hey, everybody, let's throw peanuts at him and see how he likes it!\nPatrick: I get what I deserve!  Ouch.\nSpongeBob: Wait! Hold your peanuts! Patrick Star is innocent! I have come here to reveal the truth! They say that truth and honesty will be rewarded with trust and forgiveness!\nPatrick: Dum, dum, dum dum, de, dum...\nSpongeBob: I'm here to lay my cards on the table, to trim the branches of deception from the tree of life, to shave away the unkempt sideburns from the face of truth! I...\nSandals: Hey! Just get on with it!\nSpongeBob: I am the one who threw the peanut! I know now that what I have done is wrong. And so I say, I am sorry, giant performing oyster. I am sorry, Patrick. I am sorry, citizens of Bikini Bottom.\nSandals: Hey! Let's throw peanuts at both of them!\nZoo Worker #1: Wait! Here's the real criminal!\nMr. Krabs: Uh, top of the mornin'!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nPatrick: I knew it!\nZoo Worker #1: Mr. Krabs has stolen a very important item from the oyster.  Behold!  Wait a minute...  Behold! The oyster's pearl!  Here you go, girl.\nBaby Oyster: Mama! Mama!\nSpongeBob: Mother of pearl! The oyster's a mother! And that pearl's no pearl, it's an egg!\nBaby Oyster: Mama!\nClamu: Aww!\nAll: Awww...\nMr. Krabs: But it's... Free Day!\n","33a\nShanghaied\nNarrator: Ahoy, kids. It's time for SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special!\nPirates: Hooray!\nNarrator: And now the host of You Wish. He's got puffy and better loons than Captain Kidd, and fuzzier facial hair than Black Beard. He's America's favorite Pirate, Patchy of Encino!\nPatchy: Ahoy, fellow fanatics! Welcome to me quarters. Why don't come on back on the galley, I'm cooking up a little treat for you today. It's call-in-and-vote time. You get to choose how our cartoon ends today, via the phone, or the Internet if your technologically inclined. Now this cartoon is different from most cartoons in that-\nPotty: Bawk! In what way?\nPatchy: Well, If it isn't my less-than-amusing sidekick, Potty the Parrot. Potty, say hello to the nice people.\nPotty: Help! I'm being held here against my will-- Help!\nPatchy: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh...  Oh, Potty come back! Potty? Potty? Were'd you go?  Potty, you in here, buddy?\nPotty: Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.\nPatchy: Get me out of here, you scurvy bird!  Now, what was I saying? Now this cartoon ain't like most of your \"land-lobbing cartoons\". This cartoon has not one, not two, but three different endings! So, when I tell you to call the number their that's scrolling at the bottom of the screen...  No, not now! Don't call 'till I tell you to! Roll the cartoon! Now, remember to vote at the end because-  Your not gonna make this easy are ya. Quiet! Vast their! Be laze that ringing! Stop! Its driving me mad!\nSpongeBob: Mmm, Kelp-O! With one of eight essential prizes inside!  Holy shrimp!  Squidward! The sky had a baby from my cereal box! Squidward!  Squidward! The sky had a baby!\nSquidward: That's not a baby! That's a giant anchor! Now go away!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob! The sky had a baby!\nSpongeBob: I know! What do you think we should name it?\nPatrick: How about...\nSquidward: Why don't you two go climb its anchor rope? I'm sure it goes somewhere far away!  Now look what you've done!\nSpongeBob: We didn't do it, Squidward. Our hands are clean!\nPatrick: Clean...\nSquidward: Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing.\nSpongeBob: Wouldn't that be the top?\nSpongeBob: Squid, wait! Wait!\nPatrick: Squidward!\nNarrator: A few inches later...\nSpongeBob: Ship!\nPatrick: SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?\nSpongeBob: No, look, a giant ship!\nSquidward: Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.\nSquidward: That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.\nSpongeBob: Squid, wait!\nSquidward: All right, who owns this crate?  Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!\nSpongeBob: Doesn't this place seem familiar?\nPatrick: I don't know. Why?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?\nPatrick: Yes!\nSpongeBob: I know who owns this boat but I just can't place the name.\nFlying Dutchman: Rawr!\nSpongeBob: No, no, it's not \"rawr!\"\nFlying Dutchman: I am the Flying Dutchman!\nSpongeBob: That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!\nFlying Dutchman: Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman in his own lair?\nSpongeBob: It's Squidward. He wants to complain to you.\nSquidward: I...no, I don't.\nSpongeBob: Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?\nSquidward: I never said that.\nFlying Dutchman: Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!\nSpongeBob: No, no, wait, it was his mother you said was dirty, not his ship.\nSquidward: Ow.\nFlying Dutchman: You're next!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: That was a close one!\nFlying Dutchman: Welcome back!\nSpongeBob: That was a closer one!\nFlying Dutchman: Welcome back!\nSquidward: Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's...\nFlying Dutchman: So, are you gonna try that again?\nPatrick: Probably.\nFlying Dutchman: How 'bout now?\nPatrick: Uhh...\nSquidward: No, no, they're not. Whew.\nFlying Dutchman: Now listen.  Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever!  And, uhh , ever.\nSquidward: Will we be getting business cards?\nFlying Dutchman: Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind- numbing, and repetitive. Just like...daytime television.\nSquidward: Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting!  Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea...  Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me...  Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind of magic act?\nFlying Dutchman: Would anyone else like to enter the \"Fly of Despair\"?\nSpongeBob: No! We know our place now, Mister Dutchman.\nPatrick: We'll do anything you say!\nFlying Dutchman: Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck!\nSpongeBob: Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!\nPatrick: And I got this hat!\nFlying Dutchman: Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!\nSpongeBob: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably...\nPatrick: No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.\nSpongeBob: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!\nPatrick: I don't get it.\nSpongeBob: Look, it's easy, it simply means that...\nFlying Dutchman: Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.\nSpongeBob: So, you don't want it to look good?\nFlying Dutchman: Get moving!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!\nFlying Dutchman: What a night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear!\nPatrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!\nPatrick: Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee!  Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!  Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!\nFlying Dutchman: Eh, that'll do. Okay, Square One, since Pink One's working the navigation, it's up to you to find our first victim. Here, use this spyglass. Now hurry up! We're burnin' moonlight!\nSpongeBob: Let's see who we can find.  Captain, there's a guy we can scare.\nBilly: I had four biscuits, and I ate one. Then I only had three.\nFlying Dutchman: Ahh, it does me heart good to see children out after dark. Pink One, take us behind those rocks.\nPatrick: Moving behind the rocks!\nSpongeBob: Keep going. You're good. You're good. You're good...and...stop. Don't worry, Cap'n, we'll buff out those scratches.\nFlying Dutchman: All right, never mind it. Just jump out when I give the signal.\nFlying Dutchman: Boo! Prepare to be burdened with the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!\nSpongeBob: Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just...just do it again.\nFlying Dutchman: With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!\nPatrick: How does he do that?\nFlying Dutchman: Get back on the ship.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: It's still a mystery!\nBilly: Those guys are dorks.\nFlying Dutchman: Yes, but they're my dorks.\nSpongeBob: You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good. You're good. You're good.  You're good.. You're good. You're good.  Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?\nPatrick: Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!\nSpongeBob: Like movie passes?\nPatrick: Or an oversized coffee mug?!\nFlying Dutchman: I've been thinking. Stop bouncing!  This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.\nSpongeBob: You're setting us free?\nFlying Dutchman: Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner!\nPatrick: Wait, I have an idea!\nSpongeBob: Really?! What is it?\nPatrick: Let's leave!\nSpongeBob: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the...perfume department.\nPatrick: Let's do it.\nSpongeBob: I always hate going in there!\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: Wait! Listen!\nFlying Dutchman: Dear Diary: I told them I'm going to eat them tomorrow. I made up some of that brown sauce my cousin showed me just for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my dining sock again. Remember the last time I lost me dining sock, I couldn't eat for a whole week. Yes, sir, sometimes I wonder how I'd survive if anything should ever happen...  Give me back my sock! Everyone knows I can't eat without it!\nSpongeBob: Never!\nFlying Dutchman: Okay, then...  Give it to me!\nSpongeBob: No!\nFlying Dutchman: Wait, you're stretching out the elastic!\nPatrick: It would seem we have reached an impasse.\nFlying Dutchman: Pink one is right. Tell you what. You give me back the sock, and I'll give you...three wishes.\nPatrick: Make it five.\nFlying Dutchman: Four.\nPatrick: Three. Take it or leave it.\nFlying Dutchman: Okay...uhh, three. You get three wishes.\nSpongeBob: Wow! Three wishes, Pat. Isn't that great?\nPatrick: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!\nFlying Dutchman: Okay, you got two wishes left.\nSpongeBob: Well, we still have two more. How exciting! I wish Squidward were here to see this!\nSquidward: Boy, I'm glad all that's over!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! You're back!\nSpongeBob: Guess what? The Dutchman gave us three wishes! Patrick used the first one, and I guess I...  just used the second one.\nSquidward: Well, then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!\nPatrick: Wait! I think it belongs to me!  Because I didn't really get a real wish, so why should you get a wish...\nSpongeBob: Well, that's not right because...\nFlying Dutchman: That's enough! Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish.  Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and...\nVoting Guy: All hands! All hands! Time to vote! It's voting time!\nPatchy: Well, that's our cartoon so far. Now its time for you to decide how it ends! Who will get the last wish? Will it be, Sassy Squidward, Porky Patrick, or Good 'Ol SpongeBob.  My trusty crew, is eagerly awaiting your call. So, hoist your anchor of that couch, and make with the voting! This is your big chance, And we'll be right back to announce, the winner!  Ahoy children, I'm back! I hope all you boys and girls got your votes in, because it\u2019s time for you to walk the plank!  Oh, sorry, kids. What I meant to say because it's time to announce the winner!  But first, let's look at the endings you didn't choose. According to our high tech counter ology, You didn't choose, Patrick.  But, let's see what Patrick would've wished for if you picked him. OK! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the tape! Roll the- oh gaw!\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\nSpongeBob: That's you, Patrick. Make your wish.\nPatrick: Uhh...\nSquidward: Wait, Patrick, listen. I do not particularly feel like being trapped here for all eternity. Eternity is a very long time...  Understand?!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you've got to think harder than you've ever thought before.\nPatrick: Uhh...\nSpongeBob: That's not gonna do it! Think harder!\nPatrick: Uhh...\nSquidward and SpongeBob: Come on! Come on, Patrick! Yeah! Put on your thinking cap!\nPatrick: Uhh...  Okay! I've got it.\nFlying Dutchman: Thou wish is granted.\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry. Want some gum?\nSquidward: You wished for gum?\nPatrick: Well, if we're gonna be here forever, we might as well have fresh breath!\nSpongeBob: Come on, mister, let us out! Don't be so mean! Don't be so fatty!\nPatrick: Aaaah! Let us out!\nFlying Dutchman: Ahh, minty.\nPatchy: Heh heh heh. That Patrick shivers me timbers right down to my peg leg! Ha! ha! ha! You were right not to pick that one kids! Seemed like a lot of nonsense to me! Molarchy! Oh well, let's take a look at the other loser! Heh heh heh!  It appears you didn't vote for Squidward! I don't blame you, I wouldn't have either. But, let's see what would happen if the Old Dutchman's Eeny-Minie-Mo finger landed on Squidward!\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you get a wish! A great big wish!\nSquidward: That's right! And you know what I wish?\nPatrick: No!\nSquidward: I wish that I had never met you two barnacle-heads before in my entire life!\nFlying Dutchman: So be it.\nSpongeBob: Hi there, I don't believe we've met. My name is SpongeBob, and this is my associate Patrick.\nPatrick: Hi.\nSquidward: That's not what I meant!\nFlying Dutchman: Well, now that introductions are out of the way, it's time for dinner!\nSpongeBob: And what did you say your name was?\nSquidward: I'm Squidward. I'm your neighbor.\nSpongeBob: Oh, nice to meet you, Squid-ward.  We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other, I guess.\nPatchy: And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, So get ready to blow milk out of your nose because its time to announce, the winner! The envelope please, Potty. Thank you, my fine feathered assistant. Well, what do you know? The winner is, SpongeBob!  Hey, Potty, do you smell something? Oh, Potty! That fuse in your head! I told you we're not doing that stunt!\nPotty: Brawk, I didn't get the memo! Brawk!\nPatchy: And now, the most requested ending! Hooray!\nFlying Dutchman: You are it!\nSquidward: Now, think, SpongeBob! We're about to get eaten. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get eaten?\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I've got it all figured out. He won't be able to eat us because...I wish the Dutchman was a vegetarian!\nSpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward: Hooray!\nSpongeBob: We're home!\nPatrick: You did it, SpongeBob. We're saved!\nSquidward: But why have we been turned into fruits?\nFlying Dutchman: Hey, I get a wish, too. Fruit prevents scurvy!  Hey, get back here with that!\nPatchy: Hold on! Sorry about that, kids! It\u2019s just that old Patchy can't help but get all choked up at the end of a show. But the good news is, when you watch this cartoon land-lobbing style like you usually do, it'll have the ending you picked, so now your an official big time cartoon decision maker!  Just don't let it go to your head! Well, say good night to the folks, Potty! Potty!\nPotty: Sqwuak! I quit! I quit!\nPatchy: Ohhh! Oh, that's it, folks! Right now, I got a little employee management to take care of! Oh, Potty! Potty, get in your nice cage! Potty, I'm not kidding!\nNarrator: And so, we conclude SpongeBob's You Wish Spectacular Special! Thanks for voting!\nPatchy: OW!\n","33b\nGary Takes a Bath\nSpongeBob: Gary! Looks like it's that time of week again: bath time.  Come on, let's go get the water started. You're gonna have to get in that tub, Gary. Now, Gary, we can do this the hard way, or the easy way, or the medium way,  or the semi-medium-easy-hard way, or the sorta hard with a touch of awkward-easy-difficulty-challenging way...  So that's how you wanna play it, huh?\nSpongeBob: Gary! Check out this new toy. Fetch!  Huh? \"New\" Boomerang Pet Ball: Really Works! Hmmm.\nSpongeBob: Gary! There's a bomb strapped to my chest! It's gonna explode in 3 seconds unless you take a bath!...  ...Please...  ... I am now going to assault your mind with subliminal messages.\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry you had to see that.  Hello, Fancy French Restaurant? I've got a naughty snail here who won't take a bath.  What? Can you say that again? Slow down, it's like you're speaking some other language!  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog? Weehee! Okay, your turn.  Hey, Gare! How 'bout some leap frog?  ... I've got a crisp dollar bill for the next fella to take a bath in this house!  Ya-da-da-da...  That didn't work either, huh?  Gary! Gary! Look what I found! It's an old, pirate treasure map revealing a location of buried pirate treasure in this very house. Come on, boy, let's go get that treasure. Whoo! Okay, Gary, now 40 paces to the left. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 24, 25, 26, twenty seveeen...  40. The treasure must be in here!  Wow, Gary, look! A pirate treasure chest.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Why, no, Gary, this isn't the bathtub.  It's treasure. Look, doubloons.  Don't drop 'em... Look at this brooch!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I don't know what a snail would want with a brooch! Now why don't you just get into the tub?!  Get in the tub!  Get in the tub!!  Get in the tub...  In the tub.  In the tub!  Now, Gary, are you gonna get in this tub or am I gonna have to...  Gary, could you...  Gary, no!  Gary! . Alright, Gary, you have duped, and/or, frustrated me for the last time. So, if I can't get you to come to the bath, I'll just have to bring the bath to you. . Psst, Gary. Bath delivery. . Come back, Gary. I have something to \"chair\" with you.  \"Dishes\" more like it. \"Water\" you waiting for, Gary?\nSpongeBob: Aww, stuck in a tree? It's time to clean up your act, Gary. . Oh, no! I bathed Gary too hard and removed his skin.  Gary! Bring that ladder back this instant.  I am really not amused, mister. You are going to take a bath, and you are going to get clean right now.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I am so the boss of you!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: It may be a free country, but you live in my house under my rules.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Don't use that tone of voice with me. You will do what I say when I say.  What are you doing? I am talking to you, mister.  Do not go near that mud puddle! Gary, the snail, do you hear me? I am giving you three seconds to get away from that mud puddle. One,  two,  two and a half...  don't make me say three!  Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary!!  I'm a dirty boy.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, Gary.  I'm getting behind my ears.\n","34a\nWelcome to the Chum Bucket\nMr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob! It's quittin' time!  I've got a card game tonight.\nSpongeBob: Who're you playing cards with, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I'm going over to the Chum Bucket to play with Plankton.\nSpongeBob: Plankton?!  But, Mr. Krabs, he's your arch-enemy!  He's been trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula for years!\nPlankton: Ouch.\nSpongeBob: Why would you play cards with him?\nMr. Krabs: Between you and me, Plankton is the worst card player in Bikini Bottom!  Why, I've been taking him to the cleaners every Thursday night for fifteen years!  I never lose!\nSpongeBob: Taking him to the cleaners! That's a hot one!  How'd the card game go last night, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I lost.\nSpongeBob: Barnacles, Mr. Krabs. How much money did you lose?\nMr. Krabs: I didn't lose any money.  I lost...\nSpongeBob: Don't tell me you lost the Krusty Krab!\nMr. Krabs: I lost...\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please tell me you didn't lose the Krabby Patty secret formula!\nMr. Krabs: I lost...  you!\nSpongeBob: What?\nMr. Krabs: I bet your contract and I lost.\nSpongeBob: Good one, Mr. Krabs. Well, I got to go make those Krabby Patties.\nMr. Krabs: I'm afraid you don't work here anymore.\nSquidward: Please tell me this isn't a joke.\nSpongeBob: Go on, Mr. Krabs. Tell him. Tell him all about your cruel, sick joke.\nPlankton: As much as I love cruel, sick jokes, I'm afraid he's not joking.  You work for me now, SpongeBob.  Time to put on the official Chum Bucket bucket helmet.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I don't wanna work for him!  I wanna work for you here at the Krusty Krab!\nMr. Krabs: I'm sorry, boy! It's all my fault!\nPlankton: What kind of cold, heartless person would break apart such a loving relationship?  I would!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nPlankton: This is your greatest blunder, Krabs. For 15 years, I've been throwing those card games just waiting for you to slip up. I may not have the precious Krabby Patty formula, but I've got the next best thing: the guy who makes 'em!  I'm gonna run you out of business, Krabs!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  Can I have my arms back?\nSpongeBob: What is this place?\nPlankton: Okay, I'm ready for my Krabby Patty!\nSpongeBob: Actually, uh, Mr. Plankton, sir, I haven't, uh...\nPlankton: Perhaps you don't understand. You work for me now  and as your new boss, I command you to make me a patty this instant, or I'll be forced to remove your brain and implant it in my robot chef!  So get cooking.\nSpongeBob: The sign says \"kitchen\", but my heart says \"jail\". \u266aA stove is a stove, no matter where you go.\u266a\nMr. Krabs: \u266aA patty is a patty, that's what I say.\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aA grill is a grill, this is surely so,\u266a\nMr. Krabs: \u266aAnd fries should be fries, either way.\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aBut this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know.\u266a\nMr. Krabs: \u266aI would trade it all away, if you'd come back to stay.\u266a\nUnison: \u266aThis kitchen's not the same without you.\u266a\nMr. Krabs: \u266aIt's just a greasy spoon\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aIt's just a greasy spoon...\u266a\nUnison: \u266a...without you.\u266a\nPlankton: What is he doing? All these tears... and the showtunes... Why isn't he making the patties? Forget it. I'm going with plan B, I'll put his brain in the robot chef.\nKaren: You know that never works! The answer is obvious: to get to the SpongeBob, you must show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give you what you want.\nPlankton: Will you be quiet? I'm thinking! I've got it! To get to the SpongeBob, I'll show him compassion and understanding, then he'll give me what I want.\nPlankton: Hi!\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Plankton, I've tried my best. I'm not used to cooking this way! Please don't take my brain out!\nPlankton: Hold it, SpongeBob, I'm capable of compassion and understanding.\nSpongeBob: Really?! Then I would like to go back to the Krusty Krab.\nPlankton: Let's not get carried away. Now what can I do to make you more comfortable here at the Chum Bucket?\nSpongeBob: Well, I usually cook on a grill.\nPlankton: You got it!  Well, it wasn't easy, but here it is! One old frying grill. How about we try it out?\nSpongeBob: Uh, it's just that I'm used to the grill facing that way.\nPlankton: Say no more, I'll take care of everything.  How about here?\nSpongeBob: A little more to the left.\nPlankton: How's this, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Move it over a little more.\nPlankton: Here?\nSpongeBob: Keep going.\nPlankton: Here?\nSpongeBob: Almost! That's it, just a little more...perfect! Right there! I don't know, it still doesn't feel right.\nPlankton: Just a few more steps, SpongeBob. Okay, go ahead, take it off!  It's an exact replica of the Krusty Krab kitchen!\nSpongeBob: It is an exact replica! Here's the sink, the greasy fryers, the squeaky floorboards, and that thing! One Krabby Patty coming up, Mr. Krabs!  Oh...Mr. Krabs!\nPlankton: Don't cry, SpongeBob! I'll show you it's much better working for me! Is there anything that old skinflint Krabs wouldn't let you have?\nSpongeBob: Well...there is one thing I've always wanted...  Wow!\nPlankton: So now do you have everything you need to make some Krabby Patties?\nSpongeBob: Well...\nPlankton: You ready to make some patties?\nSpongeBob: Wait \u2018til I finish my ice cream!\nPlankton: How about those patties?\nSpongeBob: Faster! Faster! Faster!\nPlankton: And then the littlest sea-elf said...  Huh? Steady, Plankton! It's all gonna pay off soon enough. Hey there, sleepy head, what do you say?\nSpongeBob: All this preparation is making me hungry.\nPlankton: Me too. You know what would really hit the spot? Why don't you whip us up a couple of Krabby Patties?\nSpongeBob: Mmmm...I'm kind of in the mood for tacos.\nPlankton: Good one, SpongeBob. But really, why don't you go ahead and make us a patty?\nSpongeBob: No, I don't really feel like it!\nPlankton: But I don't understand.  You have the grill, and the spatula, and the comfy chair.  I rubbed your putrid feet!\nSpongeBob: Tell you what, half-pint: why don't you ask me later!\nPlankton: I command you to make me a patty this instant!\nSpongeBob: No!\nPlankton: Don't back sass me!\nSpongeBob: Do ba da ma!\nPlankton: What?!  That's it, mister! You just lost your brain privileges.  Finished! SpongeBob, come in here! Or should I say RobotBob Sponge...Chef...Pants...  I put the brain in the robot, you know.  You shouldn't have been a spoiled brat. You see, I always get what I want. And I want you to make me a Krabby Patty!\nSpongeBob: Dee dee doodle dee dee doo. Response: Why don't you ask me later?\nPlankton: What? What?!\nSpongeBob: Get welded.\nPlankton: Wait! I command you make me a Krabby Patty!\nSpongeBob: I don't wanna.\nMr. Krabs: Well, old girl, this looks like our final chapter.  Huh?\nPlankton: I can't take anymore. You've gotta take that yellow nightmare back! It's not worth it. I'm better off stealing a Krabby Patty fair and square.\nMr. Krabs: Um...Well...  a deal's a deal, Plankton. He's your headache now.\nPlankton: Oh, please, have mercy, Krabs! I'll do anything! I beg of you!\nMr. Krabs: How 'bout... you give me fifty bucks, and I'll take him off your hands.\nPlankton: It's a deal! I cheated anyway.\nMr. Krabs: Now, be gone with you, you puny pest!\nPlankton: Thank you!  Ouch.\nSpongeBob: My brain and I are glad to be back, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Glad to have you back, lad. Now get to those patties! The lunch rush is a-comin'!\nSpongeBob: I don't feel like it! Why don't you ask me later, Krabby?  I mean...I'll work all day for free! My treat!\nMr. Krabs: That's what I thought you said.\n","34b\nFrankendoodle\nFrench Narrator: Well, well, what is this? Ah, the artist at sea. Let us watch and see the fruits of his struggle. Ah, it seems that inspiration has struck.\nArtist: Hmm... ah!\nArtist: My pencil!  What? No, no!\nFrench Narrator: The artist has learned the first lesson of the sea: Always bring a spare pencil.\nArtist: Noooooo!\nSpongeBob: Okay. Ready, Patrick? One...\nPatrick: Two...\nBoth: Three!\nSpongeBob: Scissors beats paper, Patrick!  One...\nBoth: two...\nSpongeBob: Three!  Patrick, how come you always do paper?\nPatrick: What is that thing, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: It looks like a giant pencil.\nPatrick: Go touch it.\nSpongeBob: It is a giant pencil, Patrick!  Let's draw some giant pictures with it.\nPatrick: Whatcha drawin'?\nSpongeBob: Stand back, Patrick! I can't draw with you breathing down my neck!\nPatrick: Psh, artists.\nSpongeBob: It's a jellyfish.\nPatrick: Pretty good, SpongeBob! But it's lacking basic construction, and your perspective leaves a lot to be desired.\nSpongeBob: Eh, everybody's a critic.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, your drawing's coming to life!\nSpongeBob: Now that's more like it, Mr. Critic!\nPatrick: No, I mean it's swimming away!\nSpongeBob: Do you know what this means, Patrick?\nPatrick: Your art can never hang in a museum.\nSpongeBob: It means we found a magic pencil!\nPatrick: Now all I need is a magic mustache and all my dreams will have come true.\nSpongeBob: Coming right up!\nPatrick: Life is good!  Easy come, easy go.\nSquidward: Squidward, if you had some hair, you'd be the most gorgeous creature in the sea! You've got looks... talent... all you need is a full head of...  hair!\nPatrick: My turn!\nSpongeBob: Be careful, Patrick! Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such.\nPatrick: Come on! I was just gonna draw a cartoon.\nSpongeBob: Okay! Why didn't you say so?\nSpongeBob: Hey! Another jellyfish!\nPatrick: It's Squidward, silly!\nSpongeBob: It's kind of creepy looking when it moves.\nPatrick: You're right, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: We can't let it go into town!\nPatrick: Poor Squidward.\nSpongeBob: Hey! My brain just hatched an idea.  This is gonna be classic!\nSquidward: I think I fancy a stroll around the park.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward!\nSquidward: What do you want? Hello, what's this? Someone left me money for a perm. Come to Hairy!  Ow! SpongeBob! Oh, my hair!  SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Wait! I've got another idea! This'll be the ultimate prank. I'll draw me, and when Squidward answers the door... it won't be me!  Aww, look at him. Ain't he a doll? All he needs is a tie.  Ready for action!\nPatrick: He's going to the door.\nSpongeBob: He's knocking on the door. Squidward's answering the door and...\nSquidward: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\nPatrick: He's beating up Squidward! Ha! Ha! Ha!\nSpongeBob: DoodleBoy, stop!\nPatrick: He's got the pencil.\nSpongeBob: What have I done? We've got to find him!\nSpongeBob: Where could he possibly be?\nPatrick: Maybe he's in that poorly drawn pineapple.\nSpongeBob: Come on, let's go!\nPatrick: I'm not going in there\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. I'm right behind you. Baby steps. Almost there...\nPatrick: What just happened?\nDoodleBob: Meahoy, memoyay? Meyoyyoy, ladyonmamoy!\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Give me a boost up!\nPatrick: Can't we just stay down here where it's safe?\nSpongeBob: No way. I created this monster and I've got to stop him.\nDoodleBob: Neofineyin!\nSpongeBob: See what I mean, Patrick?\nPatrick: Where's the leak, ma'am?  Yurrgh!\nSpongeBob: You okay, Patrick?\nPatrick: Finland!\nDoodleBob: Meyaiovah! Mee hoy minoy! Meah froyay!\nSpongeBob: There he is.\nPatrick: He's hideous. He makes me sick, just looking at him. Those big bulgy eyes, that square body, those two buck teeth, and that stupid tie!\nSpongeBob: Ahem.\nPatrick: Oh... but it looks good on you, SpongeBob! Heh heh.\nSpongeBob: He's putting down the pencil! This is our chance. On the count of three, we'll jump out and surprise him!\nPatrick: Oh, boy, a surprise party! Is it his birthday?\nDoodleBob: Bawahh bwah bwah wahh!\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Do something!\nPatrick: Happy birthday!\nPatrick: Here's your present.  You're welcome.\nDoodleBob: Dewaaagheaugaaagh!\nSpongeBob: Hold it right there, Doodle. I brought you into this world and now I'm gonna take you out. Any last words?\nDoodleBob: Bee ha, bala hala ba ba!\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, what was that?\nDoodleBob: Bee ha, bala hala ba ba!\nSpongeBob: Hold still, Doodle. This is for your own good.  Take that and this and this and that and this that this that...  I am SpongeBob, destroyer of evil!\nPatrick: Take it easy. It's just a drawing.\nSpongeBob: Well, that takes care of that, eh, Patrick?\nPatrick: Done and done.\nSpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you should have been there! It sure was exciting, but you know, I kind of miss the little doodle. He was like a son to me. But I'm sure glad things are back to normal. Well, good night, sweet prince.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Good night, magic pencil.  Oh, hey, Magic Pencil. What are you doing up? Drawing yourself a glass of water?   DoodleBob!  No hard feelings, right?   What do you think you're doing, doodle?!\nDoodleBob: You Doodle! Me SpongeBob!  Huh?\nSpongeBob: Be careful with that thing! Who knows what will happen?  I nose.  Very funny, doodle. Now it's my turn.  Well, Doodle, it looks like this is a draw.  You've made your point, no matter, I was voted most artistic in high school.\nSquidward: Ouch! SpongeBob, you're gonna pay for that!\nSpongeBob: Or maybe it was most clumsy.  Huh?  Paper!  Page for Mr. Doodle!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, what's with all the ruckus?\nSpongeBob: Take a look for yourself, Patrick.\nPatrick: It's the evil Doodle!\nSpongeBob: No, no, not evil. He was just a two-dimensional creature lost in our three-dimensional aquatic world longing for a purpose.\nPatrick: So... he's a drawing?\nSpongeBob: Exactly! See how happy he is?\nPatrick: He still looks kind of creepy.\nSpongeBob: O, great Magic Pencil, your powers are too mighty for us ocean dwellers. So I will send you back to the magic kingdom from where you came. Are you ready, Patrick?\nPatrick: Ready!\nFrench Narrator: We rejoin the artist in a creative slump.\nArtist: Huh? What's this?  My pencil!\nFrench Narrator: The second most important rule for the artist at sea: Always bring a pencil sharpener.\nArtist: Noooooo!\n","35a\nThe Secret Box\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick! Oh, Patrick! Are you ready to go jellyfishing?\nPatrick: Oh, boy, am I!\nSpongeBob: Here's your net.  Well, come on, Patrick! The jellyfish don't catch themselves.\nPatrick: First, I have to put away my secret box.\nSpongeBob: Secret box? You never told me about your... secret box!\nPatrick: Hey, hands off, PeepingBob! This here is my secret box! Besides, if I showed you what was inside, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Duh!  Oh, SpongeBob\u2026 if only you could see what's inside my secret box, it would change your life!\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick, I know all about secrets.\nPatrick: You do?\nSpongeBob: I've got a gazillion secrets!\nPatrick: Like what?\nSpongeBob: Well, it's not a secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Secretly.\nSpongeBob: You wanna hear one of my secrets?\nPatrick: Do I?\nSpongeBob: Uhh... Let's see...  Did you know that you're my best friend?\nPatrick: No... way. Oh, let's hear another one!\nSpongeBob: Okay. Uhh... Secretly... I'm a little bit na\xefve.\nPatrick: Wow! I'll never look at you the same way again, SpongeBob. Gosh.  Tell me some more secrets!\nSpongeBob: Okay. I love my job at the Krusty Krab, I sleep with my shoes on, I like jelly on both sides of my toast, I've got an overdue library book, I think Jelly-Fishing and Bubble-Blowing are the\u2026  ...overbite. I've never been late for work, I've said the word \"fancy\" in conversation, I like to dance to loading zone announcements, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm a little bit on the short side. And I'm wearing three pairs of underwear, right now.\nPatrick: Gasp. I never would have guessed.\nSpongeBob: Now will you show me what's inside your secret box?\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob! It's for me to know and for you to never find out. You may be an open book, SpongeBob, but I'm a bit more complicated than that. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah?! Well, I got plenty of secret stuff, too! Uh\u2026  I've got my secret socks on.  And my secret Gary's bowl!  My secret TV!  And my secret TV channel.  What do you think of that, Patrick? Patrick?\nPatrick: Maybe if you saw what was inside, you'd know why it has to be secret.  Inside this very box is the most secret-y secret of all of secret-dom and I am it's sole witness! It's a heavy burden, SpongeBob, but nobody must know the secret of the box.  Nobody! Not even\u2026 Squidward's house.  It's a full-time job. I'm constantly on the alert. You never know when someone's gonna\u2026  SpongeBob! What do you think you're doing?! That's my secret box! Now, hand it over!\nSpongeBob: But, Patrick, I must know the secret!\nPatrick: For the last time, SpongeBob, no!\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, just a peek?\nPatrick: Never!  So, it's come to this. And to think that we joined the Best Friends Forever Club!  Listen up, SpongeBob SecretStealerPants!  If you ever come close to my secret box again, we won't be friends anymore!\nSpongeBob: But... we're supposed to be...  friends forever.  I feel so filthy!  I have soiled our friendship garden! I just couldn't help myself!  I know it's your secret! I promise to respect that! Oh, please forgive me, Patrick! Please!\nPatrick: Well... I guess it's not all your fault. After all, this is a pretty great secret. I mean, how could you resist the greatest secret ever?  The most amazing...  mysterious... powerful secret in all Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: So, what do you say, buddy? Friends?\nPatrick: Friends.\nSpongeBob: What could be in that box that Patrick doesn't want me to see? Maybe it's the world's only albino jellyfish!  Or maybe Patrick's a master jewel thief and it's full of diamonds.  Or maybe Patrick's a deranged maniac who keeps his victims' severed heads in a box.  Or even worse! Maybe it's an embarrassing snapshot of me from the Christmas party!  I've gotta find out what's in that secret box! I'm not gonna rest until I do!  That's it! How do you look in a secret box?  Secretly, of course! I'll just take the box while Patrick's sleeping, look in that box, and before Patrick even has time to notice, I'll slide it back.  Patrick won't know when I'll have my own little secret. Good idea, eh, Gary?\nGary: Meeh\u2026 No.\nSpongeBob: Oh, what do you know? You're a snail!\nPatrick: Seee... cret.\nSpongeBob: I got to be more quiet. I don't want to wake Patrick up.\nPatrick: Duh... who's there?\nSpongeBob: Shhh!\nPatrick: Eh?!  Who's that?!  Mmm... water.  Good old secret box. Let's see what's inside.  Nighty-night, boxie.\nSpongeBob: Gee, Patrick sure is a heavy sleeper.\nPatrick: Huh? Who said that?! Who's there?!\nSpongeBob: Uh\u2026\nPatrick: It's the Clam Burglar! And he's stealing my secret box!  Hand over the goods, Secret Box Bandit, and prepare for the most unpleasant pillow fight of your life!\nSpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait, Patrick! Stop!  It's me, SpongeBob!\nPatrick: Nice try, burglar, but SpongeBob's my best friend, and he'd never steal from me.\nSpongeBob: No, really, Patrick! Look!\nSpongeBob and Patrick BFF Ring: It's the Best Friends Forever, Best Friends Forever Ring!\nPatrick: Our friendship ring! It is you!  How could you do thi-i-i-i-is?!?\nSpongeBob: If it makes you feel any better, I haven't looked inside.\nPatrick: That's it, SpongeBob! You have crossed the line. As of right now, this friendship is over!\nSpongeBob: Really?\nPatrick: Nahhh, you can look inside it if you really want to.\nSpongeBob: Okay! Oh, this is one the most exciting moments of my life! Well, here it goes!  Huh?\nPatrick: Well, didn't I tell ya?  Isn't it great?\nSpongeBob: It's just a string.\nPatrick: A secret string!\nSpongeBob: Boy, when you're right, you're right! That's some secret box you've got there! Yeah! Thanks for showing me that!  Well, good night, Patrick. See you tomorrow!\nPatrick: Good night, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: I should've known! It was just a piece of string all along!  Wait 'till I tell Gary!\nPatrick: Good thing he didn't pull the secret string, opening the...  ...secret compartment of my secret box...  ...revealing one embarrassing snapshot of SpongeBob at the Christmas Party!  Merry Christmas, SpongeBob!\n","35b\nBand Geeks\nDoctor Forrest: Yeah, uhh, we're with the pet hospital down the street and I understand that you have a dying animal on the premises.\nSquidward: Hello. You've reached the house of unrecognized talent. Please start after the\nSquilliam: Sounds like you've got a dying animal to attend to, eh, ol' chum?\nSquidward: Squilliam Fancyson from band class?!\nSquilliam: I hear you're playing the cash register now.\nSquidward: Sometimes. Uh, how's the unibrow?\nSquilliam: It's big and valuable. I'm the leader of a big fancy band now, and we're supposed to play the Bubble Bowl next week.\nSquidward: The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba... The ba-ba-ba?!?!\nSquilliam: That's right. I'm living your dreams, Squidward. The problem is, I'm busy next week and can't make it. So, I was hoping you and your band could cover for us.\nSquidward: Ohh, uhh, I... I, uhh...\nSquilliam: I knew it! You don't even have a band! Well, I'll just let you get back to the service industry now.\nSquidward: Hold it! It just so happens that I don't sell fast food, I do have a band, and we're gonna play that Bubble Bowl! How do you like that, Fancy Boy?!\nSquilliam: Good luck next Tuesday. I hope the audience brings lots of... ibuprofen!\nSquidward: I gotta drum up a marching band fast! Drum... haha... band humor.\nSandy: Looking to add fulfillment to your dull, dull life?\nPlankton: Then become part of the greatest musical sensation to ever hit Bikini Bottom.\nMrs. Puff: And be forever adored by thousands of people you don't know.\nMr. Krabs: Not to mention free refreshments.\nLarry: Practice begins tonight. 8:30 sharp.\nSquidward: Stupid music rental clerk made me late. That trilobite didn't know an oboe from an elbow. Elbow, heh, more band humor.\nAll: Blah, blah, blah, blah...\nSquidward: People, people, settle down! Okay, now. How many of you have played musical instruments before?\nPlankton: Do instruments of torture count?\nSquidward: No.\nPatrick: Is mayonnaise an instrument?\nSquidward: No, Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument.  Horseradish is not an instrument, either.  That's fine. No one has any experience. Fortunately, I have enough talent for all of you.\nMr. Krabs: When do we get the free food?\nSquidward: Okay, try to repeat after me.  Brass section, go.  Good. Now the wind.  And the drums.  Too bad that didn't kill me.  Let's just try stepping in the rhythm. Now I want everyone to stand in straight rows of five.\nSpongeBob: Is this the part where we start kicking?\nSquidward: No, SpongeBob, that's a chorus line.\nPatrick: Kicking? I wanna do some kicking!\nSandy: Ow! Why, you...! Why I oughta...!\nPatrick:  Whoever is the owner of the white sedan, you left your lights on.\nNarrator: Day two.\nSquidward: Okay, that's perfect, everybody. Bubble Bowl, here we come. Flag twirlers, really spin those things. Okay, turn. Flag twirlers, let's go. I wanna see some spinning. Flag twirlers, let's move! C'mon, move!\nNarrator: Day three.\nSquidward: How's that harmonica solo coming, Plankton?\nPlankton: It's tremendous, you wanna see?\nNarrator: Day four.\nSquidward: Well, this is our last night together before the show. And I know that none of you improved since we began...  ...but I have a theory. People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?\nPlankton: Correct!\nSquidward: So, if we play loud, people might think we're good. Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a one, two, three, four!  Okay, new theory. Maybe we should play so quietly, no one can hear us.\nHarold: Well, maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty claws!\nMr. Krabs: What did you say, punk?!\nHarold: Big... meaty... claws!\nMr. Krabs: Well, these claws ain't for just attractin' mates!\nHarold: Bring it on, old man! Bring it on!\nSpongeBob: No, people. Let's be smart and bring it off.\nNancy: Oh, so now the talking cheese is gonna preach to us.\nSquidward: Wait, wait. I know tensions are high...  There's a deposit on that equipment, people!  Settle down, please!\nFred: Hey, class is over.\nSquidward: Well, you did it. You took my one chance in happiness... and crushed it! Crushed it into little, tiny, bite-size pieces. I really had expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So, thanks.  Thanks for nothing!\nPatrick: You're welcome.\nSpongeBob: What kind of monsters are we? That poor creature came to us in his hour of need, and we failed him. Squidward's always been there for us when it was convenient for him. Evelyn, when your little Jimmy was trapped in a fire, who rescued him?\nEvelyn: A fireman.\nSpongeBob: And Larry, when your heart gave out from all those tanning pills, who revived you?\nLarry: Some guy in an ambulance.\nSpongeBob: Right. So, if we can all just pretend that Squidward was a fireman, or some guy in an ambulance, then I'm sure that we can all pull together and discover what it truly means to be in a marching band.\nHarold: Yeah, for the fireman!\nAll: Hooray!\nSpongeBob: Now let's make Squidward proud. A 1, a 2, a skiddly diddly doo.\nSquidward: I knew this was gonna happen. They're just gonna have to find another band to play. I just hope that...  ...Squilliam doesn't find out! Squilliam!  What are you doing here?!\nSquilliam: I just wanna watch you blow it. So, where's your band?\nSquidward: Uh, they couldn't come. They... died.\nSquilliam: Then who's that?\nSquidward: That would be my band!\nSpongeBob: We're ready to perform, Squidward.\nSquilliam: Well, Squiddy, this is exactly how I pictured your band would look.\nSquidward: That's his... eager face.\nSquidward: I guess this will be the last time I can show my face in this town.\nSpongeBob: That's the spirit, Squidward!\nFootball Announcer: Okay, football fans. Put your hands together for the Bikini Bottom Super Band!\nPatrick: These are some ugly looking fish.\nSpongeBob: Maybe we're in one of those toxic waste dumps.\nMr. Krabs: I think I'm gonna be sick.\nSquidward: Alright, everybody.  Let's get this over with. 1, 2, 3, 4...\nSpongeBob: \u266aThe winner takes all, it's the thrill of one more kill. The last one to fall will never sacrifice their will.

And it's ours for the taking, it's ours for the fight,\u266a  \u266aAnd it's sweet, sweet, sweet victory, yeah. And the one who's last to fall.

You mean, if we stayed open later, you'd give us your money?\nTom: Sure!\nMr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward,  welcome to the night shift. From now on, the Krusty Krab is open 24 hours a day.\nSquidward: What!?\nSpongeBob: Wow! Now we never have to stop working!\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs..\nMr. Krabs: See ya in the morning, boys! I can't hang out here all night! I've got a life.\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs?\nSpongeBob: Isn't this great, Squidward?! Just you and me together for hours and hours and hours and then the sun'll come up and it'll be tomorrow and we'll still be working!  It'll be just like a sleepover! Only we'll be sweaty and covered with grease!  Are you ready to rock, Squidward?!\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: Good! 'Cause we've got customers!\nSquidward: Here. Please hit me as hard as you can.\nSpongeBob: Psst, Squidward. I'm working in the kitchen  at night!\nSquidward: Don't hold back.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Guess what? I'm chopping lettuce...at night.  Look at me, I'm swabbing the bathroom...at night.  I burned my hand!...at night.

For the Krusty Krab!  Piece of cake!\nSquidward: So you're not afraid?\nSpongeBob: Pfft, nah.\nSquidward: Well I am. Especially after,  well, you know.\nSpongeBob: What? What do I know?\nSquidward: You don't remember? It was all over the news.\nSpongeBob: Tell me! Tell me!\nSquidward: No, no, no, I probably shouldn't. It would ruin the night shift for you.\nSpongeBob: What happened, what happened, what happened!?\nSquidward: You mean you've never heard the story of the  \"Hash-Slinging Slasher?\"\nSpongeBob: The Slash-Bringing Hasher?\nSquidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!\nSpongeBob: The Sash-Ringing, the Trash-Singing, Mash-Flinging, The Flash-Springing, Ringing, The Cr-Crash-Dinging, daa.\nSquidward: Yes. The Hash-Slinging Slasher. But, most people just call him The Ha--- because that's all they have time to say before he gets them!\nSpongeBob: Tell me the story!\nSquidward: Years ago at this very restaurant, the Hash-Slinging Slasher used to be a fry cook - just like you - only clumsier. And then, one night, when he was cutting the patties ...it happened.\nSpongeBob: He forgot the secret sauce?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: He didn't wash his hands?\nSquidward: No!\nSpongeBob: Irregular portions?\nSquidward: NO! He cut off his own hand by mistake.\nSpongeBob: You mean like this?  Or like this?  Or this?  Or this?  But what about this? Or this, or this, or this, or...\nSquidward: Except he wasn't a sponge!\nSpongeBob: So?\nSquidward: So it didn't grow back!\nSpongeBob: Oh, no!\nSquidward: And he replaced his hand with a rusty spatula. And then, he got hit by a bus! And...at his funeral, they fired him! So now, every...what day is it?\nSpongeBob: Tuesday.\nSquidward: Tuesday night, his ghost returns to The Krusty Krab to wreak his horrible vengeance.\nSpongeBob: But tonight's Tuesday night!\nSquidward: Then he'll be coming.\nSpongeBob: How will we know?\nSquidward: There are three signs that signal the approach of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. First, the lights will flicker on and off. Next...\nHarold: Dude, can I have some ketchup?\nSquidward: Oh, here you go.  Next, the phone will ring and there will be nobody there.  And finally, the Hash-Slinging Slasher arrives in the ghost of the bus that ran him over.  Then he exits the bus and crosses the street without looking both ways because he's already dead!  Then he taps on the window with his grizzly spatula hand..\nSpongeBob: No.\nSquidward: He opens the door  He slowly approaches the counter  ...and you know what he does next?\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: You really want to know?\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: Are you sure you want to know?\nSpongeBob: What, what, what does he do?!\nSquidward: He gets ya!  SpongeBob...  SpongeBob I wa...  I was ju...  I was jus...  SpongeBob, I was joking!\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: It's not true! None of it's true!\nSpongeBob: It's not?\nSquidward: Of course not. Nobody has a spatula for a hand. It was all a joke.\nSpongeBob: Ohhhhh.\nSpongeBob: Isn't this great, Squidward?  There's never time to wash the ceiling during the day.\nSquidward: Open 24 hours a day. What a stupid idea! Who wants a Krabby Patty at three in the morning?\nPatrick: Oh, boy! Three A.M.!\nSquidward: Just look at this place. It's like a ghost town in here!  Very funny, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: \"And the lights will flicker on and off.\" Just like the story. I get it.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, how are you doing that without moving the switch?\nSquidward: I'm not doing it. It must be the stupid, faulty wiring in here. This place isn't built to run 24 hours a day!  What, what, hello? Hello? Hello?\nSpongeBob: Nice try, Squidward.\nSquidward: Nice try, what?\nSpongeBob: \"The phone will ring and there will be no one there.\"  Oh, you crack me up.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I'm not doing this.  Oh no, calm down, calm down. All right, what was it? There was the lights,  and the phone,  and the walls will ooze green slime!  No, wait. They always do that. But what was that third thing?\nSpongeBob: I didn't know the buses ran this late.\nSquidward: They don't!\nSpongeBob: Well, they're dropping someone off.\nSquidward: The Sash-Ringing, Flash-Singing, the Bash-Pinging...\nSpongeBob: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!\nSquidward: At last you understand! We're doomed!\nSpongeBob: No, that's not it.  I am just so touched that you would go through the trouble to dress up as a ghostly fry cook and stand on the other side of the street, just to entertain me! You must really like me!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, there are two problems with your theory. One - I hate you. And two - how can that be me when I'm standing right here!?\nSpongeBob and Squidward: The Hash-Slinging Slasher!\nSpongeBob: He's going to flip me! Get away! Get away!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, no matter what I've said, I've always sort of liked you!\nSpongeBob: Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!\nSquidward: Huh?\nSpongeBob: Get away! Get away! You're not welcome here!\nRichard: Can I have a job application? I brought my own spatula.  I called here earlier, but I hung up 'cause I was nervous.\nSpongeBob: Do you have references?\nSquidward: Wait, if that was you on the phone and you on the bus, then who was flickering the lights?\nSpongeBob, Squidward and Richard: Nosferatu!\n","36b\nKrusty Love\nMr. Krabs: Da da dee.  Stitch one purl two. da da dee doo.  Da day dee da. Dee doh..  What's that smell?  The register!  $49.0... 8?! That's a penny short!\nSquidward: Oh, no. Not a penny. Help! Somebody, help us.\nSpongeBob: It's just a penny, sir.  It doesn't matter.\nMr. Krabs: Doesn't matter? It's money that makes the world go round, boy! It's money that keeps your  pants square! It's money that keeps Squidward in frilly soap!\nSquidward: Lilac!\nMr. Krabs: It's money that paid for all them renovations we did! Oh, nothing in all the seven seas could matter more. Not even that...  Hmm? ...scrumptious, curvy cutie.\nSpongeBob: I see her, Mr. Krabs.  A Krabby Patty with cheese.  The classic.\nMr. Krabs: Not the sandwich, boy. The curvy cutie holding the sandwich.\nSpongeBob: Hey!  that's my driving teacher, Mrs. Puff!\nMr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff? Aw, she's married.\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. She's single.\nMr. Krabs: Then what happened to Mr. Puff?\nSpongeBob: She doesn't like to talk about it.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, what I wouldn't give to have a lass like that on me claw.\nSpongeBob: Hey, I know! Why don't I take you over and introduce you?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no, I, I'm, I'm too old, boy. Too hard-shelled for love. Besides, I ain't not properly dressed.\nSpongeBob: Oh, come on, Mr. Krabs!  You look great.  You wait here while I go break the ice.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, no, wait! I'm too nervous! Ooh!\nSpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff.\nMrs. Puff: Hit the brakes, SpongeBob! Watch that tree! Left! Left!\nSpongeBob: Wait, Mrs. Puff! We're not driving.\nMrs. Puff: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I didn't expect to see you here.\nSpongeBob: I work here, Mrs. Puff. Want to meet my boss?\nMrs. Puff: Well, I'm not...\nSpongeBob: Don't move!\nMrs. Puff: Oh!\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff,  I'd like to introduce you to Mr...  Mrs. Puff, I'd like to introduce you to my boss, Mr. Krabs.\nMrs. Puff: Uh, hello.\nSpongeBob: Psst! Mr. Krabs, say hello.  No, no, Mr. Krabs. Just say hello.\nMrs. Puff: Hmm, perhaps another time would be...\nMr. Krabs: No!\nSpongeBob: Wait.  He's trying to tell you something.\nMrs. Puff: Mr. Krabs?  I don't understand.\nSpongeBob: Oh! I think Mr. Krabs is saying that he'd like to...  ...hit you with a rake!\nMrs. Puff: Goodness!\nMr. Krabs: No!\nSpongeBob: Try to guess your weight.\nMrs. Puff: Well!\nSpongeBob: No, wait. He wants to take you...  ...on a date!\nMrs. Puff: Is that true, Mr. Krabs? Do you want to take me on a date?\nMr. Krabs: Aye. What do you say?\nMrs. Puff: What do I say?  I say, you have a way with words, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: I still got it.\nSpongeBob: Ready for your date, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I'm always ready when it comes to datin', lad!\nSpongeBob: Breath spray?\nMr. Krabs: Check.\nSpongeBob: Lucky hanky?\nMr. Krabs: Check.\nSpongeBob: Giant rusty anchor?\nMr. Krabs: Uh, anchor. Anchor? I can't find me giant rusty anchor!\nSpongeBob: Relax, Mr. Krabs.  Just a little joke.  Good luck with you know who.\nMr. Krabs: Who's that?\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, yeah. Well, wish me luck, lad!\nMrs. Puff: Oh, Mr. Krabs!  This dinner has been so wonderful. The coral was cooked to perfection.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I doubt that, my little shrimp boat.\nMrs. Puff: You're spoiling me, Mr. Krabs. I mean,  foot rubs between courses.  Caricatures. Imported music.\nMr. Krabs: Nothing's too good for you, my prickly peach.\nMrs. Puff: Oh, what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Krabs, is...\nWaiter: Uh, sir, your fancy pantsy limousine is here.\nMr. Krabs: Wonderful! Pufflily-poo, your chariot awaits!\nMrs. Puff: Well...\nMr. Krabs: You'll never have to walk again, my little lobster bib.\nWaiter: Your bill, sir.\nMr. Krabs: What?  $100?! Well, this can't possibly be correct!\nWaiter: Oh, my mistake, sir. Thank you for pointing that out.  This is your bill.\nSpongeBob: I don't understand, Mr. Krabs. How can you spend $100,000 in one night?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob! I couldn't help but spend every cent I had on her! I couldn't control myself!\nSpongeBob: What are you gonna do?\nMr. Krabs: I don't know, boy! I've got another date tomorrow! I'm caught in the middle of me two great loves! Sweet Mrs. Puff, and the rest of me money!\nSpongeBob: I wish there was some way I could help.\nMr. Krabs: Perhaps there is, boy!  I'm puttin' you in charge of me money.\nSpongeBob: I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: You come with me on the date and don't let me spend any money.  Now remember, we keep it cheap by going to the park. And no matter how much I ask you, you don't give me any of me money. Now give me a dollar.\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nMr. Krabs: Good boy! You'll do fine.\nMrs. Puff: Who is it?\nMr. Krabs: It's me,  my beautiful bell buoy!\nMrs. Puff: Just a minute!\nMr. Krabs: Flowers! Flowers, boy! Go get flowers!\nSpongeBob: But you said...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't call on a classy lady like Mrs. Puff empty-handed. We ain't talking about this...  ...or this...  ...we're talking about this!\nMrs. Puff: Almost ready.\nMr. Krabs: Hurry, boy! Get the flowers!\nMr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff. You're as beautiful as ever.\nMrs. Puff: That's funny. I thought I heard SpongeBob's voice.\nMr. Krabs: Uh... you did. He'll be right back. He's our personal assistant for the day.\nMrs. Puff: Oh, e-excuse me. I have to call my insurance agent.\nMr. Krabs: Of course, my beautiful Puff.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs,  I got the flowers you wanted me to buy.\nMr. Krabs: What's that?\nSpongeBob: I got the flowers for Mrs. Puff.\nMr. Krabs: We had an agreement, boy. You ain't supposed to spend any of me money!\nSpongeBob: But you said...\nMrs. Puff: Here I come!\nMr. Krabs: For you, Mrs. Puff!\nMrs. Puff: Oh,  flowers. Oh, how thoughtful!\nMr. Krabs: And here's a box of chocolates.  SpongeBob, where's the chocolates?\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, the budget doesn't allow for...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you can't go to Mrs. Puff's house without chocolates. Hurry! Hurry!\nSpongeBob: I bought the biggest box they had!\nMr. Krabs: Buy, buy, buy! Spend, spend, spend! Is that all you can think about?!\nMrs. Puff: Oh, Eugene!\nMr. Krabs: Here's those chocolates I bought for you. What are we doing today, Mrs. Puff? Dinner? Dancing? A trip to the moon?\nSpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs, we're just going for a walk in the park, remember?\nMrs. Puff: Actually, a walk in the park sounds perfect. It's a beautiful day. I'll just need to get a sun hat and...\nMr. Krabs: Mrs. Puff needs a sun hat, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Oh, I think she...\nMr. Krabs: The sun is beatin' down on poor Mrs. Puff's head.\nSpongeBob: As your financial advisor, I suggest...\nMr. Krabs: There's no time for suggestions! Go buy a hat!\nSpongeBob: But...\nMr. Krabs: Today!  Don't worry, Mrs. Puff! I'll  shade ya!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, hurry!\nSpongeBob: One shady hat.\nMr. Krabs: Good job, lad.\nMrs. Puff: Oh, well, thank you, but you didn't need to buy one. I have a hat in the closet.\nMr. Krabs: Didn't need to buy one?  You hear that, boy?  We didn't need to buy a hat.  Aren't you supposed to be saving me money?!\nSpongeBob: I'm trying, Mr. Krabs! But you keep telling me to buy things for Mrs. Puff! It's all really confusing.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I'm sorry. This is my fault. I'm not thinking clearly. I'm making a sailor's promise, boy. From this moment on, I won't ask you to buy anything for Mrs. Puff!\nNarrator: A few moments later...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Mrs. Puff needs a new fur coat!\nMr. Krabs: You're spending all me money!  Puffy needs a new pair of shoes!\nMr. Krabs: You're breaking me, boy!  She needs fine jewelry!  Not that fine!  SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! I'm glad I caught you. I want you to buy Mrs. Puff...\nSpongeBob: Wait! Don't tell me. You want me to run down to the store and buy Mrs. Puff something she doesn't need! Then you want me to run back here so you can say,  \"Arrgh, SpongeBob! You're spending all me money!\" And then I'll say, \"But Mr. Krabs, I'm only doing what you said!\" Then you'll say, \"We're not talking about this...\"  ...\"Or this\"...  ...\"we're talking about this!\"\nMr. Krabs: But, lad, this time's different! Mrs. Puff needs this!\nMrs. Puff: Are we going to the park soon?\nMr. Krabs: Please, lad, I'm begging you! I'm a lonely old crustacean who's found love! Don't let me lose her!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, don't. Don't cry, Mr. Krabs! Come on. Okay, I, I'm going to get it, see?  Cheer up, Mr. Krabs, Here's that washing machine you wanted.\nMr. Krabs: Cheer up? How can I cheer up... when you're spending all me hard-earned cash?!\nSpongeBob: See?! You just did it again!\nMr. Krabs: Lad, I can't help it if you're loose with other people's money.  Do you think Mrs. Puff will need a dryer to go along with that?\nSpongeBob: Well, Mr. Krabs. Do you want to know what I think?  Arrgh! Regga flebba breeka brecka smullen-ellen Mr. Krabs! Yegga hegga mergin wallet! Dimmy middy spend! Rivy flivy diva shiva Mr. Krabs Wallet!\nMrs. Puff: I didn't know SpongeBob had such a colorful vocabulary. Actually, there's something I'd like to say, too, Mr. Krabs.  I'm afraid I just don't feel comfortable accepting all these gifts. I'd rather go Dutch, if you don't mind.\nMr. Krabs: Uh, okay.\nMrs. Puff: You're a very sweet man, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Aawww...\n","37a\nProcrastination\nMrs. Puff: Okay, class, quiet, quiet. Now get out your pencil and paper and write down the assignment.\nSpongeBob: Did you hear that? We get an assignment!\nMrs. Puff: Everyone must write an essay on what not to do at a stoplight.\nSpongeBob: Did you hear that? What not to do at a stoplight?\nMrs. Puff: In no less than 800 words!\nNat: Did you hear that? 800 words!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I know!\nMrs. Puff: Due tomorrow. And remember, class: work hard and no goofing off.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Gary, no goofing off! I am about to write the greatest essay of all time. Like most great essays, it will be written on paper. Even more important than the paper is  the pencil. A pencil as sharp or as dull as I like. Hmm.. funny... as my ideas grow, you shrink.  Well, I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to write an essay.  Okay, here we go. What. Not. To do. At. A. Stoplight. Hey, this is easy! By SpongeBob SquarePants. Hah! This essay is pure gold! And now, pencil, get ready to do your stuff because here we go!  Gee, this is harder than I thought...\nPatrick: Come on, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: It should be against the law to have to write an essay on such a super sailorific, sunshiny day! Oh! But I must press onward, because with this pencil, and the completion of this essay, I'll be one step closer to my driver's license!  Oh, yeah. This'll be no problemo. Why, I've got plenty of time. It's only 6:00!  Okay, here we go, here we go.  Bah! I know! I just need to get a little blood pumpin' in the old noodle. How about some calisthenics?  I can feel those juices pumpin' now!  Huh? What am I doing?! I've gotta write that paper!  Come on, pencil, make words.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Gary! Hey, hey, hey, Gary! How's my favorite mollusk? How about you let ol' SpongeBob fix you up something to eat?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: What do you mean you're not hungry?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I know I have an essay to write! Now come on, Gary!  I've got to make sure you have your nutrition, Gary, so I'm not leaving until you eat every single bite.  Gary, are-are you sure you don't want some cr\xe8me brul\xe9e? Or, or some chocolate-flavored algae bits?  Gee, Gary sure made a mess. I can't work on my essay knowing there's a mess in the kitchen.  Hmmm...I might as well clean the rest of the floor while I'm at it. I should get these hard-to-reach places, too! And these dishes need to be cleaned! Can't have dirty garbage.  Well, I think it's clean enough now! Why that didn't take too long...and it's only...10:00! Ooh... No more fooling around! I've gotta get back to work! Okay, Mr. Essay, I say... prepare to be written!  I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Yeah...yeah...yeah! And some of these, and some of these...Almost there and...done. Now let\u2019s see how it looks so far. \"The-\"  Break time! Pacing always helps me think! Let's see, only 799 words to go...think, SpongeBob, think!\nPatrick: Who is that?

Any dreams you'd like to discuss, I remember on the...\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you and I both know that you're just choosing me as a distraction so you don't have to write your essay.\nSpongeBob: That is-that is not true! I called to have an engaging conversation with you!\nPatrick: Well, I'm listening.\nSpongeBob: Uh...Marco!\nPatrick: Polo.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, well I gotta get going, Patrick, got an important essay to write?  Sheesh, what a chatterbox. Can't he see that I'm busy?  I can't write with all these eraser shavings all over my paper! Now they're floating around my thinking space.  So long, Pesky Particles!  I swallowed one! I'm choking! Water, water!  That was a close one.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: What do you mean 'overly dramatic?', Gary? All that choking sure made me hungry.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I can't write on an empty stomach, Gary, I gotta have my brain food! Now let's see...White or rye bread...or pumpernickel. Gee, I guess it really depends on the meat inside... and the cheese  A visitor? For me!?  Hello!\nMailfish: Package for Mr. SquarePants.\nSpongeBob: Great, thanks! So, uh, do you like delivering mail?\nMailfish: It puts bread on the table.\nSpongeBob: Rye or pumpernickel?\nMaifish: Oh, brother..\nSpongeBob: So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen? Well, I guess a P.O. box could in theory break the chain...\nMailfish: Don't you have a paper to write?\nSpongeBob: How did he know I'm supposed to be writing an essay?\nJohnny Elaine: In other news, local resident SpongeBob SquarePants only has a few hours left to complete his essay, and yet he continues to goof off.  When will he learn?\nSpongeBob: Hi-yah!\nChair: Hey, SpongeBob? Over here! Come on, take a seat, put your feet up and relax.\nSpongeBob: Oh no! Midnight!  Must.. get... back to desk!  Whew, that was a close call.  Ah! My pants!\nPants: Yoo hoo! Down here!\nSpongeBob: You get up here! I've got to get back to work!\nPants: Freedom!\nSpongeBob: Stop, Pants! You get back here this instant! Paaants...!\nClock: Time's up, SpongeBob...\nSpongeBob: Burning!\nFlame: Only 799 words to go!\nSpongeBob: No!  What have I done?!  Help! Help! My house is on fire!\nHouse: SpongeBob, why?! Why did you set me on fire, SpongeBob?! Why didn't you just write your essay?!  Stop wasting time!\nSpongeBob: Huh!? Where's my essay? Oh, there you are!  I must have dozed off.  Let\u2019s see, where are we?  Do I dare look at the clock..?  It's almost 9:00! Class starts in 5 minutes! How am I going to write this whole paper in 5 minutes?! How am I supposed to know what to do at a stoplight? Feeding your snail is something not to do at a stoplight...  And... making a sandwich, and lighting candles, and drinking water, and calling your friends, and karate chopping the TV, and shootin' the breeze with the mailman, and fallin' asleep...  Mrs. Puff! Mrs. Puff! I'm finished! All 800 words! I'm finished! Here it is!  Huh? Mrs. Puff? Where is everybody?\nMrs. Puff: Oh, there you are, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Here you go, Mrs. Puff! 800 words! All about stoplights and what not to do at 'em.\nMrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I tried to call you.. I have to go to a teacher's convention!\nSpongeBob: But what about my essay?\nMrs. Puff: I decided to cancel the assignment. We're just going to take a field trip to a stoplight instead. See you next week!\n","37b\nI'm with Stupid\nPatrick: Need...furniture!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what's with the home improvement?  Hey, Patrick!\nPatrick: Oooooooh, sweep sweep!\nSpongeBob: Well, Patrick, I came over to see if you wanted to go jellyfishing. But I can see you're busy having an episode.\nPatrick: You know something, SpongeBob? It's just all fun and games for you. Nothing really matters.  \"Oh, let's go jellyfishing! We don't have any work to do! Life is just a big bowl of fancy assorted cashews, and nobody has anything to dust or to clean or to wipe! Or fabricate!\"\nSpongeBob: But, Patrick, the only thing I've ever seen you clean is your plate.\nPatrick: I don't know what to do, SpongeBob. You gotta to help me!\nSpongeBob: Patrick! You forgot how to eat again! Come on, we'll get the funnel.\nPatrick: No, it's not that, SpongeBob; it's worse.\nSpongeBob: Darn, I like the funnel. Well, what is it, then?\nPatrick: Look!\nSpongeBob: Hey, a note!\nPatrick: Yeah, but turn it over, there's a letter!\nSpongeBob: You're right!\nPatrick: And, I got this message from my parents!\nSpongeBob: Your parents?  \"Dear Patrick, your mom and I are coming out tomorrow for Starfish Day. Please try to remember, but don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself like last time. Love, Daddy.\"\nPatrick: SpongeBob, my parents think I'm dumber than a sack of diapers.\nSpongeBob: No, they don't, Patrick. Parents just like to push your buttons. Like this!  Nauuugh!\nPatrick: That always cheers me up.  But not today.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, if your parents think you're dumb, then they must not know what dumb really is.\nPatrick: But don't they watch television?\nSpongeBob: That's what I'm saying, Pat! If your parents got to meet a real dummy, they'd realize what a genius you really are!\nPatrick: But don't geniuses live in a lamp? And besides, we don't know any dumb people.\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick! I'll be the dummy! When your parents see how dumb I act, they'll think you're the smartest guy ever!\nPatrick: Math is power!\nPatrick: A, B, C, D, E, F, G...  Oh! H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...!\nJanet: Should I get the bullhorn again, Marty?\nPatrick: W, X, Y and Z!  Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\nMarty: Son! You recognized us this time!\nPatrick: Why wouldn't I recognize my own parents?\nMarty: You never were a bright one.  Well, aren't you gonna show us inside?\nJanet: He probably forgot where it is.\nPatrick: Well, I know where it...\nMarty: Oh, let me lead the way so we don't get lost.  Huh? Hold hands now!  Okay, we're almost there! Let go on three. One... two... three!\nJanet: Good job!\nMarty and Janet: Pats for Patrick!\nPatrick: I'll go get the beverages.\nMarty: Wow, son! You put the drinks in something this time! Ah, son, you must've been working all night to put these together for us.\nJanet and Marty: We love you!\nPatrick: Hooray, the idiot's here! I mean, I'll get it!\nSpongeBob: Protective helmet, check.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I'm supposed to look stupid, Gary!\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: What could go wrong?\nPatrick: What a surprise!\nSpongeBob: Hi.\nPatrick: Mom, Dad, meet my neighbor, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hi.\nMarty: Hello there!\nJanet: How do you do?\nSpongeBob: Hi.\nMarty: Put 'er there.\nDoll: Mama! Mama!\nPatrick: He means \"shake\".  No, SpongeBob, no! Shake hands!  No, SpongeBob! Grab my dad's hand.  Grab it with only one hand!  Good boy! Now move your arm up and down!\nJanet: So, SpongeBob. Do you live nearby?\nSpongeBob: Hi.\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob. Show them your house!  No, not your blouse! Your house!\nJanet: He lives in a fruit?\nMarty: That's unhealthy.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob! You wanna stay for dinner?\nMarty: Does he always do that after he eats?\nPatrick: Only on Wednesday.\nMarty: Uh, Patrick, I think your friend might be broken.\nPatrick: Yeah. And it would take more than some masking tape to fix that guy.\nMarty: Whoa! Is he gonna be okay?\nPatrick: Oh, that's nothing.  You should see him in the morning prancing around yelling \"I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!\"  He drives all the neighbors crazy!  Why, just the other day, our neighbor Squidward was--- . ---was really no help for him.  I mean, look at the way he's dressed. Only somebody with holes drilled in their head would wear that stuff! And how about his shape? I mean, I've heard of barrel-chested,  but never box-chested!  Hey, SpongeBob, do you have any mascara I could borrow?\nMarty: The boy wears make-up?\nJanet: What a card!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick! Patrick!\nPatrick: Aw, he said my name.\nMarty: Wow, how'd you train him to do that?\nPatrick: Ow! He bit me!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, meet me in the kitchen!\nPatrick: Oh, I guess the dummy wants to have a private conversation.  A dumb one!  So, what's on your mind? Oh, wait, I already know the answer. Nothing!  See, that's funny. 'Cause your dumb!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, could you let up on the insults just a little bit?\nPatrick: Oh, were those too complicated for you? I'll try dumb-ing them down a bit.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I get the feeling that you think I really am dumb!\nPatrick: That's just what I'd expect you to say. Dumb people are always blissfully unaware of how dumb they really are.\nSpongeBob: I'm only pretending to be dumb! It was our plan, remember?!\nPatrick: Oh, SpongeBob, if only you could see how stupid you sound right now, with your talk of imaginary plans. Tell you what. You've caught me at a good mood. I'll humor you. Go on, go out there and act \"smart\" for everyone.\nSpongeBob: Okay, I will!\nPatrick: And don't worry, I'll keep this warm for ya!\nSpongeBob: I have a confession to make. I lied about being stupid. I just acted like a fool so you would appreciate Patrick a little bit more. I know how to talk, and eat, and do laundry. I even separate the darks from the lights. So what do you say we start over and try again? Hi! My name is SpongeBob SquarePants. And I am not a dummy.\nMarty: Amazing! Three minutes in the kitchen and our son has taught him to talk in complete sentences.  Oh, good work, son!\nPatrick: It wasn't easy, dad.\nSpongeBob: But... but, but, but, but, but, but...\nJanet: It looks like it's time for your next lesson, young man!\nSpongeBob: Now, listen to me! I'm not dumb! I have a brain! See? Here's a picture of it!\nPatrick: That must be actual size.\nSpongeBob: No! It's normal size and fully functional, watch.  2 plus 2 equals 4.\nMarty: Hoho, son! You taught him math, too!\nSpongeBob: Noooo!\nMarty: And you taught him to sing!  Oh, now he's short-circuiting! You must have taught him a little too much.\nMarty: You know, son, I've always known that when it comes to brightness, well, you're about a three-watt. But this guy! He's a wet match in a dark cave. He makes phone operators seem smart!  But more importantly, son, he's shown me what a sharp, quick-witted boy you've become.  Ha! I feel like I'm really meeting you for the first time. Isn't that right, Janet?\nJanet: You bet, Marty!\nPatrick: Janet?! Marty?! Who are you people?!\nJanet: Marty, I'm scared!\nSquidward: Excuse me. Does this lovely couple belong to you? They've been standing outside my house saying \"Where's Patrick?\" all day! It's driving me nuts!\nPatrick: Mom! Dad!\nHerb: Wow, son! You actually recognized us this time.\nMargie: And you remembered to get dressed today!\nMarty: Oh, that's right, honey.

The voice of the people! \"Up with bubbles, down with air!\"  \"Nematodes are people too!\"  Ha, those nematodes... Here's one someone didn't finish! Squidward smells.  Good.  Hmm, what's this one?

I think I know what that means. That's one of those sentence enhancers.\nSpongeBob: Sentence enhancers?\nPatrick: You use them when you want to talk fancy. You just sprinkle it over anything you say, and Wham-o! You've got yourself a spicy sentence sandwich!\nSpongeBob: Oh, I get it! Let me try.  Hello, Patrick. Lovely  day we're having, isn't it?\nPatrick: Why, yes it is, SpongeBob. This  day is particularly  lovely!\nSpongeBob: How  right you are, Patrick!\nSpongeBob: Ooh, You're right, Patrick, my lips are tingling from the spiciness of this conversation.\nPatrick: Oh, mine, too!\nSpongeBob: It tingles when I laugh!\nSpongeBob: Hello, customers, nice  day we're having, uh?\nHarold: Did he just say?!\nPirate fish: Aye, he did.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, how the  are ya?\nPatrick: Pretty  good, SpongeBob.\nOld Man Jenkins: I thought this was a restaurant, not a gutter mouth convention.\nSpongeBob: Attention, customers, today's special is a  Krabby Patty served in a greasy  sauce and grilled to  perfection.

The Krusty Krab, she's empty!  All hands on deck! Batten the front doors! Brace the cash register! Break out the happy snacks! Squidward, where have all me money paying customers gone?\nSquidward: Apparently, the two barnacle-mouth brothers just learned a new word, and SpongeBob just said it over the intercom.\nMr. Krabs: Well, what was it? What'd he say?\nSquidward: Er...he said...um, well he said...\nMr. Krabs: Huh?  SpongeBob and friend! Front and center! Why, I oughta make the two of you paint the Krusty Krab for using such language!\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, we were only using our sentence enhancers.\nPatrick: Yeah, it's fancy talk.\nMr. Krabs: There ain't nothing fancy about that word!\nSpongeBob: You mean ?\nMr. Krabs: Yes, that one!  Now quit saying that!  It's a bad word!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Bad word?!\nMr. Krabs: Yes sirree, that's bad word number 11. In fact, there are 13 bad words you should never use.\nSquidward: Don't you mean there are only 7?\nMr. Krabs: Not if you're a sailor.\nSpongeBob: Wow, 13.\nPatrick: That's a lot of  bad words.\nMr. Krabs: Okay, boys. I want you to promise me you'll never use that word again.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We promise.\nSpongeBob: Gee, I'm glad Mr. Krabs told us that word we were using was a bad word!\nPatrick: Yeah, me too, because classy sophisticates like us shouldn't stain our lips with cursing.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, verily. Now, let's play a nice, wholesome game of Eels and Escalators.\nPatrick: Oh, boy, my favorite!\nSpongeBob: Come on, Gary needs a new pair of shoes!\nPatrick: Oh, eels.

There's no need for words like that.\nPatrick: I'm sorry, too, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Let's make a vow, Patrick. From this day forth, a foul word shall never pass our lips! We'll be good citizens, just like good ol' Mr. Krabs.\nPatrick: Agreed!\nMr. Krabs: All right, you two foul mouths.

And if you're going talk like sailors, then you're going work like sailors.\nMama Krabs: I guess you three scallywags have earned a glass of lemonade. Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga!  Yeeeoww!

Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image.  And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!\nJanitor: Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.\nSquidward: Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer.  Welcome to art class!\nNat: Oh, isn't this cooking? Sorry.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Squidward! Are you taking this art class, too?\nSquidward: SpongeBob? In art class? Wait! This is cooking! Come back! You gotta be kidding.\nSpongeBob: This is great! You and me in school together. So, where's the teacher?\nSquidward: You're looking at him.\nSpongeBob: You are the teacher? To my pupil? This isn't art class, it's Heaven.\nSquidward: Yeah. Grab a little piece of Heaven and let's get with it.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready, Mr. Tentacles.\nSquidward: So, you wanna be an artist, eh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, please.\nSquidward: Well, art is not all fun and games.  It's a lot of hard...  ...work. OK. First, repeat after me: I have no talent.\nSpongeBob: I have no talent.\nSquidward: Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Tentacles has all the talent.\nSquidward: If I'm lucky, some of Mr. Tentacles talent will rub off on me.\nSpongeBob: If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art.\nSquidward: Whatever. Ok. Since you're telling me you have no prior training, we'll have to start from square one. Or should I say circle one.  Am I going too fast for you SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: How's this, Squidward?\nSquidward: What the? How the? A perfect circle? Do it again. Show your process.\nSpongeBob: Well, first I draw this head.  Then I erase some of the more detailed features. And one, two, three. A circle, uhh, thingy.\nSquidward: Gimme that.  Forget the circles.\nSpongeBob: Ooh, nice one Squidward. Let me try.  Looky, Squidward. It's you and me playing leapfrog. That's you on the bottom.\nSquidward: Gimme that.  There is nothing artistic about leapfrog!  What are you doing, now?\nSpongeBob: I call it: Rippy Bits. You take a bunch of old ripped of paper, and make a new picture out of it. See? You're on top...this...time.\nSquidward: Do you want to learn art, or not?\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, I'll listen.\nSquidward: Alright, SpongeBob, pay close attention. Look at your marble. Visualize the sculpture within. And...\nSpongeBob: How's this Squidward?\nSquidward: It's beautiful!  I mean... this isn't a sculpture.  A good sculpture takes... more time. You can't just sculpt Willie-Nillie. You've got to go by the book. Follow the rules.  Otherwise, you'll never get passed Amateur Hour, here. Besides, you've got the nose wrong.  There, now it's art.\nSpongeBob: Ohhh, it's so obvious. I would've never thought of that. I'm sorry, Squidward. I came here to learn and I arrogantly shoved your lessons.  I'll never be a great artist like you! I don't deserve your tutoring. I don't deserve to be in your presence.  I don't even deserve to use your doors!\nMonty: Hello, there.\nSpongeBob: But I did deserve that.  I deserved that, too.  And I deserve this!\nMonty: Good day, sir.\nSquidward: Sorry, class dismissed. You're too late.\nMonty: Oh, I beg your pardon, but I've forgotten my manners. My name is Monty P. Moneybags.\nSquidward: The world famous art collector?\nMonty: The one and only.\nSquidward: Well, what are you doing here?\nMonty: I'm on a shopping spree. Buying art for my new museum.\nSquidward: Your search is over. I am Bikini Bottom's greatest artiste. I call this one: \"Squidward en repose\".\nMonty: I, uh, don't think that will fit in with the other pieces in my collection.\nSquidward: Why not?\nMonty: Because, it's an art collection.\nSquidward: How about this one? I call it: Bold and Brash.\nMonty: More like: Belongs in the Trash.\nJanitor: Sorry. I must've missed that one.\nMonty: Maybe I should be... huh? What is that?\nSquidward: Wait, wait. That's not uh, uh...\nMonty: Angelic form, amazing detail, perfect censorship. This is the work of a true genius. Hello? What this? This is the only flaw.  Ah, that's more like it. I simply must find the artist responsible. He shall have fame.\nSquidward: Fame.\nMonty: Fortune.\nSquidward: Fortune.\nMonty: Anything his heart desires.\nSquidward: Anything?  It's me. It's me. I'm responsible.\nMonty: I can see it now. Your name in the world's most prestigious museums. I'm gonna make you, immortal! Now, uh, help me get this in the car.\nSquidward: I could use a little help.  My fame! My fortune! My hair!\nMonty: Well, that's a bit a bad luck right there. But, this shouldn't be a problem for an artist of your magnitude. You can whip up another one.\nSquidward: Yeah, no problem. You know, between you and me, this isn't my best work. Why don't you come back tomorrow and I'll have something that will really knock your socks off.\nMonty: Between you and me, I'm not wearing socks.\nSquidward: Yeah, no socks. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye.  I gotta find SpongeBob!  SpongeBob...SpongeBob? SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Go away, Squidward. I don't deserve your kindness.\nSquidward: Hey, cheer up. I have decided to give you another chance. Why, with a great teacher like me, anything is possible.\nSpongeBob: Don't look at me Squidward. Don't look at my shame.  These hands weren't meant to create. They only destroy. I can't look at them.\nSquidward: Aww, c'mon SpongeBob. You've got yourself a pair of yellow dandies here. With my help, we'll turn them into tools of beauty.\nSpongeBob: Really?\nSquidward: Really!\nSpongeBob: Really?\nSquidward: Really!\nSpongeBob: Really?\nSquidward: Really.\nSpongeBob: Wow.  Really?\nSquidward: Let's go.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, look. It's ol' Bold and Brash!\nSquidward: Gimme that.  Ok, SpongeBob. Just do what you did before.\nSpongeBob: I... can't!\nSquidward: Ah, ah. Wait, wait. Let me help. Let's start with the circle again.\nSpongeBob: I did it, Squidward.\nSquidward: Huh? But, but, what about the head...and the erasing, and the, the...\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Squidward. That stuff's not in the book.\nSquidward: Uhh...  How about this, huh? Remember?\nSpongeBob: That's not in the book, either.\nSquidward: Forget about the book!  Ha! Look at all this mess SpongeBob.  What do all these little bits of paper make you want to do?\nSpongeBob: Wait, I know this. Oh, wait, I think I got it.  Ta-da!\nSquidward: OK, SpongeBob. Let's just move onto the marble.\nSpongeBob: First, an artist must concentrate and visualize his concept.\nSquidward: Now you've got it.\nSpongeBob: I've gotta embrace the marble!\nSquidward: Right.\nSpongeBob: I've gotta sniff the marble!\nSquidward: Well, uh, ok.\nSpongeBob: I've gotta lick the marble!\nSquidward: Uhh...\nSpongeBob: I've gotta wash the marble! I've gotta date the marble!  I've gotta be the marble! I've got it! I have see the sculpture within.\nSquidward: Here you go, buddy.\nSpongeBob: With this tool, I shall give birth to art.\nSquidward: Oh, boy.\nSpongeBob: But, one more thing.  There. Now it's art. Well, what do you think, Squidward? Just take it all in for a moment. Let it soak in.  It looks like the excitement of my artistic triumph is too much for Squidward. Oh, well, back to the dump.  \u266aTo the dump, to the dump, to the dump, dump dump. To the dump, to the dump, To the dump, dump dump. \u266a\nMonty: I'm here for the... what the? Who is responsible for this?\nSquidward: As of now, it's his responsibility!  Good day to you, sir!\nMonty: You, sir, are the greatest artist who ever lived!\n","39a\nJellyfish Hunter\nFrench Narrator: Ahh, another beautiful day in Bikini Bottom's own Jellyfish Fields. An untamed world of natural order where the little jellyfish jellies roam free across the salty seascape. And where there is jellyfish, there is the Jellyfish Hunter.\nSpongeBob: La la la la, la la la la la!  You're my twelfth catch of the day. I'm gonna call you \"Twelvey.\"  Coochie coochie coo!  Bye, Twelvey!  Oh! It's you!  Well, it's just you and me again, I've caught and named every jellyfish in Jellyfish Fields at least once. Except you, No Name.\nSpongeBob: Gotcha!  Barnacles! How'd he do that? Someday, I'll catch old No Name.\nSpongeBob: I'm going on my lunch break, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: You've got 5 minutes!\nSpongeBob: Wow! One more minute than yesterday!

I've got to tell someone about this. \u266aHey all you people! Hey all you people! Hey all you people, won't you listen to me?

Yeah... Thank you!\u266a\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, who's playing Squidward's records again?\nSpongeBob: No one, Mr. Krabs. I was just sharing my jellyfish jelly with the customers.

How's about you go catch me some of those little moneyfish?\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy. Getting paid to jellyfish. That's my life's dream!\nMr. Krabs: Well, keep dreaming.  This'll be on your time.\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir!\nMr. Krabs: Now go get me some jellyfish, and make it  ...quick. Uhh, SpongeBob? We're gonna need more than one puny jellyfish.\nSpongeBob: But, sir, how many jellyfish do you need?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, we have a whole ecosystem full of hungry paying customers.  Oh no! Don't tell me! You've stopped caring for the customer!\nSpongeBob: No! Never!\nMr. Krabs: Then go out there and get me some more jellies!\nSpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs.

Are we gonna let some pretender take away what belongs to the Krusty Krab?\nSpongeBob: No!\nPlankton: Then get mean!\nPatrick: I'm mean!\nMr. Krabs: Get angry!\nSpongeBob: I'm angry!\nPlankton: Now get out there!\nMr. Krabs: And win...\nPlankton: That...\nMr. Krabs: Medal!\nHuge Fish: Ahhh.\nJohnny: Our first event, the deep fry pole vault.\nMr. Krabs: Win this one for the Krusty Krab.\nSpongeBob: For the Krusty Krab!\nPlankton: Win this one because I told you to.\nPatrick: Because you told me to!\nVendor: Fish sticks! Get your fish sticks here!\nJohnny: The next event: the chocolate high dive.\nSpongeBob: Make way for the real fry cook, Patrick.\nJohnny: For his dive, SpongeBob will be attempting a full banana fudge pop with two sticks.\nJohnny: And now, absolute silence.\nSpongeBob: I scream for ice cream!\nJohnny: Perfect entry! And toasted almonds? That's unexpected.\nJohnny: He stuck it!\nJohnny: And just look at that even coating.\nSpongeBob: Top that, Pinky.\nPlankton: Almonds? Curse him, that's good. But perhaps a bit too highbrow for this crowd. He thinks he's better than them!\nPlankton: Better than you!\nPlankton: Now get up there and show him how the common man prepares his frozen dairy treats!\nJohnny: Patrick will be resurrecting an old favorite. The single scoop strawberry cone with a chocolate dip.\nJohnny: Just look at that concentration.\nJohnny: Ooh, a little shaky on that entry.\nJohnny: But just look at that form!\nPatrick: Take that, yellow boy!\nSpongeBob: Laugh while you can, Pinky. It's not over yet.\nPatrick: That's what you think, but it's not over yet.\nJohnny: It's not over yet! With the score tied, we go to our final event! Bun wrestling. Who will take home the gold?

Here's your change.\nMr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward!\nSquidward: What?\nMr. Krabs: What's with all this \"change\" nonsense?\nSpongeBob: Over and under, grab the end, put it through here, up and around, round the horn, bring it back home.\nMr. Krabs: Hmm? SpongeBob! I ain't paying you to play dress up!  Breathe on your own time. I don't pay you to breathe.\nSquidward: You hardly pay us at all!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, that reminds me. I got something for you.\nSquidward: Ah, yes! Our meager restitution.  Ah, the sweet smell of payday.  Huh?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, sorry, that's me dry cleaning.  Here's your check.\nMr. Krabs: And here's yours, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: I can't accept your money, Mr. Krabs.  Grilling is my passion!\nSquidward: What is this!?!  You're making me pay you to stand at the cash register? What is the meaning of this? Have you gone off the deep end?\nMr. Krabs: There's going to be a few changes around here. Every time I catch you two goofing off, I'm gonna charge you for it.\nSpongeBob: 18... 19... and... 20. Here you go, Mr. K. I think this should cover all my nonsense. Oh, and here's an extra fifty cents for when I was tying my shoe.\nSquidward: Uh, SpongeBob? What do you think you're doing?\nSpongeBob: I'm just giving Mr. Krabs the money I owe him.\nSquidward: Well, I'm not paying that cheapskate Krabs one cent, and I suggest you do the same.\nSpongeBob: Why?\nSquidward: We've got to unite as workers and demand the respect we deserve from the boss! In fact, you and I should go on strike!\nSpongeBob: Wow! You and me go on strike?\nSquidward: Sure! After all, you like your job, right?\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSquidward: And you want to keep working here, right?\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSquidward: And while you work here, you expect to be treated fairly, right?\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSquidward: Then let's go on strike!\nSpongeBob: Yay!

Noo...  No! Squidward! You didn't tell me I was gonna get fired! Without the Krusty Krab, I-I-I...  Oh, Squidward, could you hold me? I think I'm gonna be sick.\nSquidward: SpongeBob!  News flash, SpongeBob! I got fired, too!  This is exactly why we need to go on strike.  He can't treat us like this anymore!  He owes us for all the precious, irretrievable moments we've wasted in this trash heap.  Soon, he'll realize he needs us more than we need him. We are workers united!  Ahem.\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\nSquidward: Just do exactly as I say, SpongeBob, and in no time, you'll have your job back and more.\nSpongeBob: And more?\nSquidward: Alright, SpongeBob, now listen up. I'm going to have to teach you how to strike. First, we must get rid of our uniforms,  they are a symbol of our oppression. I want you to throw your hat on the ground like so.  Now, stomp it into the dust! Your turn, SpongeBob.  That's the idea. Now, throw it on the ground.\nSpongeBob: I can't do it, Squidward. This hat is my friend! It never oppressed me.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you're pathetic. Look, I threw my hat to the ground.\nOfficer John: Aha! A confession! Next time, think before you litter.\nSquidward: Okay, pay attention, SpongeBob. Now we're going to make picket signs. This is a very important part of striking.\nSpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?\nSquidward: Not a picket fence, you ding-dong. Picket sign!\nSpongeBob: How's this?\nSquidward: ...No.  This is a picket sign: Krusty Krab Unfair. Short, sweet, and to the point.\nSpongeBob: How about this, Squidward?\nSquidward: SpongeBob, it's \"unfair,\" not \"funfair\"!\nSandals: A funfair? Where? I could go for some fun.\nSpongeBob: At the Krusty Krab.\nSandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go to the fun fair!\nSpongeBob: Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!\nTeenage Fry Cook: What the heck does that mean?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Squidward told me to yell it at people.\nTeenage Fry Cook: Then you must be SpongeBob SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: Yep!\nTeenage Fry Cook: Dude, you are like a fry cook legend! Will you sign my spatula?\nSpongeBob: Anything for an aspiring fry cook.  So, did you come down to help out the cause?\nTeenage Fry Cook: No, I came to take your job.\nTeenage Fry Cook: Hey, thanks, dude!\nSquidward: Attention, SpongeBob! You are a terrible striker!  You just let your replacement cross our picket line without so much as a single threat.\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward.  How about I try the signs again?\nSquidward: Forget the signs! I've got something for you to do. Go stand over there.\nSpongeBob: Like this, Squidward?\nSquidward: Almost. A little more to the right. And... perfect.  Attention, people of Bikini Bottom! You have been cheated and lied to!\nMiss Shell: I knew it!\nSquidward: The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs!\nArchie: Hey, what's that guy talking about?\nFrancis: I don't know, but he's got a megaphone.\nSquidward: We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity!\nSpongeBob: Gee, I don't know what Squidward's talking about, but he sure sounds convincing.\nSquidward: With your support, we will send the hammer of the people's will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs' house of servitude!\nBilly (lime fish): Wow, all this supporting is making me hungry.\nSandals: Hey, everybody! Let's go get a Krabby Patty.\nSquidward: Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification.\nSpongeBob: That was a great speech, Squidward. You practically had them eating out of your hands.\nMr. Krabs: But they didn't, did they, Mr. Squidward? 'Cause they were too busy eating out of mine. I wish you two had gone on strike earlier. Thanks for attracting all these paying customers with all your signage and your sloganeering!\nSpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs. You've gone too far this time. You can pick on me, but Squidward is a great leader. We are workers united! We're tired of your smelly greed! And we're gonna saw all your tables, and we're gonna smash stuff with the people's hammer. And we're gonna... we're gonna... Squidward, what was that other part?\nSquidward: Dismantle your oppressive establishment?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, that, too!\nSpongeBob: And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!\nSquidward: On strike with SpongeBob... forever?!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. I bet old man Krabs is gonna break any day.  Eh, Squidward? Eh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?  Nyeh, Squidward? Nyeh, Squidward?\nSquidward: I gotta beg Mr. Krabs for my job back and put an end to this nightmare!\nMr. Krabs: Oh! Uh, evening, Mr. Squidward. Uh... I was just in the neighborhood and I, uh... thought I'd drop by to... beg you to come back to work! The Krusty Krab is a wreck! I'm ruined without you and the little yellow guy.  The teenagers I hired is ruining the place! And the worst part is, they won't leave me alone!\nTeenagers: Alright, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: See what I mean?  Squidward, please! You gotta come back!\nSquidward: You'll give us anything we want?\nMr. Krabs: Yes, anything. So what do you say, Mr. Squidward?\nSquidward: Your story breaks my heart, Mr. Krabs. Why don't we take a little walk and, uh... discuss my terms?\nMr. Krabs: I got a bad feeling in the pit of me wallet.\nSpongeBob: Gee, being on strike with Squidward sure is a kick. Squidward's words are still buzzing around in my head like an angry jellyfish. Squidward was right! I can't just sit here, it's time for action!  I will restore the working man to his rightful glory. I will dismantle this oppressive establishment board by board!  I will saw the tables of tyranny in half. Gnaw at the ankles of big business!  Squidward will be so proud!\nMr. Krabs: Well, Squidward, those were intense negotiations.\nSquidward: I'm glad you saw it our way, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Now I can fire them teenagers and get me two golden boys back. Well, see you at work!\nSquidward: S-Sp-SpongeBob! W-W-What have you done?\nSpongeBob: I did exactly as you said, Squidward. I dismantled the establishment! Now we'll get our jobs back for sure.\nMr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob!\nBoth: Yes, Mr. Krabs?\nSpongeBob: Here it comes!\nMr. Krabs: In order to pay off these damages, you two are gonna work for me forever!\nSpongeBob: Ya-hoo! The strike worked, Squidward!

You'll never get a cent out of me!  Never! I'd rather that worm come in here right now and eat you all alive!  Sorry.\nSandy: Aw, shucks. I don't want your money. I was just playing up the drama of the moment, is all.  Nope. I'm not gonna take that spineless critter down for nothing, 'cause this is personal. Look. My tail's gone!  Varmint must've got it while I had my back turned, the coward!  I am gonna get back what's mine!\nSpongeBob: What? But, Sandy, you don't know what you're up against. We're talking about an Alaskan... Bull... Worm!\nSandy: Well, I don't know nothing about Alaska, but looky here.  Back in Texas I wrangled bulls, and I wrangled worms.  Far as I'm concerned, doing 'em both together just saves rope. Now I'm gonna go kick me some worm tail! Yee-haw!\nSpongeBob: But, Sandy, you don't know!\nSandy: Don't worry, SpongeBob. I won't be long.\nSpongeBob: Sandy! Sandy!\nMr. Krabs: Go get 'em, Sandy!

What you think is big and what I think is big are two totally different \"big\"s. Besides, he's got my tail. I can't take that sitting down.\nSpongeBob: Okay, but what if the worm didn't take your tail?\nSandy: If that worm ain't got my tail, who does?\nSpongeBob: Um, I do?\nSandy: You do? Where?\nSpongeBob: Um... in my pocket.\nSandy: Well, why didn't you just say so? Give it here! Come on!  SpongeBob, that's a paper clip and a piece of string.\nSpongeBob: No, it's not.

'blargen-fezibble-nukhip'?\nSandy: Well, I gotta admit, that's slowin' me down, but I'm still going for him!\nSpongeBob: You know, tails are so overrated. Let's just forget about it and go home.  I've got ice cream! With nuts...  Sandy, this is your pappy speaking, and I forbid you to go after this worm! Y'all come back here, young lady!\nSandy: You ain't my pa!\nSpongeBob: Sandy, if you want to get to that worm, you're gonna have to go through me!  Sandy, no! I can't let you! I'm not gonna let you get killed. If you find him, you'll get eaten for sure!\nSandy: Ain't no way some dumb old sea worm's gonna make a meal of me. I'm too Texas tough!\nSpongeBob: No, not tough enough. Not tough enough!\nSandy: SpongeBob, quit your worrying. I can take care of myself. After all, who's the strongest critter in Bikini Bottom?\nSpongeBob: You are.\nSandy: And who put the hi-yah, hi, ho, \"K\" in karate?\nSpongeBob: You did.\nSandy: And who saves your yellow backside from certain destruction on a regular basis?\nSpongeBob: You do.\nSandy: Right. And I can handle your little bull worm too, 'cause I am the best there is!

I got him, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Sandy...?\nSandy: Boy, howdy. This critter put up some sort of fight. But I'm from Texas, and as you can see, no worm is a match for me. I even found my tail!\nSpongeBob: That's not the worm.\nSandy: Pardon?\nSpongeBob: That's not the worm. That's his tongue.\nSandy: Ohhhh. This is the tongue, and... the whole thing... is the... worm.  RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIFE!!!!\nSpongeBob: So what's the plan, Sandy?\nSandy: Run faster!\nSpongeBob: I could've thought of that.

Where the sun is hot and the sunbathers are oh so cool.\nSpongeBob: What a beautiful day.\nPatrick: You said it, pal.\nSpongeBob: Can you believe that sun?\nPatrick: I could look at it all day.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick?\nPatrick: What?\nSpongeBob: Nothing.\nPatrick: So, how's that tan coming?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Let me check.  Looking good. How's yours?\nPatrick: Just a minute, Ah!  I could have sworn I was laying on my back.\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's Larry, the lifeguard.\nNancy Suzy Fish: Mr. Lifeguard, can I feel your muscle?\nLarry: Sure. Don't scratch the paint.\nScooter: Lifeguard, hows\u2019s the tubage?\nLarry: Gnarly, dudes!\nScooter and friends: All right, yeah! Woohoo!\nElderly Man: Lifeguard, can you point out the snack bar?\nLarry: Right over there. But you guys are way too old and unsightly for my beach. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.\nElderly Woman: So polite.\nElderly Man: Just like we raised him.\nSpongeBob: What a guy. Is it any wonder he's so popular? Just imagine if I were a lifeguard.  That would be so cool.\nPatrick: Oh, what do you want to be a lifeguard for? Nobody really likes those guys.  Being a lifeguard is so dumb. All they do is blow, blow, blow on their stupid whistles, rub, rub, rub that white stuff on their noses and show off their gross misshapen bodies!\nNat: Dude, put that thing away. There are, like, children here.\nPatrick: I'm going to the snack bar.\nSpongeBob: Who needs to be a lifeguard? I'm cool.  I'm every bit as cool as Larry. And if I'm not, let me be struck by...  ...a flying ice cream truck.  AND LIVE!\nLarry: Please do not land flying ice cream trucks on the bathers.  SpongeBob, you okay?  Hey! I didn't know you were a lifeguard.\nSpongeBob: Lifeguard?\nLarry: The nose.\nSpongeBob: White stuff. You think I'm a lifeguard?\nLarry: Sure, there\u2019s no hiding the lifeguard look, SpongeBob, and you've got it.\nSpongeBob: You really think so?\nLarry: You bet I do. Say, we're a little shorthanded around here. How would you like to work the beach?\nSpongeBob: (high voice) I'd love it!\nLarry: Alright.  Leave that on the bench, Kahuna. Hey, Annette, come here.  I want you to meet my buddy, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Hi.\nLarry: Hey, guy's a lifeguard.\nSpongeBob: It works.  Woohoo! That was the greatest, Larry.\nLarry: Yeah. Say, how'd you like to take the second shift?\nSpongeBob: By myself?\nLarry: Only if you think you're ready.\nSpongeBob: I'm not just ready.  I'm ready, Freddie.\nLarry: It's Larry. Well, I guess I'll just...\nFish #2: Help, help!  Help, help, help!\nLarry: We've got a sinker! SpongeBob, let me take this. I haven't seen any action all day.\nSpongeBob: Action?\nFish #2: Please help, please help!\nLarry: Breathe, darn you!\nFish #3: That's the last time I read and swim! You saved my life!\nLarry: Don't mention it. It's all part of the job.  You know, SpongeBob, the babes and the big chair are great, but the best part is knowing you're the only thing that stands between these good people...  ...and a watery grave. And that's what its all about.  Their lives are in your hands now, \u2018cause I got a date with the tanning booth.  See ya.\nSpongeBob: But I...  ...can't swim. Oh, if I'd known being a lifeguard meant guarding their lives, I would never have said yes.  Maybe nothing will go wrong. Then when Larry comes back, I'll tell him I'm not interested. Besides, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?  Emergency! Everybody out of the water! Hurry! Emergency! Out of the water!  Emergency!  Uhh... there are sharks in there!\nFather Shark: Hey, that's my family you're talking about!\nSpongeBob: Uhh... sea monster!\nSea Monster: You know, we sea monsters have made great strides in the fields of science and literature.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, somebody went?  No, don't go!  Free ice cream!  Plenty for everybody. One for you, one for you... okay, everybody got one?  A-ha, now I got ya! Now, you all have to wait one hour before you go swimming.  But just so you're not tempted...  Ladies and gentlemen, the goo lagoon is closed.\nScooter: We like Larry better.\nSpongeBob: Does Larry ever give you  free ice cream?\nPatrick: Ice cream?  Did somebody say ice cream?  Where is it? Is it here?  Huh? Ice cream, yay!  Cramp!\nFish #4: Holy cow, somebody's drowning!\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, that's not possible. The lagoon is closed.\nScooter: Dude, get your butt in the water!\nSpongeBob: If there was anyone in there, we'd hear them.\nPatrick: Help, help!  I can't swim!\nSpongeBob: Somebody would be screaming that they're drowning.\nPatrick: I'm drowning! I'm drowning!\nSpongeBob: They would have to have crossed the line.\nPatrick: I'm drowning \u2018cause I crossed the line!\nSpongeBob: Okay, I'll take a look, but just to prove to you that...  ...PATRICK ISN'T DROWNING!\nPatrick: Can't swim! Butt hurts! Ice cream!\nSpongeBob: Hold on, Patrick!  I'm coming!\nPatrick: Help, help!\nSpongeBob: Don't move!  Catch this!\nHarold: Quit fooling around, man. Get in the water.\nPatrick: Help, help!\nSpongeBob: Oh, what am I going to do? Got to think.  Gotta think. Gotta run around and think. Gotta run around and think at the same time. Gotta think, gotta have a plan. Gotta think, think, think.  I've got it!  Patrick can't drown if there isn't any water.  Well, you're safe now, Patrick.\nPatrick: Help, I'm drowning! I've got butt cramps! I want ice cream and now it\u2019s dark!  Help, help! Help me, I'm drowning! Help!\nGus: To us.\nSpongeBob: Sorry. Here's your hot dog.  Okay, Patrick, here I come.  Come, come round, Pat. Here I am.\nPatrick: Oh, sorry.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Help! Help us! We're drowning!\nSpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick!\nPatrick: Goodbye, ice cream!\nLarry: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Larry?\nLarry: You're not a lifeguard, are you?\nSpongeBob: No, Larry.\nLarry: Let's go, guys.  Very good. You fellas are learning fast.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Ow, butt cramps!\nPatrick: And I still don't have my ice cream.\n","42a\nClub SpongeBob\nSquidward: There's my hat... and there's that, and here we go.\nSpongeBob: Wey, wook. It's Widward!\nSquidward: What?\nSpongeBob: Widward's woing to work.\nPatrick: Where does he work? Wat the Wusty Wab?\nSquidward: What's that supposed to be\u2014 some kind of stupid secret code?\nSpongeBob: We can't tell you 'cause you're not a member of the club.\nSquidward: Oh, yeah? What does it take to be a member, besides being a moron?  Moron...  as a requirement.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, but you couldn't get in even if you tried!\nSquidward: Huh? Well, I'll have you know that I am a member of over 20 different exclusive clubs all across the sea bottom!\nPatrick: What did he say?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Something about his nose?\nPatrick: Squidward, you and your nose will definitely not fit in!\nSquidward: Oh, what do you two zeros know about fitting in?  Why, you should be begging me to join!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward, no, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, stop, please, please! Stop, Squidward! You can't join! You can't join! Can't join! You can't get in!\nSquidward: Well, this is stupid. There's no room up here!\nPatrick: That's what we've been trying to tell you!\nSpongeBob: We've been stuck up here for three days.\nPatrick: We told you you wouldn't fit in.\nSpongeBob: Well, since you're here, Squidward, we'll give you the new member initiation. Are you ready, Patrick?\nPatrick: Ready!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Welcome to our club! Welcome to our club! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squidward! Welcome Squid...!\nSquidward: Shut your half-wit pieholes!  I do not now, nor will I ever, want to be a member of your stupid club!\nNancy: Whoa!\nFrank: Make a wish, honey.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Again! Oh, yeah! Again!\nSquidward: Oh, no. That didn't just happen. Please tell me that didn't happen!\nPatrick: What happened?\nSquidward: Where are we? We're lost! There's no way out! Stuck... in the middle of nowhere... with SpongeBob and Patrick!\nSquidward: Oh, why must every 11 minutes of my life be filled with misery? Why-y-y-y?!\nSpongeBob: Oh, cheer up, Squid. It could be worse.\nPatrick: Yeah. You could be bald and have a big nose.\nSquidward: Well... this is the end.\nSpongeBob: No, it's not, Squidward.\nPatrick: It's not?\nSpongeBob: Come on, guys, we're gonna be fine!  As long as we stick together. Remember, we're a club!\nSpongeBob: And besides, we have this!\nSquidward: What's that?\nPatrick: Ohhh! The Magic Conch Shell! Ask it something! Ask it something!\nSpongeBob: Magic Conch Shell, will I ever get married?\nMagic Conch: Maybe someday.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Oooohhhh!\nSquidward: You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?\nSpongeBob: Squidward, we must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch. The club always takes its advice before we do anything.\nPatrick: The shell knows all!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Magic Conch Shell, what do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?\nMagic Conch: Nothing.\nPatrick: The shell has spoken!\nSquidward: Nothing?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!\nSquidward: I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!\nSquidward: All right, all right, all right! I don't need your help. I'm gonna find my way back to sanity!  But don't you two sad clowns come crying to me when your circus tent comes crashing down! Sad clowns...  sad...  clowns.  What was that? I was already here! Which way do I go? Oh, I'm lost!  Ohh... I'm hopelessly lost! I'll never get out of here!  Huh?  I'm free! Take that, SpongeBob and Patrick!  Huh? Ohhh...  there's no way out of here.  How's it going over there at Club Shell-for-Brains? Mmm-mmm-mmm. I am hungry. I wonder what's on the menu for Club Squidward tonight?  Ah...  Doesn't that smell good, SpongeBob? You haven't eaten in days.  How about you, Patrick? A big boy's gotta eat. Well, you can't have any.  And do you know why, SpongeBob? Because your club president is a shell!  If you had listened to me you'd have food, shelter, and a roaring fire. But instead you listened to a talking clam...  that tells you nothing!  As if the answers to solve all your problems will fall right out of the sky!  Fall right out of the sky!\nScooter: Dude, we're falling right out the sky! We gotta drop the load!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Praise the Magic Conch!\nSquidward: Uh, hey, uh, SpongeBob... that sure is a lot of food you got there.\nSpongeBob: It's a gift from the Magic Conch.\nSquidward: Everything sure looks delicious.  Oh! Smoked sausages! My favorite!  Uh, hey, uh,  SpongeBob, I...you know I was just kidding around earlier and-and-and I-I-I mean I'm... I'm still part of the club, right? And... and-and-and-and-and after all, the-the club's gotta stick together, and I-I mean... you know, I-I, um...\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\nSquidward: Umm...uh..yeah?\nSpongeBob: Once a member, always a member!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: To the club!\nSquidward: Yeah.  Now, uh, if you'll excuse me...  All right... What shall I eat first? The spaghetti, the turkey, the soup, the canned meat?\nSpongeBob: Why don't you ask... the Magic Conch, Squidward?\nSquidward: Oh, yeah, like that'll happen. Right after I consult the Magic Toenail.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, are you questioning the authority of the Magic Conch? The conch is the one who gave us this banquet. This copyrighted conch is the cornerstone of our organization.\nPatrick: Maybe he's not a brother.\nSquidward: Hey, y-you guys have it all wrong. I-I love this, uh, piece of plastic.  Uh, hello there. Magic Conch, uh, I was wondering... uh, should I have the spaghetti or the turkey?\nMagic Conch: Neither.\nSquidward: Oh. Then how about the soup?\nMagic Conch: I don't think so.\nSquidward: Could I have anything to eat?\nMagic Conch: No.\nSquidward: No?! What do you mean no? I'm starving here!\nPatrick: Here, let me try. Magic Conch, could Squidward have some of this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?\nMagic Conch: No.\nPatrick: Hmm...  Could I have this yummy, delicious, super-terrific sandwich?\nMagic Conch: Yes.\nPatrick: All right!  Sorry, Squidward.\nSquidward: Give me that!  Could I have something to eat?\nMagic Conch: No.\nSquidward: Could I have something to eat?\nMagic Conch: No.\nSquidward: Could I have something to eat?\nMagic Conch: No.\nSquidward: Can't you say anything else but no?\nMagic Conch: Try asking again.\nSquidward: Can I have something to eat?\nMagic Conch: No.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, are you all right?\nPatrick: Maybe we should ask the shell if he's okay.\nKelp Forest Ranger: Hello? Anyone there? Hello? Hello?!  Do you folks need some help?\nSquidward: I'm saved!  You don't know how happy I am to see you. I have been stranded out here for weeks with-with-with these two barnacle heads and their Magic Conch Shell!\nKelp Forest Ranger: Magic... Conch Shell?  You mean like this?!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: The Magic Conch! A club member!\nSquidward: Abra.\nKelp Forest Ranger: My conch told me to come save you guys.\nSpongeBob, Patrick and Kelp Forest Ranger: Hooray for the magic conches!\nKelp Forest Ranger: All right, Magic Conch... what do we do now?\nMagic Conch: Nothing.\nSpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger: All hail the Magic Conch!\nSquidward: All hail the magic conch!\n","42b\nMy Pretty Seahorse\nNarrator: Ah, springtime in Bikini Bottom.

A quick survey of his environment...  ...and he knows that.\nPatrick: It's spring!\nNarrator: The starfish then sheds his winter coat  and stores it away safe for winter.\nSpongeBob: I'd better call the doctor, 'cause I've got spring fever! Good morning, little flowers.  Hello, Squidward, isn't it a lovely day?\nSquidward: Huh?\nSpongeBob: Have you said hello to the flowers yet?\nSquidward: Good morning, flowers.\nSpongeBob: Gosh, I didn't know Squidward had hay fever. I'll do him the kindness and plant him some hypoallergenic flowers.  You're on your way. I bet you're thirsty.  Huh?  I'm not taking my eyes off you.\nNarrator: Three days later...\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hi, Patrick!  How does this keep happening?  Hi.  She's beautiful!  What a magnificent seahorse. I shall tame her. Who knows what we can accomplish?  Because of her mysterious behavior, I have decided to name her Mystery. Hmmm, now that I think of it, she is very graceful and majestic. Perhaps I should name her Grace, or Majesty, or Debbie.  She must have spotted my floral bookmark!  She's coming this way. That's it, girl. Don't be afraid. I'm just a talking sponge, is all.  Gosh, Mystery, that was the greatest day of my life. Do you think we'll be friends forever?  I'll take that as a yes!\nSquidward: What the...?\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Still riding a machine to work, I see!\nSquidward: Don't say anything, Squidward, remember your karma.\nSpongeBob: Whoa, girl. Now you wait out here until I'm done with work. See you at the end of my shift.\nScooter: Hey, look, Mr. Krabs put in a kiddy ride!\nMartin: Why doncha try it out?\nScooter: I can't find the coin slot. Here it is!\nMartin: Help! Kiddy ride on the loose!\nMr. Krabs: What's with all the ruckus?  A monster scaring away me customers!\nSpongeBob: That's not a monster, Mr. Krabs, it's a horse. She's my friend. Her name is Mystery.\nMr. Krabs: You're a mystery, SpongeBob.  Get rid of it.\nSpongeBob: Huh? Please, Mr. Krabs, let her stay! She won't hurt nobody nohow!\nMr. Krabs: It's either you or Mystery.\nSpongeBob: I knew I should've named her Debbie.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, thanks for finally getting rid of that horse!\nSpongeBob: You're welcome, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Now, if we could only get rid of Squidward.\nSpongeBob: Good one, sir.  Ha! It worked, girl!  We'll just keep you here until Patrick finishes that stable I asked him to build.  Only eight more hours.\nNarrator: Twelve seconds later...\nSpongeBob: No, Mystery, you can't come out yet. If old man Krabs sees you, I'll lose my job.  Wait a second. I bet you're hungry. How \u2018bout some lunch?  Shhh! Girl, you got to be quiet or...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  What was that? Is that horse in here?\nSpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs. I was just practicing my imitation of Mystery. Weesnaw.\nMr. Krabs: Well, keep working on it! That was terrible!\nSpongeBob: That was close.  From now on, no more hijinks. Order up!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, where's my order?\nSpongeBob: Did you look under the tray?\nSquidward: No I didn't, sorry.  SpongeBob, could you just get my order?\nSpongeBob: They vanished. Squidward, do you think the Krusty Krab is haunted? What if they come for me next? I gotta get out of here!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, there's no ghosts!\nSpongeBob: Oh.\nSquidward: In case you've forgotten, here's how things work. I order the food, you cook the food, the customer gets the food.  We do that for forty years and then we die. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, what do you say?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you Squidward. I'll be right back.\nSquidward: What's that?\nSpongeBob: Don't tell Mr. Krabs! I got it all under control!  Now then, you were saying?\nSquidward: Just get my order.\nSpongeBob: You got it, Squidward?  Ghosts.  Mystery, you ate my hat!  Mystery, you ate my spatula! You ate all the Krabby Patties! You ate the stove! You ate Old Man Jenkins!\nOld Man Jenkins: I don't want to be a burden.\nSquidward: Folks, we have a minor situation going on in the kitchen.\nThaddeus: Where's our food?\nFred: I'm so hungry!\nTina: This is my only lunch hour!\nTom: Where's Old Man Jenkins?\nSquidward: Take it easy, the food's no good here, anyway.\nMr. Krabs: Squidward, what's going on in here?\nSquidward: Why don't you ask CowBob RanchPants and his faithful companion Sir Eats-A-Lot?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's the meaning of all these nicknames? Davey H. Jones!\nSpongeBob: Mystery got a belly-ache from eating Krabby Patties, so I made her a bicarbonate of soda.\nOld Man Jenkins: What did I miss?\nMr. Krabs: So, my eyes are correct! You still have that horse even when I ordered you to get rid of it! Well, now I'm going to get rid of it once and for all!\nSpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs! Don't make me give up Mystery! I know you think she's just a horse, but she's more than that, I tell you. She listens to me. She understands everything I say and I understand her! She's my best friend!\nSquidward: Hey, who left this bowl of onions here?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, your story has touched me heart. Believe it or not, I know what it's like to give up a best friend.\nSpongeBob: You do?\nMr. Krabs: I was five years old and me father gave me a dollar. I loved that dollar. Loved it like a brother. Me and that dollar went everywhere together.\nSpongeBob: What happened to the dollar, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: And one day at the beach, it was so hot and I was so thirsty! I spent it on a soda!  My best friend!\nSquidward: What? Would you get out of here?\nMr. Krabs: The point is, son, sometimes, you have to set things free even though it's hard.  Look at her. She misses the great outdoors, the wide-open spaces, the rolling green pastures. The kitchen is no place for a live horse.\nSpongeBob: Alright, Mr. Krabs, I understand.\nNat Peterson: Hey!\nSpongeBob: Okay, girl, you're free to go.  I can't keep you anymore.  I know it's hard for you to understand, but Mr. Krabs is right. You belong in the wild.  Well, what are you waiting for? Can't you see I don't want you anymore?  Just get out of here, you stupid, dumb animal!  Well, she's gone and I'll never see her again.\nMr. Krabs: It's okay, son. You did the proper thing. She's free now and we have no right to separate that wild animal from her natural habitat.\nSquidward: Hey, Mr. Krabs, looks like old Mystery had an after-dinner salad!\nMr. Krabs: Get that horse!\nSpongeBob: Mystery!\nMr. Krabs: Come back!\nSpongeBob: Mystery!

It's disgusting. They're sickening. I hate Krabby Patties.\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squidward.\nSquidward: Good what?\nSpongeBob: Like you don't know.  Saying,  \"I hate Krabby Patties.\"  That's hilarious! Everyone loves Krabby Patties.\nSquidward: Yeah, well, not me.\nSpongeBob: You're good at that.  Hey, everyone! Squid says he doesn't like Krabby Patties. Ha!\nSquidward: Don't encourage them! They'll never leave.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, it's just so funny.

I don't...\nSquidward: I've never had a Krabby Patty.\nSpongeBob: Those words. Is it possible to use them in a sentence together like that?\nSquidward: I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty! I've never had a Krabby Patty!\nSpongeBob: Never had a Krabby Patty?! Well, you've got to have one right now!  No wonder you're always so miserable! Here, try this.\nSquidward: Get that garbage outta my face!\nSpongeBob: If you try it, you'll love it!\nSquidward: Try one of those radioactive sludge-balls you call food? Next, I suppose you'll want me to go square-dancing with Patrick.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick.  Come on, you're gonna\u2014\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: Open up the tunnel, here comes the train. Choo-choo...\nSquidward: No!\nSpongeBob: Whoop! What's that in your ear?\nSquidward: Quit it.\nSpongeBob: Come on, open wide!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, if I were trapped at the bottom of a well, for three years, with nothing to eat but that Krabby Patty, I'd eat my own legs first...  and not just the extra ones.\nSpongeBob: But it's good for you!\nSquidward: G\u2014good for you?! That thing is a heart attack on a bun!\nSpongeBob: No, Squidward, I meant... good for your soul.\nSquidward: Oh, puh-lease! I have no soul!\nSpongeBob: Okay, just half.\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: A quarter?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: One bite?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: Just smell it.\nSquidward: If I didn't want it out there, what makes you think I'd find it more appealing in here?!\nSpongeBob: Come on, Squidward.\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: One bite.\nSquidward: No...\nSpongeBob: You won't be sorry.\nSquidward: No!\nSpongeBob: It's delicious...\nSquidward: Listen, SpongeBob, how long are you prepared to keep this up?

Horrible! Putrid!  Poorly prepared! Vile! Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich, that has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat!\nSpongeBob: But\u2014\nSquidward: And I curse this Krabby Patty, and all who enjoy them, to an early and well-deserved grave!  Get it?\nSpongeBob: But, it doesn't make any sense. The Krabby Patty is an absolute good. Nobody is immune to its tasty charms.\nSquidward: Nobody but me.\nSpongeBob: Are you sure?\nSquidward: Does this look unsure to you?\nSpongeBob: No.\nSquidward: Good! Now go spread the word!  Come on! Come on! Come on!  Ah... still alive!  Oh, soooo delicious!  Oh...! All the wasted years...!  I gotta have more. I gotta have more!  But wait!  After that performance, he'd never let me live it down! I gotta sneak one. Just one, then... I'm off the stuff for good!\nSpongeBob: I didn't think it was possible, but, I guess some people just don't like Krabby Patties.\nSquidward: Uhh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?\nSquidward: I need a Triple Krabby Supreme on a kelp bun,  with\u2014 with extra sea pickles and, and burn it to a crisp, okay?\nSpongeBob: Coming right up!  Listen, Squidward. I want to apologize for before. I was only trying to make you happy.  But I guess deep down inside, I was trying to make myself happy, but now I've learned there's room for all kinds of people in this crazy old  ...and they all don't have to like the same things.\nSquidward: Don't go...\nSpongeBob: ...And while I strongly disagree with your decision, I accept it.  You know, it's not often I get to make one like this. I want to see the look on their face when they take that first bite.  Triple Krabby Supreme! Triple Krabby Supreme! Did somebody order a Triple Krabby Supreme? Huh, they must've left.\nSquidward: Well, why don't you just, uh, leave it out here, in case they come back.\nSpongeBob: Noooope, a patty this special should be eaten fresh, and... well... I haven't had one of these babies in over twenty minutes, so...  Well, whoever they were, they had great taste!  Ahh, they don't know what they're missing. Well, back to work!\nSquidward: What do I have to do? Eat one out of the garbage?\nFrank: I wish I could eat this, but I'm so darn full. Oh well.\nSquidward: I had to say garbage... but, okay!\nSpongeBob: Oh no, what's this doing here?! This patty should be cremated!

I have got to get my hands on a Krabby Patty! And no one's gonna stop me!  There it is... unguarded! All I have to do is... Wait... It's too easy. There must be some kind of...  security?  This is our burglar alarm? A bucket of water? Ha-ha.  That was too easy.  Hey, this isn't water, this is...gas!\nSquidward: Holy shrimp! I don't know where to start.  All that matters is that it's just you... and me... and nobody...\nSpongeBob: Squidward?  Is that you?\nSquidward: SpongeBob?

What are you doing here?\nSquidward: Uhh, I forgot my...\nSpongeBob: And why is the patty vault open?\nSquidward: Oh, I thought that...\nSpongeBob: And why are you holding a patty behind your back?\nSquidward: I... I... I... no, I didn't do...\nSpongeBob: And why are you acting so nervous? And why are you sweating so much? And why do you look so hungry? And...\nSquidward: No, no, wait... it's not what you think. Th-this is a big misunderstanding. You've got to believe me, I... Listen, I am telling you...  You better listen to me, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: You like Krabby Patties, don't you, Squidward?\nSquidward: Yes! Yes! I admit it, SpongeBob! I love Krabby Patties!\nSpongeBob: I knew it all along, Squidward. No one can resist a Krabby Patty!  Squidward! How many are you eating? Squidward!  Squidward, you can't eat all those patties at one time! Squidward!\nSquidward: What's gonna happen? Am I gonna blow up?\nSpongeBob: No, worse, it'll go right to your thighs...!\nSquidward: My thighs?\nSpongeBob: ...and then you'll blow up!\nJoe: Yeah, I remember my first Krabby Patty.\n","43b\nThe Bully\nSpongeBob: Excuse me, miss?\nNancy: I don't want to have to report you again.\nSpongeBob: I was just wondering...  ...is it the homework pencil on the left side of the paper next to the quiz pencil, or over on the right side all by itself? Or...\nNancy: I think it goes stuck inside your...\nSpongeBob: Wait, I got it! The quiz pencil goes right over here next to the essay pencil  and the essay pencil gets turned sideways toward the notepad,  just in case I have to write an essay.\nMrs. Puff: Good morning class. Sorry I'm late. I got caught in traffic on the way in here when that whole 'I'm-going-to-be-doing-this-for-the-rest-of-my-life' thing reared its ugly head and I...  Anyway, we have a new student starting today, so let's all put on a happy face for Flats the flounder.  Tell the class something about yourself, Flats.\nFlats: Well, I like to kick people's butts.\nMrs. Puff: What a card! Now Flats, it's time to pick your seat. Just go ahead and sit anywhere you'd like.  Okay class, as you remember last week...\nSpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob!\nFlats: Hi, SpongeBob. I'm going to kick your butt.\nSpongeBob: That joke was almost funnier the second time.\nFlats: No. I mean it.\nSpongeBob: That time it almost seemed like...  ...you really did mean it.  Mrs. Puff?\nMrs. Puff: Yes, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Can I be excused for the rest of my life?\nMrs. Puff: Why no, SpongeBob. I'm in the middle of a coffee-fueled sermon right now. You can't afford to miss this information.\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.  Sorry, Mrs. Puff.\nMrs. Puff: Now, can I please have a volunteer to come up to the board? How about you, Flats?  Please draw for us a diagram of a basic four-way intersection, Flats.  Please turn and show the class what you drew, honey.  My, how very creative! We have an artist in the class.\nSpongeBob: I just don't understand. Why would Flats want to kick my butt? I haven't said two words to the guy!  One, two, oh no, that's three! What am I going to do?  What was that? Someone's coming. They're getting closer. I've just got to act natural.\nMartin: Oh that's real nice.\nSpongeBob: Phew, I thought for sure that was gonna be...  Flats! Uh, hello, sir. Kick any good butts lately? Yeah, I remember last week, I was kicking this guy's butt real good. And he leans over and says, 'Hey, you know, life's like a bucket of wood shavings.  Except for when the shavings are in a pail, then it's like a pail of wood shavings!\nFlats: Hey, that story really speaks to me.\nSpongeBob: Really? What's it say?\nFlats: It says now, I'm gonna kick your butt twice as hard.\nSpongeBob: ...and I leave Gary's water bowl to Gary, and my curtains to... oh Neptune, I just can't do this.  Death row, next in line speaking.\nPatrick: Hi, I'd like to place an order for delivery.\nSpongeBob: Patrick? Is that you?\nPatrick: Yeah, hey Mario. Let me get a large double olive, double-\nSpongeBob: Patrick, listen! It's me, SpongeBob! I need your help!\nPatrick: You're working at Pizza Castle now?\nSpongeBob: What? No, listen! I'm in big trouble. There's a new guy at school here and he wants to kick my butt! Listen, you're big and strong, do you think you could come down here and maybe rough him a bit? Just to get him off my back? Please, Patrick, I'm so scared, it feels like I'm gonna throw up.\nPatrick: No, they're not closed. I know, you want olives.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you there?\nPatrick: Oh, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I was just talking to my old community college buddy, Flats.  I bumped into him at the soda store, isn't that funny?  It must have been years since we've seen each other. Well, let me get going. He's got to go back to school soon. He says he's got to kick somebody's butt.  Hello? Is this Pizza Castle?\nMrs. Puff: Come in, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, can I be in a different class?\nMrs. Puff: But why?\nSpongeBob: I can't tell you.\nMrs. Puff: Why ever not?\nSpongeBob: I just can't, Mrs. Puff. My physical being is at stake, let's just leave it at that.\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, you can tell me anything. You've got to believe that.\nSpongeBob: Well, okay. But only if you promise to keep it between us.\nMrs. Puff: Of course.\nSpongeBob: Flats says he's going to kick my butt!\nMrs. Puff: What?! There shall be no butt-kicking in any class of mine! This is an adult program. SpongeBob, just leave it to me.\nSpongeBob: Aw, thanks Mrs. Puff. I knew I could count on you.\nMrs. Puff: Have a nice lunch, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I talked to Flats for you. I used your name. It was all a big misunderstanding.\nSpongeBob: You what?!\nMrs. Puff: He was never going to kick your butt at all! You see SpongeBob, Flats is from a town where kicking someone's butt means that he wants to be your friend.  And maybe play some sports with you on weekends.\nSpongeBob: I've got diarrhea!  Huh? Are you Flats' dad?\nFlats' Dad: Why, yes I am.\nSpongeBob: Okay, see, I didn't know where else to turn! Patrick couldn't help me, and Mrs. Puff only made it worse. I sit next to your son Flats in school, and he is a fine boy and all, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but he wants to kick my butt.\nFlats: Dad, what're you doing?\nFlats' Dad: Uhh, nothing son.\nFlats: What did I tell you about talking to strangers?\nFlats' Dad: Now he's going to kick my butt!\nSpongeBob: Out of my way! Out of my way!  Can't you see he's gonna kick my butt?!\nLonnie: Hi there young people, nice day today.\nHarold: So, you like kicking butts, do ya? Well we'll show you, old man!\nSpongeBob: Okay, okay, I got to skip town, start a new life, live under an assumed name! \"BobPants SpongeSquare\". Yeah, that's good. Grow a beard, and then shave it off, and live happily ever after.\nFlats: Yeah, except you forgot the part where I kick your butt!\nSpongeBob: Hey Flats, you feeling better?\nFlats: What? Where am I?\nPurple Doctorfish: Why, you're in the hospital. This young boy saved your life. He performed CPR for five hours straight.\nSpongeBob: Yeah. They said you'd be okay after the first few minutes, but I just wanted to be sure.\nFlats: Wow, I'm touched. I'll have to remember that when I'm kicking your butt.  Those flowers for me?\nSpongeBob: He's still gonna kick my butt!\nHarold: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man!?\nLonnie: I love the young people!\nSpongeBob: Oh Gary, I'm too young to have my butt kicked! There are so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!  Hang on, I'll transfer your call.  Who is it?  Flats!\nFlats: It's butt-kicking time!\nSpongeBob: Gary, there's something I want you to know, but I'm too scared to remember what it is.\nFlats: Let's do it!\nSpongeBob: Go away, Gary. I don't want you to see this. It'll be ugly.\nFlats: Are you ready?\nSpongeBob: Hold on.  Okay, I'm ready.  I said I'm ready.  Didn't you hear me? I said I'm ready.  That tickles.  Gary, I'm absorbing his blows like I was made of some kind of spongy material! Do you known what that means? I get to go to work tomorrow!  Flats, are you okay?  Do not cheer me, my fellow adult classmates. Flats was the real victim here. A victim of a society that's riding down a violent road to nowhere; a road I call...  ...'violence road'.\nMrs. Puff: Sorry I'm late, class, I...  SpongeBob! I can't believe you beat up a new student!  I'm going to kick your butt!\n","44a\nNasty Patty\nNarrator: Oh, a dark and stormy night. It's nights like these that remind me of the time Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob thought they killed the health inspector.  It was a bright and sunny morning.\nMr. Krabs: Ah...That smells like...  ...the health inspector!  Wash your hands, clean the floors, change your underwear! The health inspector's here!  If he finds one health violation, he'll close us down for good. We've got to do everything in our power to make sure he passes the Krusty Krab.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, there's no reason to worry.  The Krusty Krab is the most perfect place in the universe.\nMr. Krabs: You really haven't got any brains at all, have you, son?  Just go out there and give him what he needs. Pour on the charm. Sweet talk him.\nSpongeBob: What can I get for you...handsome?\nMr. Krabs: We're doomed.\nHealth Inspector: I'm going to need you to bring me one of everything on the menu.\nSpongeBob: Excellent choice, my darling. Coming right up!  He wants one of everything.\nMr. Krabs: Then we'll give him a smorgasbord!  The future of the Krusty Krab is at stake!\nSpongeBob: Try the Krusty Kelp Dog, sir!\nMr. Krabs: The Buttered Barnacles are a touch of heaven.\nSpongeBob: The Powdered Driftwood is exquisite.\nMr. Krabs: Fresh Sludge Pudding?\nSpongeBob: More Diet Red Tide?\nMr. Krabs: Some Fried Flotsam?\nHealth Inspector: Please, gentlemen!  Leave me to finish my work in peace.\nSpongeBob: And did the voluptuous inspector enjoy his meal?\nHealth Inspector: So far, so good. I just need to try a plain Krabby Patty and my inspection will be finished.\nSpongeBob: He says if he gets one more Krabby Patty, he'll pass us for the inspection!\nMr. Krabs: Do you know what this means, dear boy? We're in the clear!\nJohnny Elaine: We interrupt this can-can for a special news bulletin. Be on the lookout for a man, who's been passing himself off as a health inspector in order to obtain free food. That's all for now.\nMr. Krabs: Free food?!\nSpongeBob: Maybe we oughta tell our guy about the phony impostor.\nMr. Krabs: You loony loofah, he is the impostor! We've been duped!\nSpongeBob: Duped!\nMr. Krabs: Bamboozled!\nSpongeBob: We've been smeckledorfed!\nMr. Krabs: That's not even a word, and I agree with ya!  Look at him. I bet he never changes his underpants.\nSpongeBob: I bet he bites whale bubbles.\nMr. Krabs: I bet his mom bought him that hat.  If that impostor wants a Krabby Patty, then by Neptune, we'll give him one.  You're dancin' with the crab man now! Join me, boy, or you're fired!\nSpongeBob: It doesn't seem right...  ...but it feels so good!  Seahorse radish: the gnarliest stuff in the ocean.\nMr. Krabs: Ohh, hold on, I've got a ton of toenail clippings in my office!\nSpongeBob: Oops, I dropped it in the toilet!\nMr. Krabs: Well, fish it out, and I'll dry it with me gym socks!  Why, that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned!\nSpongeBob: I call it the 'Nasty Patty'.\nHealth Inspector: Hey, hurry up with that patty!\nSpongeBob: Here you go, sir, enjoy.\nHealth Inspector: Ah, hello, delicious. Come to papa.\nMr. Krabs: Listen, he ate it!  Oh, look at him choke!  Look at him suffer!  Did you see that, boy? Oh man, the look on his face.\nA Realistic Fish Head: We interrupt your laughter at other people's expense to bring you this news flash. The fake inspector has been captured. Here is his picture.  If a health inspector comes to your restaurant and he's not this guy, he's real.\nSpongeBob: Phew, that's a relief, eh, Mr. Krabs? I'm sure our guy will understand if we just explain the situation. Then we can all have a good laugh about it.\nMr. Krabs: I don't think he'll be laughin', boy.\nSpongeBob: Why, sir?\nMr. Krabs: Because that patty killed him!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?\nMr. Krabs: What's this \"we\" stuff? You fed him the tainted patty. Looks like it's the stony lonesome for you!\nSpongeBob: But you told me to give it to him!\nMr. Krabs: Well, you could've talked me out of it!\nSpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs, I'm guilty. I'll never survive in prison, they'll mop up the floor with me.\nMr. Krabs: Get a hold of yerself, boy! We've got to get rid of this body before anyone sees it. We've got to take it out and bury it.\nSpongeBob: Eww, gross, germs, it's all icky and corpse-y!  Eww...eww...\nMr. Krabs: This should be far enough. Now, get diggin'!\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir.\nMr. Krabs: What's the holdup down there?\nSpongeBob: There's a big rock in the way!\nMr. Krabs: Well, toss it out and get back to diggin'!\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, sir!\nHealth Inspector: Oh... where am I?\nMr. Krabs: Somethin' ain't quite right.\nSpongeBob: What do you mean, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: His head's stickin' out!\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought he might need some air.\nMr. Krabs: They don't need air where he's going.\nSpongeBob: Shouldn't we say a few words on his behalf?\nMr. Krabs: Uhh, he was a credit to health inspectors everywhere, and, uhh...\nSpongeBob: What a brave man, going in the line of duty like that. Why...why...why?!\nMr. Krabs: Listen here, ya little barnacle. No one, and I mean no one can ever know about this. It'll be the end of you, it'll be the end of me. And worst of all, it'll be the end of me!\nOfficer Malley: Stop right where you are! I'm afraid we're going to have to arrest the two of you.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm too young to go to jail!\nMr. Krabs: And what would be the charges?\nOfficer Malley: For not being at the Krusty Krab to whip us up a couple of dee...licious Krabby Patties!\nMr. Krabs: Laugh, boy.\nOfficer Nancy: Put that muddy shovel in the trunk and we'll give you a ride back.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, listen carefully. We're just getting a lift back to the Krusty Krab. I need you to stay calm and don't lose your cool, understand?\nSpongeBob: Can I lose my cool now?\nMr. Krabs: Why?  Put it in the trunk, boy! I'll keep them cops busy.\nOfficer Malley: What's the holdup back there?\nSpongeBob: Oh, Neptune! Get away!  Ooh...ahh-ahh...  A-hem... Okay! All set back here. Nothing unusual about a muddy shovel in the trunk.\nMr. Krabs: All set.\nSpongeBob: Ahh...\nOfficer Nancy: You okay there, little fella?\nMr. Krabs: Ooh, he gets carsick real easy.\nOfficer Malley: Well, buckle up and we'll drive real smooth-like.\nMr. Krabs: Now listen, SpongeBob, when we get to the Krusty Krab I want you to take that  shovel and bring it around to the back entrance and stuff...er... I mean, stow it in the freezer. Un-der-stand?\nSpongeBob: I understand, Mr. Krabs, but what do you want me to do with the bo...\nMr. Krabs: ...ttles of soda! Bottles of soda, Same thing, put 'em in the freezer.\nSpongeBob: Oh, man, this is so gross!  The back door is locked! What am I gonna do?!\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy there, SpongeBob. Heh. I thought you were out back taking care of that  shovel.\nSpongeBob: Well, the back door was locked, so I came around here...eh.  So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put my hat in the freezer now.\nMr. Krabs: Okey-dokey, SpongeBob.\nOfficer Malley: Is that boy okay?\nOfficer Nancy: He's actin' a little funny.\nMr. Krabs: Funny? Oh. Yeah.  He's a real cut-up, that one. He knows how to keep the crew in stitches. Good one, boy! Always on, that one. There's no off on his funny switch.  Oh, ah, oh stop it. Oh, you're, you're killin' me.  Oh! Look, I almost forgot! It's open cash register night! First two customers get all the money in the cash register!\nOfficer Malley: 86 those patties, Krabs. We just got a call about two ghouls burying a stiff over by Shallow Grave Road.\nOfficer Nancy: I want a soda.\nMr. Krabs: Here's your soda. Always a pleasure to serve the folks in blue. Well, goodbye now.\nOfficer Nancy: Hey, there's no ice.\nMr. Krabs: Ice? Ice? You want ice? Is that what you want, you want ice? Is that what you want?\nSpongeBob: The dark deed you requested is done, sir.\nOfficer Nancy: I'll get it myself. Ice is in the freezer, ri...?\nMr. Krabs: There is no ice! There's never been any ice. Ice is just a myth!\nOfficer Nancy: Step aside. You people act like you've committed a murder!\nMr. Krabs: Okay! I confess!  SpongeBob killed him!\nSpongeBob: What? You can't pin this whole rap on me!\nMr. Krabs: He was insane, out of control. He would've killed me too if you two hadn't come along.\nSpongeBob: It was all Mr. Krabs' idea.\nMr. Krabs: Put him down now, he's a mad dog!\nSpongeBob: He wears curlers to bed!\nMr. Krabs: Wait! It's not what you think!\nOfficer Nancy: What are you two talking about?\nMr. Krabs: We killed the health inspector, buried him, and then stuffed his body in the freezer.\nOfficer Nancy: You mean in here?\nMr. Krabs: It's empty?\nOfficer Nancy: Is this some kind of a joke?\nMr. Krabs: Yeah...a joke!\nOfficer Nancy: Say, maybe he turned into a zombie and walked out.\nSpongeBob: It's the zombie!\nHealth Inspector: You guys should...\nOfficer Malley: Take that, you zombie!\nOfficer Nancy: I'll take it from here.  Die, zombie!\nOfficer Malley: Good police work, officer Nancy. Hey, this guy's not a zombie. He's just an ordinary health inspector.\nHealth Inspector: Yes. And at the risk of being hit again, I'd like to present you with this.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, look. We passed the inspection!\nEveryone: Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: Come on, everybody. Krabby Patties at half price! Well, not really.\nHealth Inspector: Oh, boy, I'd like a Krabby Patty.\nNarrator: Well, that's the story. Yes, they are all idiots, aren't they?\n","44b\nIdiot Box\nSpongeBob: See anything yet, Patrick?\nPatrick: I need my glasses.  Hmmm...  ...it's the mail truck!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Our package!\nSquidward: I didn't realize it was Happy Hopping Moron Day.\nMailman: SpongeBob SquarePants?\nSpongeBob: That's me!\nSquidward: That's a big box!\nSpongeBob: Thank you!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, when do we stop hopping?\nSpongeBob: Thirty more seconds, Patrick.\nSquidward: They probably ordered a lifetime supply of bubble soap.  Huh? A brand-new television?\nSpongeBob: Easy... easy...\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!\nSquidward: Just when I thought they couldn't get any stupider.  Let me get this straight, you two ordered a giant screen television just so you could play in the box?\nSpongeBob: Pretty smart, huh?\nPatrick: I thought it wouldn't work.\nSquidward: Uh-huh, that's quite a plan there. Oh, but wait, there was something else I wanted to ask you two. Now what was it? Oh, yeah, yeah.  Don't you two have any brains?!\nSpongeBob: Squidward, we don't need a television. Not as long as we have our...  ...imagination!\nSquidward: Wow, I never thought of it that way. That's really something. Can I have your TV?\nSpongeBob: With...  ...imagination, I can be anything I want! A pirate!  Arrrrr! A football player!  Hup!\nPatrick: A starfish!\nSquidward: Patrick, you're already a starfish.\nPatrick: See, Squidward? It works! You try!\nSquidward: Okay, let's see. I'm imaging myself watching TV...  ...and there it is!

Patrick! Patrick, you're going too high!\nSquidward: I hope they put some air holes in that box.\nSpongeBob: Take it easy, Patrick, you've got to acclimate!\nPatrick: I'll take it easy when I'm dead! I'm shaking hands with Neptune! Whoo! Excelsior!\nSquidward: Now where's that remote?\nPatrick: I am the lizard king! Whoo!\nSpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick? Patrick! I think we should keep our voices down! We might start an avalanche!\nPatrick: What?\nSpongeBob: I said, I think we should keep our voices down in case of avalanches!\nPatrick: What should we keep down?\nSquidward: Morons.\nSpongeBob: Our voices!\nSquidward: Will you two shut up?!  Sponge... Bob?\nPatrick: Hold me.\nSpongeBob: Hang in there buddy, the chopper's on the way!\nPatrick: SpongeBob! My legs are frozen solid! You're going to have to cut them off with a saw!\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, I can't do that!\nPatrick: Why not?\nSpongeBob: Because I already cut off my own arms!\nPatrick: Nooooo!\nSquidward: What the? How were you two making that noise?\nSpongeBob: What noise, Squidward?\nPatrick: I could only hear the sound of our laughter.\nSquidward: Yes! But those sound effects: the avalanche, the, the, the...\nPatrick: Don't forget the second avalanche.\nSquidward: Forget it.

How are you two making those noises?\nPatrick: That's easy. All you need is a box.\nSpongeBob: And...  ...imagination.\nSquidward: Are you trying to say that I have no imagination? I have more imagination...  ...in one tentacle than you two have in your whole bodies.\nPatrick: That's good. Now all you need is a box.\nSquidward: I'll show them!  There's got to be one in here!  Ah! This hat box should do nicely.  Why haven't I worn this yet?\nPoliceman Inside SpongeBob and Patrick's box: Attention! We have you surrounded! Come out with your hands up!\nSquidward: What do they want with me? What did I do?  Obviously, I've violated some new box kicking law!  Look officers, everything's okay. I won't do it again!\nCriminal Inside Box: You'll never take me alive, coppers!\nMan Inside Box: No, Johnny! Don't do it!\nPatrick: Whoopee! Another box!\nSquidward: I got to try to relax.

Don't mind me, I'm just here to observe.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, don't you see? Waiting and watching? That's not what the box is all about! It's about...  ...imagination.\nSquidward: All right, fine!  Take me to Robot Pirate Island! I wanna arm-wrestle with cowboys on the moon! Just do it so I can get back and watch TV!\nSpongeBob: Okay, Squidward! Robot Pirate Island it is!\nPatrick: Beep-beep-beep.\nSpongeBob: Arr.\nPatrick: Beep-boop-bee-boop.\nSpongeBob: Ahoy matey!\nPatrick: Beep-beep.\nSpongeBob: For that you'll walk the plank!\nSquidward: Why won't this thing turn on?!  All right, fine. If you don't want to show me,  I don't care! I've got better things to do than pace the floor wondering how you two work this thing.  How do those two work that thing? There's got to be a secret button or a switch or something! I mean, listen to that!  Now, that sounds like Robot Pirate Island! Think, Squidward, think! I got it: when those two go to bed, I'll sneak in there and find that button! I'll wait all night if I have to!\nI need sleep to refuel my imagination tanks!\nSpongeBob: I still can't believe those pirates beat all those robots.\nPatrick: Yeah, see you in the morning.\nSpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.\nSquidward: Hello, what's this?  \"This plaque is to commemorate the brave pirates who gave their lives to keep this box safe from the Robot Menace. Lest we forget... Ohh!  I've got to find that button quick!  It's got to be around here somewhere. I don't see anything! It's just an empty box! Maybe it really was their imagination. Oh... get it together, Squidward! What are you saying? I mean, do I really believe that if I sit here and pretend to drive a race car that I'm suddenly going to start hearing noises?  What the...?  It actually works! I can't believe it! Ha-ha! Oh boy! This beats TV by a long shot!  Whooo-hoo-hoo! This is the most fun I've ever had!\nSpongeBob: Listen to that, Gary.

Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.\nSpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy? Must... get... autograph!\nMermaid Man: If you wanna grow up strong like me,...  you gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes our waiter.\nSpongeBob: Autograph!\nBarnacle Boy: Holy sea cow, it's that Sponge-kid!\nMermaid Man: Quick, lad,  to the invisible boat mobile!  Away!\nBarnacle Boy: Where'd we park?\nMermaid Man: Uhh...\nSpongeBob: Can I have your autograph, can I have your autograph, can I... they're gone.  Mermaid Man's belt!\nMermaid Man: Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm!  There she is!\nBarnacle Boy: Eee-ow!  I told you we shoulda got the automatic!\nSpongeBob: Hey, guys! Wait up!  I've got something for you...\nBarnacle Boy: Floor it!\nSpongeBob: You forgot your belt! You forgot\u2014  Mermaid Man's secret utility belt. The emblem of submersible justice! For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations... and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it.  Or not.  I could just hang onto it till after work... all alone with Mermaid Man's belt. I wonder what this button does.  Whoa.  The small ray.\nSquidward: Here's your shake, sir.  Grr.\nSpongeBob: There you go. Come again, sir.\nSquidward: SpongeBob. What's going on in here? Huh?  Why's everything all tiny?\nSpongeBob: I don't know.\nSquidward: What do you got there?\nSpongeBob: Nothing.\nSquidward: No, really?\nSpongeBob: Nothing.\nSquidward: You've got something, alright. Let's see it.\nSpongeBob: No, no!\nSquidward: Is that Mermaid Man's belt?\nSpongeBob: Yes.\nSquidward: Wow. I can't believe he'd lend it to you.\nSpongeBob: Me, uh... either.\nSquidward: He didn't lend it to you, did he?\nSpongeBob: Please don't tell!\nSquidward: You stole it!\nSpongeBob: Please don't tell!\nSquidward: Oh, I'm telling.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure! Please don't tell!\nSquidward: Uh-oh!  There's the phone.\nSpongeBob: Don't!\nSquidward: I'm walking towards the phone!\nSpongeBob: No!\nSquidward: I'm getting closer to the phone.\nSpongeBob: Do-o-o-n't!\nSquidward: And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for.\nSpongeBob: I'm begging you!\nSquidward: Hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid...  What the? What?  Ow!\nMermaid Man: Hello? Hello?\nSquidward: What did you do to me?!\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, if you don't return me to normal size right now, you are gonna be in really big trouble!\nSpongeBob: Uh... uh, okay, uh...\nSquidward: I said now!\nSpongeBob: Uh...  Uh...\nSquidward: Do you hear me?!  Holy fish paste! Get it off me! Get it off me!  Don't you know how to work that thing?!\nSpongeBob: Uhh, I can do it!\nSquidward: Stop! I've got an idea. Let's call Mermaid Man and--\nSpongeBob: No! I can't let you do that! But there must be someone else who can help! Someone smart and wise, with years of life experience.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!\nPatrick: Ehh? Huh? Oh. Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I was at work, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt, and look.\nPatrick: A Squidward action figure!  Let me play with him!\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick!\nPatrick: Fighter pilot!  Dive bomb!\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\nPatrick: And then comes a giant fist!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, no! That's not an action figure! That's the real Squidward! I shrunk him by accident.\nPatrick: Oh...  And then comes a giant --\nSpongeBob: Wait, you don't understand! This is serious! I don't know how to unshrink him! He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.\nPatrick: Oh, don't worry about it. He'll find love one day.\nSpongeBob: You think so?\nPatrick: Well, sure. But it'll be with someone his own size.  Like this pickle! See? They like each other!\nSquidward: N-n-n-n-no.\nSpongeBob: Oh, if only I knew how to work this thing!\nPatrick: Let me take a look at it. Hmmm. You know what the problem is?\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: You got it set to  'M' for Mini when it should be set to  'W' for Wumbo.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think Wumbo is a real word.\nPatrick: Come on! You know... I wumbo, You wumbo, He, she, me... wumbo! Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, Wumborama... Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!\nSquidward: I wonder if a fall from this height could be enough to kill me.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I'm sorry I doubted you.\nPatrick: Well, all right, then. Let her rip!  It worked!\nSpongeBob: Oh no!\nPatrick: Look, SpongeBob's giant!  Can I be giant next?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too!\nPatrick: You're kidding!  Good thing I still got this pickle!\nSquidward: Hey! Now will you take us to Mermaid Man?!\nSpongeBob: No! He can never find out! But I'll think of something. I promise.  Until then, you'll be safe in this jar.\nPatrick: You know what's funny? My pickle started out in a jar, and now it's in one again! Heh. It's like a pun or something. Heheh.\nSpongeBob: It's only two people no big deal, nobody else saw it.\nSandy: Howdy, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Sandy!\nSandy: What did you... For cryin' out... What did y'all do to me?\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy! Mermaid Man came in and...\nLarry: Hey, SpongeBob!\nNat: Hey, SpongeBob, I --\nNancy Suzy Fish: Hi, SpongeBob.\nMrs. Puff: Hello, SpongeBob.\nScooter: Sponge-dude!\nFish #1: Hey, SpongeBob!\nFish #2: SpongeBob, hi!\nFish #3: Hey, SpongeBob!\nFish #4: What's up, Sponge?\nSpongeBob: Whoo! I'm gonna have to get a bigger jar.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, will you just face facts? You've shrunken everybody in Bikini Bottom! You've got to go to Mermaid Man!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, he'll be so disappointed.\nSandy: Well, you can't leave us small forever!\nSpongeBob: You don't understand!\nMrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob. You need to admit your mistakes.\nSpongeBob: Mom?\nMermaid Man: Your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand.\nBarnacle Boy: You're Mermaid Man, you old coot!\nMermaid Man: Oh, yeah.\nSpongeBob: Mermaid Man? I'm so sorry, it's just that I'm such a big fan, and your belt, and...\nMermaid Man: Awww, don't worry, son. I understand!  Why, I remember back when I first used the belt, the year was nineteen aught eleventeen twelve, why I believe the president.\nEveryone: Just tell him how to unshrink us!\nMermaid Man: Oh, yes. The unshrink ray. Let's see, uh, uh\u2014 Did you set it to Wumbo?\nEveryone: What?!  Get SpongeBob!\nSquidward: Now I have to drive five miles to go to the bathroom... in my own home!\nSandy: And I need an elevator to climb one stair! Hi-ya!\nMermaid Man: We've been shrinking for years!\nBarnacle Boy: But this is ridiculous!\nEveryone: Everything's too big!\nSpongeBob: I've got it!  Ta-da!  Since I couldn't make you big, I made the city small!  And now, only one more thing to shrink. Cheese!\nSquidward: I guess this is okay.\nLarry: Yeah, what's the difference?\nNancy: Good idea, SpongeBob.\nPlankton: Well, it's great to be back!  Huh?\n","45b\nDoing Time\nSpongeBob: I'm driving, Mrs. Puff! This is the one! This is the one! Come, on SpongeBob! Think! Think! Uhh...  Turn that way! Turn that way! D'oh! Turn that way! Right! Left! Oh no! No!  Come on, don't ever do that! Come on!  No! I'm ready! I can do this, Mrs. Puff! I can do it! I can do it!\nMrs. Puff: The driving test is over, SpongeBob. Stop the boat!\nSpongeBob: Wait, I can do this, Mrs. Puff, I can do this!\nMrs. Puff: The road, SpongeBob, get back on the road!\nSpongeBob: Gotta pass the test! Gotta pass!\nVendor: Hey! What've you got against the melons?!\nMrs. Puff: Look out!\nSpongeBob: This must be the night driving part of the test.\nOfficer Nancy: We're gonna straighten you out!\nOfficer Malley: This'll fix ya!  Now let's get that one.\nOfficer Nancy: Barnacles, did you see that?!\nOfficer Malley: Yeah! That guy had no front license plate! Let's get him!\nSpongeBob: Hey, look at all those police! I wonder if the president's in town.\nMrs. Puff: Look out!\nMayor: It is with great pride that I officially open this unfinished bridge!\nMrs. Puff: Where did I go wrong?!  With the opening of my new boating school, I pledge that as long as a student is willing to learn, I shall never give up.\nSpongeBob: Hi, I'm SpongeBob SquarePants.\nFish: Hurry up with that truckload of fruit punch! The seniors are getting cranky!\nMrs. Puff: Alive! I'm alive! Oh, thank Neptune, I'm still...\nFeminine Tom: Alright, seniors, let's open these windows so the world can see your nice white clothes.\nElderly Fish: Oh, it's finally finished! A memoir of my life, written in red ink.  Aww, barnacles!\nMrs. Puff: Ow. SpongeBob, are you okay?\nSpongeBob: That depends, did I pass?\nOfficer Nancy: Freeze, you're under arrest!\nMrs. Puff: Hold it, you can't arrest him! He's just a student driver!\nOfficer Nancy: We're not talking about him.\nMrs. Puff: But I don't belong here! It's all a big mistake!\nPrisoner 1: Yeah, I don't belong here, either!\nPrisoner 2: Me too! I'm innocent!\nPrisoner 3: I belong here!\nMrs. Puff: Okay, you can do this, Puff. You can get through this without losing your sanity. Oh, that's a road we don't want to go down again. Positives. Think of the positives. Let's see... I've got no more papers to grade. Yeah!  In fact, no more work. No more boating school classes. No more driving, no more SpongeBob...  No more phone solicitors, no more SpongeBob! No more company potlucks, no more SpongeBob!  No more road rage, no more SpongeBob! No more insurance payments, no more SpongeBob! No more SpongeBob!  No more SpongeBob!  No more SpongeBob!  I think I'm going to like this place.\nSpongeBob: Class just isn't the same without Mrs. Puff. Just the thought of her alone and afraid in jail makes me think about her being alone and afraid in jail. I don't know how she's going to survive.\nMrs. Puff: \u266aSmelling the pretty roses, whoo hoo hoo.\u266a  \u266aHaaapiness is just two kinds of ice creeeeam!\u266a\nSpongeBob: Oh, that poor woman. And it's all my fault. Maybe if I go talk to Patrick, he can ease my guilt.\nPatrick: Well, it sounds like it's all your fault.\nSpongeBob: Oh, you're right! Mrs. Puff's in jail and it's all because of me! I'm such a barnacle head!  Poor Mrs. Puff. I know, I gotta get her out! But to get her out of jail, first we gotta get in jail.\nPatrick: How are we gonna do that?\nSpongeBob: Alright, put the money in the bag!  Put it in!\nBank Teller: Umm, you're facing the wrong way, sir.\nSpongeBob: Alright, give me the money!\nBank Teller: Will that be from your savings or your checking account, sir?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, savings.\nBank Teller: May I please see some identification?\nSpongeBob: Sure.  Here ya go.\nBank Teller: Thank you.  Sir, we are showing a balance of zero dollars and zero cents for both of your accounts.\nSpongeBob: Oh.\nBank Teller: Next!\nSpongeBob: Well, that went better than expected.\nPatrick: Yeah! I didn't think we'd get Mrs. Puff out of jail this fast!\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get into jail this time.\nFish: Hey, there's a couple.\nGuard: Put your back in it, girls!\nSpongeBob: Look, Patrick, there she is!  Mrs. Puff, wait, it's us, SpongeBob and Patrick!\nMrs. Puff: That's funny. For a second, I thought that yellow rock talked to me. And its voice sounded a lot like...\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob. It's me, SpongeBob.  We're gonna bust you out of here. C'mon, Mrs. Puff!\nMrs. Puff: It's you. What are you doing here? Why did you follow me in here? Why?!\nGuard #1: Alright, Mrs. Puff, it seems like this heat's gone to your head. If you're gonna talk to rocks, I guess it's time for you to go on kitchen duty.\nMrs. Puff: Yes, it must be the heat. Yes.\nSpongeBob: Darn it! Okay, Patrick, let's get out of here.  No, wait!  There goes our deposit on these costumes.\nMrs. Puff: There you are.\nWoman: Hey there, Puff Mama. What's today's grub?\nMrs. Puff: Hi, Donna. It's chili, same as always. Let me get you some.\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob!\nMrs. Puff: When are these horrific hallucinations going to end?\nSpongeBob: No, it's really me!  I brought Patrick along too.\nPatrick: Hi.\nMrs. Puff: Why?\nSpongeBob: 'Cause we're gonna set you free!\nMrs. Puff: No, I mean, why'd you bring him?\nSpongeBob: He likes chili. Now quick, get in before someone sees.\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I am not going with you.\nSpongeBob: That's a good one, Mrs. Puff. Now hop in. Come on!\nPatrick: SpongeBob, I think she means it.\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's crazy, Patrick.\nMrs. Puff: He's right, SpongeBob. I'm staying.\nSpongeBob: But why?\nMrs. Puff: I like it here. These are my people!  And besides, if I'm in here, that means I won't have to deal with yooou...  ...uranium! In the water supply.  See? Crystal clear!  Aahhhh!\nSpongeBob: Excuse us for just one second, Mrs. Puff.  Patrick, she has lost it! She's completely institutionalized. She's forgotten what it's like to live on the outside. To not be in prison.\nFrankie's wife: Coming to bed, honey?\nFrankie Billy: Yes, dear.\nSpongeBob: We've got to remind her that there is a life other than this. Mrs. Puff, if you come with us, I'll stay after school and decorate the whole classroom.\nMrs. Puff: For the last time, no!  I'm not going with you! That's final!  Oh.\nGuard #1: Talking to inanimate objects again, huh, Puff? Hmph. Get back to your cell. No more kitchen time for you.\nSpongeBob: Quick, Mrs. Puff, hop on!\nMrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come quick.  There's a crazed ex-student of mine and his overweight friend here to break me out!\nGuard #1: That's just raw material used to make coat hangers. You need some rest.\nSpongeBob: Psst!  Hop in, Mrs. Puff.\nMrs. Puff: Guards! Guards, come look!\nGuard #1: Whoa. They don't pay me enough to do this job.\nSpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, up here.\nMrs. Puff: Guards, guards! They're back!\nGuard #1: What's all the hubbub, Puff?\nMrs. Puff: They're back!\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Mrs. Puff, it's us!\nGuard #1: What the barnacle is going on?\nMrs. Puff: Get away from me! Get away!\nGuard #1: What are you talking about, Puff?\nMrs. Puff: You can't fool me! You're SpongeBob and that guy who likes the chili.\nGuard #1: Let's face it, Puff, you've gone off the deep end.  Get in there, you! You need a nice long stay in solitary confinement!\nMrs. Puff: Oh well. Let's look at the positives again. I'm finally away from those two. Yes. All alone in my nice, soft room.\nSpongeBob: Made of sponge!  I can pass the test, Mrs. Puff! I can pass the test!\nOfficer Malley: Freeze! Your joyride's over, punk.\nMrs. Puff: No! What?\nSpongeBob: No! What are you doing? Help! Help!  No, no, please! I have a snail to feed! I can't go to jail now! This is not a good time! No, please, please! I'm not a criminal!\nMrs. Puff: I can't believe it. It was all a dream. I'm not going to jail!\nOfficer Malley: Why would you go to jail? You already did your time.\nMrs. Puff: Oh, it's just my imagination again.\nDonna: So what's for dinner tonight, Puff Mama? Chili?\nMrs. Puff: Huh? What? Huh? Ah, forget it.\n","46a\nSnowball Effect\nNarrator: Ah, observe the majesty of the mighty iceberg.  This frozen giant, normally found floating in polar regions, can sometimes  stray into warmer waters, causing dramatic changes in climate  for tropical, undersea life.\nJohnny Elaine: Yes, it seems Old Man Winter paid us a visit late last night, and he brought with him not a pillow or a sheet,  but a blanket... a blanket of snow!  Yes, from Jellyfish Fields...  to residential abodes...  to bustling downtown...  it's nothing but the white stuff.\nSpongeBob: Whoopee!\nJohnny Elaine: And local residents are taking notice!\nFred: Hey!\nPlankton: What's this? Drops of rain frozen into ice crystals? I shall harness their energy and rule the world!  Ahh... oh, stop! I wish to rule you!\nPatrick: Snow angel!  Oh...  Hey!  Thanks a lot, SpongeBob! While you were just standing there whistling, someone threw a snowball at me!\nSpongeBob: Oh, really, Patrick?  Did the snowball look like this?\nPatrick: Yeah.  This is serious, SpongeBob. Someone's after me. I think I better leave town.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I threw it. We're having a snowball fight. Don't you get it?\nPatrick: Snowball fight? I want to play! I want to play!\nSpongeBob: Well, first, you have to make a snowball.\nPatrick: Oh, yeah. A snowball.  Oh, this is gonna be great!  Huh?  Wha...?  Aw...! SpongeBob, could you help me make a snowball?\nSpongeBob: Sure, pal.\nPatrick: Thanks, buddy.\nSpongeBob: Patrick! How could you?\nPatrick: It's a snowball fight, remember?\nSpongeBob: Oh yeah.\nSquidward: Ah, yes. Warm fire, cozy slippers, and a piping hot cup of tea with a lemon wedge.  Why do I even bother?  Would you two please keep it down?!\nSpongeBob: Squidward! You're just in time to enlist in my army! Join me, and together we'll defeat the Pink Menace!\nPatrick: That's me!\nSpongeBob: I can start you off as a buck private, but with hard work, perhaps you can rise through the ranks and become a regular private!\nSquidward: Thanks, but no, thanks, Major Stupidity. You and General Nonsense over there will have to fight without me.  Got 'em Both.  Grrrrrrrr!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you fool! This was over before it started! I will now consider your unconditional surren-...  ...-der.  So that's how he wants it to go down.\nPatrick: Huh?  Ha! You missed me!\nSpongeBob: Score one for the boys back home!\nSquidward: Yes? Oh, Patrick.  What an unpleasant surprise. Oh, boy, nothing like a game of charades.\nPatrick: I was trying to tell you that I was choking on snow, but the snow melted and turned into water, and I drank all the water, now I'm better.\nSquidward: Fascinating.  Now, where was I?  What?\nPatrick: Can I use your bathroom?\nSquidward: Patrick, go use your own bathroom.\nPatrick: I don't think I can make it! Please?\nSquidward: No.\nPatrick: Please?\nSquidward: No.\nPatrick: Please?\nSquidward: No.\nPatrick: Please!\nSquidward: Okay, make it quick.\nPatrick: That's okay.\nSpongeBob: Aha! Aiding the enemy! I've caught you red-handed, Squidward!\nSquidward: Look, SpongeBob, I was just...  SpongeBob! Oh...\nPatrick: Yay! Squidward's on my side!\nSquidward: I most certainly am not!\nSpongeBob: Then that means he's on my side!\nSquidward: No, SpongeBob, I'm not on your side either. I'm on nobody's side. Snowball fights are for immature children and I will not stoop to your level.  If you two want to knock each other's brains out with snowballs, kindly leave me out of it.\nPatrick: Come on, SpongeBob, let's go knock each other's brains out!\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!\nSquidward: Hmm...\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's out.\nSquidward: Now there's something I'd actually like to see!  Nothing wrong with getting a front-row seat, I suppose.  Ahh. What's this?  Wha... I... no!  What are you doing? You're supposed to be  knocking each other's brains out!\nSpongeBob: We signed a peace treaty, Squidward.  You were right, fighting is for children.\nSquidward: No, no, no, I misled you, it's for adults too! Give me that peace treaty!  There! Let the war continue!\nSpongeBob: Squidward, that wasn't the peace treaty. That was a copy of the peace treaty.\nSquidward: Look, you two are giving up too easily. Now, Patrick, pretend I'm SpongeBob.\nPatrick: And who am I?\nSquidward: You're Patrick.\nSpongeBob: Can I be Mr. Krabs?\nSquidward: No! Wait, why?\nSpongeBob: He's a good leader.\nSquidward: Would you butt out?!\nPatrick: Hey, you can't talk to Mr. Krabs like that, Squidward!\nSquidward: I'm SpongeBob! You're Patrick!  Now, what are you going to do?  Patrick, why didn't you hit SpongeBob?\nPatrick: You said you were SpongeBob, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Argh! It's true, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!\nSquidward: Oh, boy. All right, I can see where this is going. Let's just say for all intents and purposes that I, Squidward, am now part in this war. Now...\nSpongeBob: If you're in this war, then where's your fort?\nSquidward: I don't have one, okay? Now...\nPatrick: You got to have a fort, Squidward.\nSpongeBob: Forts win wars, Squidward.\nSquidward: Okay, fine! You want a fort?  There. There's your fort! Now...\nPatrick: That fort's too small, Squidward.\nSquidward: It's okay, Patrick. It's just a demonstration. Now...\nSpongeBob: He's right, Squidward. That thing would never protect you. It's downright puny.\nSquidward: Trust me, it's fine.\nSpongeBob: See, it is too small.\nSquidward: Not if I crouch down. I mean, you didn't even give me a chance to crouch down.  See? Down here, I am perfectly...\nSpongeBob: Exposed.\nSquidward: Would you two please...  ...stop throwing...  ...snowballs?!\nSpongeBob: Squidward returned fire!\nPatrick: Then it's war!\nSquidward: No-no... no, wait, wait, wait!  I was just giving a demonstration!  All right, that's it! You guys asked for it!  I got him! Ha! I got him!  In your face, SpongeBob!  This was actually kind of... exciting! Why... I've never felt so alive!\nPatrick: He got you good, SpongeBob!  Take cover!\nSquidward: Take that... I got you... Yeah... oh, I got you... oh, take that... Whoa, I got you that time... Oh yeah...  Incoming!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\nPatrick: I think Squidward's taking this really seriously.  That last one had his clarinet in it.\nSpongeBob: Hmm... looks like it's time for Plan B.\nSquidward: What's going on? The snowballs have stopped falling. I better take advantage of this momentary cease-fire.  What? My left flank is exposed? That bloated starfish is gonna run right through me!  I'll just fix that right now.  Wait, that makes my north wall a weak spot! Here we go! Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh! But if they attack from the rear, I'm a goner!  There... Ha-ha!  But what about the possibility of an aerial attack!  I guess that ought to do it!  Fort Squidward is now all but impenetrable!  Now, where are those fools?  Ha! The first shot has been fired!  Take this, Patrick!  Taste my frozen fury!  Victory is mine!  Whee! Ha-ha! Well, I got you now!\nSpongeBob: Did you hear something, Patrick?\nPatrick: Nope.\nMan on TV: Get out the snowshoes and the shovels.\n","46b\nOne Krabs Trash\nFrench Narrator: Ah, a yard sale. You know the old saying: \"One man's trash is another man's treasure.\"\nMr. Krabs: Disposable? Phooey.\nNarrator: For Mr. Krabs, all trash is treasure.\nMr. Krabs: Open for business.  See anything you like?\nFish #1: Yeah, I'll give you a buck-50 for this umbrella.\nMr. Krabs: A buck-50 for that? But it's an antique! It belonged to a queen. Ten bucks.\nFish #1: Ten bucks?  It's full of holes.\nMr. Krabs: It was the queen of Switzerland.\nFish #1: A queen you say? That's-- Wait a second... they don't have a queen!\nMr. Krabs: Okay, Mr. Bargain Hunter, five bucks.\nFish #1: Deal!\nMr. Krabs: Ah, the sweet smell of an all-day sucker.\nSpongeBob: They taste even better.  Hi, Mr. Krabs.\nPatrick: Whatcha you doing?\nMr. Krabs: I'm having an antique sale. Have a look around.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, look at this thing. Pretty cool, huh?\nPatrick: That looks like the toilet plunger I threw out yesterday.\nMr. Krabs: That ain't no toilet plunger! This here's an antique! It's, um... uh...  ...a 17th-century soup ladle, see?\nPatrick: Man, was I using mine wrong. How much?\nMr. Krabs: Five bucks.\nPatrick: I only got seven.\nMr. Krabs: Deal.\nPatrick: Patrick Star, you are one smart shopper.\nSpongeBob: Wow! Look at this neat-o soda drinking hat. Oh! It must've belonged to someone who was number 1. There's only been a handful of number ones in the history of forever.\nMr. Krabs: That's right, SpongeBob, and you're one of 'em.\nSpongeBob: Really?\nMr. Krabs: This hat says, \"Hey, I'm number 1, and I let gravity do my drinking.\" This hat was made for you, boy.  You were born to wear this hat.\nSpongeBob: Ee-hee, ooh...!\nMr. Krabs: A perfect fit, eh, son?\nSpongeBob: Oh, thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you for bringing us together!  How can I ever repay you?\nMr. Krabs: With 10 dollars.\nSpongeBob: All I have is 5.\nMr. Krabs: Well, I guess it's no deal.\nSpongeBob: I'll be right back.  Mr. Krabs, I found 68 cents. But maybe you can take the other $4.32 out of my paycheck! What do you say?\nMr. Krabs: Well-- I don't know... uh, okay! But only because you look so dashing in that hat.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Don't mention it, boys.  What a couple of rubes.\nFish #2: Excuse me, sir, but are you the purveyor of this curio stand?\nMr. Krabs: Yes, I am.\nFish #2: I understand you're selling this rare novelty drink hat.\nMr. Krabs: Fresh out.\nFish #2: Let me explain.  I'm prepared to give you $500 for that drink hat.\nMr. Krabs: Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-...\nFish #3: Not so fast.  I'll give you $1000 for such a hat.\nNat: I'll give you $100,000, in cash, for said hat.\nFred: Sir? I'll give you one million dollars for that hat!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  There he is with me million dollar hat. I gotta get it back before he finds out how much it's worth.\nSpongeBob: Ah! My bubble production has increased two-fold, thanks to you, Hatty.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. K. How's the antique biz treating you?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, never mind that. Listen, I didn't want to say this in front of Patrick, but that hat makes you look like a girl.\nSpongeBob: Am I a pretty girl?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, well, um... you're... you're beautiful.  Uh... heh-heh.  All right, now give me the hat back.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, you said it yourself... I was born to wear this hat. I don't want to give it back. I can't get rid of this hat now. Not after all that we've been through.  Thanks, Mr. Krabs, I'll call you Hatty. And that's when you showed up.\nMr. Krabs: Aw, forget it! And you're not beautiful, either.\nSpongeBob: I'm not?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Just the man I wanted to see. Still playing with that dumb old hat, eh?\nSpongeBob: Yep.\nMr. Krabs: Not sick of that boring old hat, yet?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nMr. Krabs: Not even a little tired of that old piece of junk?\nSpongeBob: Uh-uh.\nMr. Krabs: Not even a teensy-tiny bit?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nMr. Krabs: Well, then I guess you don't want to see what's in my bag.\nSpongeBob: What is it?\nMr. Krabs: Novelty hats.  How about this air-condition one?\nSpongeBob: Seems a little dangerous.\nMr. Krabs: The juicer.\nSpongeBob: Ooh...\nMr. Krabs: Foxy Grandpa?  So, what do you say? Your silly hat for all these hats?\nSpongeBob: No deal, Mr. Krabs. I'm sticking with Hatty. Thanks for the offer, though.\nMr. Krabs: I thought the Foxy Grandpa would get him for sure. I didn't want to have to do this, but he leaves me no other option.  I'm gonna have to scare it off of him.  Heh-heh-heh! This'll scare him.\nSpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! A floating shopping list!\nMr. Krabs: I'm not a shopping list...  I'm a ghost!\nMr. Krabs: Now, listen, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: How do you know my name?! Who are you?!\nMr. Krabs: I am the ghost of soda drink hats.  I'm here to tell you that that soda drinking hat you possess is cursed.\nSpongeBob: Cursed?\nMr. Krabs: Yes. It must belonged to some guy who's dead now.\nSpongeBob: What guy?\nMr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty something.\nSpongeBob: Smitty what?\nMr. Krabs: Uh... Smitty Werben... Jaegerman... Jensen.\nSpongeBob: He must've been number one.\nMr. Krabs: Number one in Bogeyland! Now, listen, a curse will descend on you unless you return that hat to its owner immediately.\nSpongeBob: Immediately?\nMr. Krabs: Immediately...\nSpongeBob: To its owner?\nMr. Krabs: Yes...\nSpongeBob: Right now?\nMr. Krabs: Yes, yes! It must be returned to its owner, right now.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Ahh! SpongeBob! What are you doing here?\nSpongeBob: I was just returning the cursed soda-drink hat to its original owner: Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen.\nMr. Krabs: What?! There is no Smitty Werben Jaegerman Jensen!\nSpongeBob: Sure there is. He's buried out in Floater's Cemetery.\nMr. Krabs: How did? I just... You did... I did... Gimme that shovel.\nSpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number 1!\nMr. Krabs: Huh?  Ahh!  Hold yourself together, Krabs. It's just a boneyard... filled with bones.  Ah!  What's that? It's Squidward. What's he doing here?  \"Here lies Squidward's hopes and dreams.\" What a baby. Where was I? Oh yeah. Gotta find Smitty Whatsajipster.  Nope. Nope. No. No. No. Uh-uh... No. Not there.  I've checked every headstone in this cemetery and there's no Smitty Wabbablabba buried here. Think, Krabs. Maybe something SpongeBob said will give you some type of clue.\nSpongeBob: Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets.\nMr. Krabs: No, not that!\nSpongeBob: You'll never guess what I found in my sock last night! Go ahead, guess!\nMr. Krabs: No, no, no!\nSpongeBob: It was his hat, Mr. Krabs. He was number on-\nMr. Krabs: Ah!! Barnacles! I'll never find--  The grave! Am I really going to defile this grave for money? Of course I am!  Jackpot!  Ooh. It's beautiful. Come to papa.  Hey, come on, Smitty, let go!  Rest in pieces, Smitty.  I got the million dollar hat.\nSmitty: Hey, man, that's my hat. Give it back.\nMr. Krabs: What? No way. Just crawl back into your hole, bone boy. Go ahead, play dead.\nSmitty: I guess I'm gonna have to take it from you.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, right. You and what army?\nSmitty: Only the army of the living dead.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, no. I've seen this on the late show. You ghoulish fiends hold me down and take turns nibbling on my innards. Then you eat my brain and leave my body for the buzzards.\nSmitty: That's disgusting. We just want the hat back.\nMr. Krabs: No flipping way!  Back off! Back off, I say.\nSmitty: Attack.\nMr. Krabs: Tallyho!  Look at me, I'm Errol Fin!  You're falling apart, marrow brain. You must be kidding.  Back to oblivion.  Oh, ho. How's your sister? All right, boneheads, playtime's over. Yee-hoo, ha-ha!  Wa-ha! A million dollars. I've got a million dollars!  Oh, there you are. Well, I got it. The rare novelty soda drinking hat. Let's start the bidding at one million dollars.\nFred: Yeah, you want that all at once?\nFish #3: One million dollars. You gotta be kidding!\nNat: Hey! The poor sap's not kidding. Didn't you hear? They found a whole warehouse full of them. They're worthless.\nSpongeBob: Let's give Mr. Krabs a big hand.\nNat: Now that's worth a million dollars.  Hey, kid, wait up!\nFish #2: I saw him first!\nFish #3: I'll give you one billion dollars!\nMr. Krabs: Well, that's a spirit breaker.\nSquidward: What a baby.\n","47a\nAs Seen on TV\nMr. Krabs: C'mon, Mr. Doodles.  We haven't got all day. We've got to get down to me favorite restaurant. Mine. Where we're shooting our first ever Krusty Krab commercial. After this commercial airs, we'll be swarming with customers. I can already feel myself sweatin' money.\nMr. Krabs: No, I got Squidward organizing the whole thing. He's... ya know... artsy.  What the...? This looks expensive. Out of my way. Coming through. Move it or lose it. Squidward!\nSquidward: What?\nMr. Krabs: What in Neptune's name is going on?\nSquidward: We're making the commercial, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: What you're doing is throwing away me money! I told you to rent, only, what is absolutely necessary.\nSquidward: This is all necessary.\nMr. Krabs: Then what's all this useless junk?\nSquidward: That's the useless junk for scene, uhh, 28.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, well, then how do you explain that?  A second Krusty Krab?\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, everyone needs an understudy.\nMr. Krabs: Well, you got me there. But why do we need him?\nSquidward: This job gets very stressful, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: All right, get lost, all of ya.  You're fired. Go on. Scram. Get out of here, you moochers. That's right, keep moving.  Except you. You stay.\nSquidward: Well, this is just great. Now we've got no crew to make the commercial.\nMr. Krabs: What are you talking about, Squidward? We got the cheapest crew in the world. You, me, and SpongeBob. Speaking of which, where is the little barnacle?\nSpongeBob: I'm down here, sir.\nMr. Krabs: What are you doing, lad?\nSpongeBob: Squidward said I could help by burying myself!\nMr. Krabs: Quit fooling and come on out.  I need you to be in the commercial.\nSpongeBob: Me? In the Krusty Krab commercial? Me!\nSquidward: But, but, but, but, but, but, but...\nMr. Krabs: Don't throw your buts at me, Mr. Squidward. We got a timetable to keep. This thing airs tonight.\nSpongeBob & Squidward: Tonight?!\nMr. Krabs: Yup, I got a sweet deal on the prime-time slot.\nNarrator: 3:28 am\nSpongeBob: It's almost on, Gary.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I got butterflies, too. This is the most exciting thing to happen in the history of history.\nSpongeBob: Look, Gary! It's on!\nPearl: Oh, Jen. I've got a real problem.\nSquidward: What's your problem, Amy?\nPearl: I've got all this money and I don't know what to do with it and I'm hungry.\nPearl: Who's there?\nSquidward: Where's that coming from?\nAmy and Jen: Yippee, it's Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: That's right, Amy. I heard all about your little problem and I'm here to help. Follow... me!\nAmy and Jen: Where are we?\nMr. Krabs: Why, we're at none other than the Krusty Krab.\nAmy: Did you say Krusty Krab?\nMr. Krabs: That's right, Krusty Krab. Home of the world famous Krabby Patty!\nJen: What's a Krabby Patty?\nMr. Krabs: Why, it's only the most mouthwatering appetizing food in the seven seas.\nSpongeBob: There I am, Gary! There I am!\nMr. Krabs: We start with a fresh patty, grilled and juicy. Add some crisp undersea veggies and cheese. Topped off with secret sauce and some buns. Voila! A Krabby Patty.\nAmy: I want a Krabby Patty.\nJen: Me, too.\nMr. Krabs: How do you like them Krabby Patties, girls?\nSpongeBob: Look, Gary, there I am again. Look!\nMr. Krabs: Two more satisfied customers. So why don't you come on in, and have yourself a Krabby Patty today.\nAll: \u266aThe Krusty Krab: Come Spend Your Money Here!\u266a\nSpongeBob: That was the best 60 seconds of my life! Well, time for bed.\nSpongeBob: Time to go do my favorite thing at my favorite place.\nOld Man Jenkins: Hey, you!\nSpongeBob: Top of the morning, oldster.\nOld Man Jenkins: Hey! I saw you on TV last night.\nAnnouncer: New, Bran Flakes. Bold, new taste. Bran Flakes.\nSpongeBob: You did?\nOld Man Jenkins: Yeah. You were on a commercial.\nSpongeBob: You're right! Wow, he recognized me.\nOld Man Jenkins: Yup. See ya later, Bran Flakes. What a nice cereal box.\nSpongeBob: \"Weren't you that guy on TV?\" Yes! I am that guy.  How kind of you to notice. Weren't you that guy on the television last night? Yes, that was me. I...\nSpongeBob: Oh, please excuse me, sir.\nPeterson: Oh, that's quite all right, uhh, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Wow. I'm getting recognized all over. Why, next thing you'll know, people are going to start doing things like holding doors open for...  Why, sir, I'm flattered.\nPeterson: Really? I don't smell anything.\nSpongeBob: You're on your way.\nFred: Excuse me, sir, can I get a napkin?\nSpongeBob: Why, of course, good sir. And next time, feel free to approach me. It most be so degrading to ask across the room. And who am I making this bad boy out to?\nFred: To my tail fin. I'll get it myself.\nSpongeBob: F-I-N. There we are, darling. Hmph. Looks like shyness got the best of him.\nSquidward: There you are, SpongeBob. I need you to...\nSpongeBob: No problem, Squidward. I got one already made out. Enjoy.\nSquidward: To my tailfin?\nSpongeBob: Yes, I am that guy on TV.\nTyler: Hey, look!\nSpongeBob: Please, good people, no photos at work.\nTyler: Here's the ketchup.\nSpongeBob: Well, maybe just one.  Another one? Okay. Limbo. And now, the, uh, oh, I got it.\nMr. Krabs: There you are, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Yes, pilot.\nMr. Krabs: I need you to...  ...OW!  Alright, boy. Get in there and scrub the head and stop acting so predictable.\nSpongeBob: I'm so misunderstood. Alas, good people, even the brightest of stars grow weary, and I am no exception. But I will shine again after a quick break in my quarters. Stay beautiful.\nDale: Hey, were you able to catch Glenn the Pinkfish on Flounderman last night?\nLou: No. How was he?\nDale: Well, I knew that this guy's acting was good, but his singing was phenomenal. I'm telling you, Vendor, if that guy was to cut a solo record, he'd be a hit.\nSpongeBob: Solo record!\nMr. Krabs: So, if I fire him and make his successor do twice the work, and...  ...eh, come in.  Oh, it's just you, SpongeBob. Those heads better be beautiful.\nSpongeBob: They are, Mr. Krabs, and so is mine. And now I gotta lay something on ya, Krabs Baby.\nMr. Krabs: The only thing you better lay is some patties on the grill, Fry Boy.\nSpongeBob: Nah, I can't take that gig, Krabber. That phase in my career is over. I'm an entertainer now.\nMr. Krabs: What in blazes are you talking about?\nSpongeBob: Come on, Krabs. Let's think outside the box for a second. Commercials are old-hat. The people want music. If I could change fate I would, Krabsy. And I'm an entertainer deep down. A people's person. We're on the same page here, aren't we?\nMr. Krabs: Boy, those Krabby fumes must've gotten to your head. Borrow Squidward's gas mask and get right back to work.\nSpongeBob: I knew you'd understand. Well, thanks for the start. I'm out of here.\nMr. Krabs: Oooooh... I've never felt such a strange combination of pity... and indigestion.\nBill: There he is! Hey! We've been waiting for you.\nNazz: Where have you been?\nBill: How long are you going to keep us standing here?\nSquidward: Well, SpongeBob? Are you just going to stand there like a half-wit, mouth agape? Or are you going to fill these peoples' orders?\nSpongeBob: Pipe down, Squidward. This crowd looks angry. They're not going to wait any longer. I think I better give them what they need, and fast.\nSquidward: I think so, too, or Krabs will fire both of us.  On second thought, keep 'em waiting.\nSpongeBob: No can do, Squidward. These people demand entertainment.\nSquidward: Enter-what?\nSpongeBob: How you doing, folks?\nAll: Hungry!\nSpongeBob: That's no problem, ladies and germs. 'Cause SpongeBob is here to satisfy.\nSquidward: Hey!\nBill: Eating here was your idea.\nSpongeBob: I'd like to call this little number \"Striped Sweater.\" \u266aThe best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time. One with a collar, turtleneck, that's the kind  'Cause when you're wearing...\u266a\nBill: We're starving!\nSpongeBob: \u266aThat one... special... sweater...\u266a  Squidward, this crowd is insatiable.\nSquidward: Then why don't you back in the kitchen, and grab some patties, and give them what they  came here for?!\nSpongeBob: Juggling! Thanks, Squiddy.\nNancy: Is this some kind of joke?\nSpongeBob: They want juggling and jokes at the same time? Tough crowd.\nBill: Oh, now what's he doing?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, what do you call a vampire whose car breaks down three miles from a blood bank? A cab!\nBill: We're losing our appetites!\nSpongeBob: Uh, okay. There's a nun, an astronaut, and a hairdryer.\nAll: We want patties!\nSpongeBob: Well, the most I can juggle is three, but the show must go on. Whoa!\nAll: Boo!\nSpongeBob: No!  My career is over. All those years clawing my way up. All the people I've stepped on, wasted.\nBill: Hey! Finally!\nNancy: That's what we've been waiting for.\nSpongeBob: They seem to like it when I put this patty on the grill. I may be able to save this act, yet. Roll with it, SpongeBob. Roll with it. There's more where that came from, folks.\nAll: Yay!\nSpongeBob: You like that?\nBill: It's what we wanted all along.\nSpongeBob: It seems to be working. But how do I follow it up? Buns!  It's a stretch, but we've all got to push the envelope, sometime. Okay, folks. How do you like this?\nAll: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: I'm breaking new ground. Time to get edgy.\nCustomers: We want onions! Cheese! Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Ready for the grand finale?\nAll: Whoopee! Krabby Patties!\nMr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, looks like you've finally found your calling.\nSpongeBob: I'll say. I'm so glad I gave up fry cooking for this.\n","47b\nCan You Spare a Dime?\nNarrator: Closing time at the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs: 51, 52, 53...\nSquidward: 29, 30, 31...\nSpongeBob: One, two, three. One, two, three.\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, can we please go now?\nMr. Krabs: Perhaps, one of our more loyal workers can enlighten you on company policy.\nSpongeBob: \"The Krusty Krab Employee Manual; 2nd Revised Edition; Page 35; Section 19; Clause 3a, states: All staff must remain on the premises until the day's receipts are fully accounted for\".\nSquidward: But that's not fair!\nSpongeBob: \"Clause 3b: The provider reserves the right to be unfair\".\nSquidward: Teacher's pet.\nMr. Krabs: Let's see...  ...five, ten, 25, blue, apple sauce. Everything looks to be in order. Except...  Where is it?  Where is it?\nSquidward: What?\nMr. Krabs: My dime! Me special dime, the first dime I ever made! I always keep it in the back of the register for luck!\nSquidward: Well, I've never seen it.\nMr. Krabs: Hmm, are you prepared to say that with your hand on top of a stack of interpretive dance quarterlies?\nSquidward: Of course I'm...  What are you saying?\nMr. Krabs: Me? I ain't saying nothing that would matter to anyone who would be able to take a lie detector test!\nSquidward: You're saying something!\nMr. Krabs: Heavens to Betsy, no. It's just that me lucky dime's gone missin', and you've been working the register all day!\nSquidward: Are you accusing me of something?\nMr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you stole it. Two, you stole it. Or three\u2014you stole it!\nSquidward: I didn't take your precious dime!\nMr. Krabs: Show me your tentacles.\nSquidward: What?!\nMr. Krabs: I wanna see empty suction cups.\nSquidward: Here! Here! Here! See 'em?!\nMr. Krabs: You-you can't do that to me. I'm your boss!\nSquidward: Not anymore, Mr. Krabs. I quit!\nSpongeBob: No.  Whew.\nSquidward: I'm outta here!\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you're making a big mistake!\nSquidward: Mistake? Ha! The only mistake I ever made was wasting my life at the Krusty Krab!\nSpongeBob: But a visit to the Krusty Krab makes everyone happy. And what could be better than serving up smiles?\nSquidward: Being dead or anything else!\nSpongeBob: I never knew you felt so strongly about it.\nSquidward: Where have you been?\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't stop you. But Squidward, it's a cold, cold world out there. No one's going to serve you happiness on a silver platter.\nNorma Rechid: Free sample?\nSpongeBob: Cookies!\nSquidward: Can I have one\u2013?\nSpongeBob: Anyways, I just want you to know, if you ever get in trouble, come find me. I'll take care of you. 'Cause you and me...  ...we're like brothers, only closer.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I don't need your help. I am ready to unlock my potential. I could be anything I set my mind to.  I could be a football player, or a king, or a spaceman.\nSpongeBob: Or a football playing king in space...with a mustache.\nSquidward: Yeah...uh-huh. Ya know, that reminds me, there's been something I've been wanting to say to you since the day we met... Goodbye. Next time you see me, this town will be eating out of the palm of my hands!  Spare change? Spare change, ma'am?\nSpongeBob: Squidward? Squidward, is that you?\nSquidward: Uh, I , uh...\nSpongeBob: It's me, SpongeBob.  We used to work together.\nSquidward: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: There ya go. So, where you living these days?\nFish: Squidward Tentacles?\nSquidward: Yes?\nFish: Sign here please.\nSquidward: Uh... nowhere.\nSpongeBob: Great. And what have you been doing with yourself? No, wait, let me guess...Hmmm...I see you've been working on that mustache, the tattered clothes, the awful smell...you're a football player?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: A spaceman?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: A football playing king in space--\nSquidward: Don't you get it?  I'm a lose-e-er! I lost my job, my home, everything!\nSpongeBob: Even your paintings?\nSquidward: Nobody would take them. So I had to eat them.\nSpongeBob: There, there. You can come live with me.  Here you go, Squidward. You can sleep in my bed.\nSquidward: Okay, but just until I get a job. One day...two days tops.\nSpongeBob: Nonsense. You stay as long as you need to.  Good night, my little angel.  Breakfast is ready! You're gonna need to build up your strength again so I laid out a big buffet for you.\nSquidward: And in bed, too? Aw, thanks, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, I...\nSpongeBob: Ahh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Here comes the plane.\nSquidward: It's really nice of you to help me in my time of need. I'll try not to be a burden.\nSpongeBob: It's no trouble. Is there anything else I can do for you, winner?\nSquidward: No, no, no. You've already...well...\nSpongeBob: Oh, wow. Nurturing a broken spirit sure is a lot of work. I'm bushed. Still, it feels nice to do good.  Good night, Gary.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, can I get a glass of water?  Thank you.\nSpongeBob: Good night.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, could I get some more blankets?\nSpongeBob: Here you go.\nSquidward: Thank you.  SpongeBob, you forgot to turn out the light!\nSpongeBob: Good night.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Gary! Squidward is not a freeloader and he would never take advantage of me.\nNarrator: Three weeks later...\nSpongeBob: He's just having a hard time getting his confidence back.\nNarrator: Many months later...\nSpongeBob: I'm sure he's close to a breakthrough.\nNew Narrator: So much later that the old narrator got tired of waiting and they had to hire a new one...\nGary: Meow, meow, meow.\nSpongeBob: I know he still isn't looking for work! Don't rub it in!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, where's my lemonade?\nSpongeBob: Coming, Squidward.\nSquidward: SpongeBob?! SpongeBob?!  And why aren't you in uniform?  It's about time you got here!\nSpongeBob: Here you go, Your Majesty.\nSquidward: I can't drink that.\nSpongeBob: Why not?\nSquidward: Are you blind? Just look at it.\nSpongeBob: What about it?\nSquidward: That lemon has three seeds in it. That's an odd number! I can't eat anything odd numbered.\nSpongeBob: Fine, I'll just take it out.\nSquidward: No! No! It's already contaminated by the bad lemon! It won't work!\nSpongeBob: Hmm, that's two things in this house that won't work.\nSquidward: Then go fix them.\nSpongeBob: Two things that won't work!\nSquidward: I've changed my mind. I want soup instead.\nSpongeBob: Okay. Don't move.  Here you go. It's alphabet soup. I made it special.\nSquidward: Condensed soup from a can? Disgusting! Now you've ruined my appetite! Go fetch me something to read!\nSpongeBob: Oh, okay. How about this?\nSquidward: Get that away from me! You know I'm allergic to newsprint!\nSpongeBob: Ya know, when you swatted that newspaper out of my hands, it reminded me of something a friend of mine did...at his job!\nSquidward: 4 o'clock. Time for my stories. Hurry up, they won't hold the show while you laze around.\nPuppet #1: Hey, where are you going?\nPuppet #2: To my job.\nPuppet #1: You have a job?\nPuppet #2: Why wouldn't I? I'm not some lazy, inconsiderate jerk who lays in bed all day.\nPuppet #1: Say, where can I get one of these...jobs?\nPuppet #2: Oh, they're everywhere.  Especially if you're green and have six tentacles.\nPuppet #1: Thanks. I'm gonna go look for one so I can stop...\nSpongeBob: ...mooching off my friends and they can get back to their lives!\nSquidward: This isn't my show.  SpongeBob, the remote control is broken! Get over here and fix it!\nSpongeBob: I've got a better idea!  Why don't I call someone whose job it is to fix it? You know why? Because when I want a job  done I get someone with a job  to do  that JOB!\nSquidward: What are you saying?\nMr. Krabs: Donate to the children's fund? Why? What have children ever done for me?\nSpongeBob: You want your dime back?!  Take it! Now Squidward can come back, right?\nMr. Krabs: Wrong.  That ain't my first dime.\nSpongeBob: Then have some more dimes!  I've got plenty of 'em!\nMr. Krabs: You can't put a price on me first dime! And I can't forgive that thieving bilge rat, Squidward for stealing it!\nSpongeBob: Listen, you crustaceous cheapskate! Squidward's been living at my house driving me crazy!  And you're not gonna hire him back all because of a stupid dime?!  What's that?\nMr. Krabs: Me first dime.  Oh, \"dimey,\" I'll never lose you again.\nSpongeBob: This is a dime?\nMr. Krabs: I've been in business a long time, boy.\nSpongeBob: So, if Squidward never stole the dime, he can come back to work, right?\nMr. Krabs: Aye, lad, just let the dime and me have our privacy.\nMr. Krabs: Well, Mr. Squidward, it's good to have ya back.\nSquidward: Well, it's kind of good to be back, sir.\nMr. Krabs: It's all water under the bridge now.\nSquidward: I agree, sir.\nMr. Krabs: After all, I'm sure ya didn't mean to misplace me dime.\nSquidward: What the...? What are you saying?\nMr. Krabs: Well, it's obvious that ya put the dime in me pants. Dimes just don't fly into people's pants.\nSquidward: Are you accusing me of something?\nMr. Krabs: Well, the way I see it there are three possibilities: One, you put the dime in me pants.  Two, you put the dime in me pants. Or three\u2014you put the dime in me pants!\n","48a\nNo Weenies Allowed\nNarrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon, a luxurious oasis of sand and sea.\nSandy: Shee-oot, SpongeBob. How are we gonna go swimmin' when you're in a shirt and tie?\nSpongeBob: Ah, yes. How foolish of me.  Allow me to remedy said situation right now. I will just use this changing tent here to change into my bathing suit.  And I won't do anything else.\nSandy: SpongeBob's actin' jumpier than a rattlesnake in a pickle barrel. Wait... what?\nSpongeBob: Oh, I'll be changing, alright, but not into a bathing suit. Wait until Sandy sees that I brought my karate gear! Hi-yah!  Hi-yah!  Sandy won't beat me this time, because I've got the elements on my side. The elements of surprise. Hi-yah!\nSandy: SpongeBob, are you ready?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Sandy, I most certainly am ready!  Ready to get it on.  Hi...\nSandy: Hi-yah!  Look, SpongeBob, we both brought our karate gear.\nSpongeBob: Great minds think alike, I suppose.\nSandy: Hi-yah!\nSpongeBob: I may be down, but I'm not out!\nTom: Way to go, buddy. It took us three days to make that potato salad.  Three days!\nSpongeBob: Hi-yah! Sandy?\nSandy: Oh, I'm Sandy, alright.  I'm very Sandy.  Hi-yah!\nSpongeBob: Oh, I get it. She's \"Sandy.\" That's her name; she's also covered in... yes!\nSandy: Back in Texas, we call ice cream \"frozen cow juice\". Excuse me for a sec. Hi-yah!  Thank you.\nIce Cream Vendor: No, no, thank you.\nSandy: Hi-yah!\nTough Fish #1: Who threw that piece of paper at me?\nSandy: Hey, what's everybody waitin' in line for?\nTough Fish #1: Ahoy, fair lass, it be the line to get into the Salty Spitoon \u2014  the roughest, toughest sailor club ever to be built under the seven seas. Only the baddest of the bad can get in. You need to have muscles.  You need to have muscles on your muscles.  You need to have muscles on your eyeballs!\nSpongeBob: Ew.\nSandy: Looks like a rip-snortin' good time, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, let's go in.\nReg: Go ahead.  Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?\nTough Fish #1: How tough am I? How tough am I?! I had a bowl of nails for breakfast this morning!\nReg: Yeah, so?\nTough Fish #1: Without any milk.\nReg: Uhh, right this way, sorry to keep you waiting.  Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?\nSandy: How tough am I?\nSpongeBob: Wow.\nSandy: Got any more tattoos?\nReg: Uhh, that won't be necessary. Go ahead.\nSandy: Thanks. See ya inside, SpongeBob!\nReg: How tough are ya?\nSpongeBob: How tough am I? You got a new bottle of ketchup?\nReg: Sure.\nSpongeBob: It's on!  If I could just run this under some hot water...\nReg: Get outta here. This place is too tough for you, little man.\nSpongeBob: Too tough for me? That's downright ridiculous. I'll have you know I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden, and I only cried for twenty minutes.\nReg: Listen, kid. I think you'd be more comfortable over at that place.\nSpongeBob: Weenie Hut Jr's? Are you saying I belong in Weenie Hut Jr's?\nReg: Uhh. Oh, no, sorry, I was actually pointing at the place next to it.\nSpongeBob: Super Weenie Hut Jr's?\nReg: Yeah. Unless you think you're tough enough to fight me.\nNerd #1: How's your collection coming along?\nNerd #2: Well, I don't mean to brag, but it's pretty sweet. I'm in the process of acquiring issue 347 which will give me my fourth complete set.\nNerd #1: No...\nSpongeBob: What weenies. Oh, brother.\nRobot: Would you care for another diet cola with a lemon twist, weenie?\nSpongeBob: What? But I'm not a weenie!\nRobot: I'm sorry, sir, but my sensors indicate that you are indeed a weenie.\nSpongeBob: That's impossible!\nRobot: You can't hide what's inside.\nSpongeBob: I demand entrance into your club on the grounds that I am not a weenie!\nTough Fish #4: Hey, Reg, how's it going?\nReg: You were sayin'?  Go ahead, buddy.\nTough Fish #4: Thanks, Reg.\nSpongeBob: So, your name's Reg?\nReg: Would you get outta here?\nSpongeBob: Mark my words, Reg. I will get into the Salty Spitoon! I will!\nNerd #1: Couldn't get in, huh? What you need is a tough hairdo. No one gets into the Double S without a tough hairdo.\nNerd #2: I disagree, I saw a guy going in there and he was bald.\nNerd #1: I saw that guy. He wasn't bald. He had a shaved head. Shaved \u2014 that's a hairdo. Case closed.  Hey, where'd he go?\nRobot: I believe he said something about going to the wig store.\nNerd #1: Ha-ha! Check and mate.\nDrifter: What's shakin', my man?\nReg: Not much. Say, haven't I seen you before?\nDrifter: Doubt it \u2014 I'm a drifter \u2014 just blew into town. Heard your club was pretty tough, thought I'd check it out.\nReg: Nice try, kid. I know it's you.\nDrifter: What're you talking about?\nReg: Aha!\nSpongeBob: Hey, everybody, what's goin' on?\nReg: Ah, you can go in. Sorry about that.  Well, what do you want?\nSpongeBob: I'd like to gain entrance to your social club, please. I believe my hairdo is in order.  So, uhh, where do you stand on the whole bald vs. shaved debate?\nTough Fish #5: Hey-ya, Reg.\nReg: Alright, now it's a party! Oh, yeah, check out the new ink.\nTough Fish #5: Thanks. Hey, look what I can make it do.\nReg: Yeah. Hey, what about that one?\nTough Fish #5: Huh, you know, I don't remember getting this one.\nReg: Can you make it dance?\nTough Fish #5: Well, here, let me try.\nReg: Hmmm, wait a minute.  Go ahead in.\nTough Fish #5: Yeah, sure, Reg. Thanks.\nReg: Nice try, little man.\nTough Fish #6: Hey, I was in front of you!\nTough Fish #7: No, you weren't!\nTough Fish #6: You callin' me a liar?\nTough Fish #7: I ain't callin' you for dinner!\nReg: Hold it, you two! That's enough, you're both plenty tough, go ahead in.\nTough Fish #6: Alright!\nTough Fish #7: Thanks, Reg.\nSpongeBob: Hey, what about me? I was in that scrap.\nReg: I saw you runnin'. When you get in a real fight, then we'll talk.\nSpongeBob: Well, then, I guess it's time to take it up a notch.\nRobot: Care for another sundae, weenie?\nSpongeBob: I am not a weenie!\nNerd #1: Relax, you're among friends.\nSpongeBob: My friends don't hang out at Weenie Hut Jr's.\nPatrick: You tell 'em, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what're you doing here?\nPatrick: I'm always here on Double Weenie Wednesdays.\nNerd #1: Actually, they moved Double Weenie Wednesday to Friday.\nNerd #2: And besides, today's Monday.\nPatrick: Oh, so it's Mega Weenie Monday?\nNerd #1: Uhh, that's now on Sunday.\nPatrick: Barnacles!\nNerd #2: Super Weenie Hut Jr's has a Mega Weenie Monday.\nNerd #1: Uhh, no, you're thinking of Monster Weenie Monday.\nSpongeBob: I don't have time for this! I've got to go pick a fight with a muscular stranger! It's the only way of getting into the Salty Spitoon!\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob, you can't. It's too dangerous.\nSpongeBob: I've got no choice.\nRobot: I have a suggestion. Why not fake a fight?\nPatrick: Hey, that's not a bad idea! You can call me a couple of bad names, we rumble, next thing you know, you're in the Salty Spitoon.\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I've got nothing to lose. Let's do it!\nPatrick: Yeah!\nNerd #1: Hey, how come you never help us out with our problems?\nRobot: I am a robot, not a miracle worker.\nSpongeBob: Afternoon, Reg.\nReg: Whoa, whoa, little man. You still can't go in.\nSpongeBob: Well, that makes me pretty mad.\nReg: Oh yeah?\nSpongeBob: Yeah. I might have to beat someone up just to get rid of all this blind fury.\nReg: Wow.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I feel pretty sorry for the next guy who looks at me funny.\nReg: Hmmm... what about that guy?\nSpongeBob: I, uhh...  don't be silly. He's not botherin' anybody. I mean, not like... that guy!\nPatrick: Who, me?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, you. Standing there all smiling and whatnot. Somebody oughta teach you some manners!\nPatrick: Okay, but I must warn you. I happen to be a world championship... uhh...  ...kick boxer.\nSpongeBob: I don't care if you're the demon seed of Davy Jones! You're goin' down, Tubby!\nPatrick: Tubby?  Grr! Nobody calls me Tubby!\nSpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, you're supposed to let me win, remember?\nPatrick: Oh yeah.  No, please wait.  No, please, have mercy!\nReg: Wow! You destroyed that guy without even touchin' him.\nSpongeBob: I did?\nReg: I never thought I'd say this, but go ahead in.\nSpongeBob: Really? I can go in? Oh, my gosh, I never thought this moment would come! I, SpongeBob SquarePants, am tough enough to get into the Salty Spitoon! This is the happiest day of my life!  Sandy?  What happened?\nSandy: You ran inside and slipped on an ice cube.\nDoctor: What happened?\nSpongeBob: I slipped on an ice cube and got covered in boo-boos.\nDoctor: Boo-boos, eh? Hmmm... I think you guys want that hospital.\nSpongeBob: Weenie Hut General?\n","48b\nSquilliam Returns\nSquidward: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.  I'm done with my shift, Mr. Krabs! And let me just say, there will come a day when I will make something of my life and I will never have to set foot in this grease trap again!\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, we'll see you after your lunch break, Squidward.\nSquidward: Okay.\nSquilliam: So, I just took my private yacht across my private lake to my private heliport. It's the only way off my private island.\nSquidward: Oh, shrimp! It's my arch rival from high school, Squilliam Fancyson! I can't let him see me in my Krusty Krab uniform.\nSquilliam: On your lunch break, eh, Squiddy?\nSquidward: Yes... I mean no... I mean... uhh, uhh... Hey, whatcha been up to?\nSquilliam: Oh, just succeeding in everything you've failed in.\nSquidward: You are no great shakes, Squilliam Fancyson. Anyone can be a big shot in a hick town like Bikini Bottom.\nSquilliam: Oh, is that so? Let's hear what you've accomplished since high school, Squiddy.\nSquidward: Don't be intimidated, Squidward. Try to imagine him in his underwear.  Oh, no, he's hot!  I'm, uhh, in... food service.\nSquilliam: Hold it, don't tell me. You're a cashier!\nSquidward: Don't lie. Lying always makes it worse.  I own a five-star restaurant!\nSquilliam: Squidward, I had no idea you were such a success.\nSquidward: That's right.\nSquilliam: And I would be honored if you would allow me to come to your restaurant tonight.\nSquidward: T-t-t-t-t-t-tonight?\nSquilliam: In fact, we'll all come. My treat!\nSquidward: Please, Mr. Krabs, you got to help me! When they get here tonight, they're going to see I'm just a big phony and a loser!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, boo-hoo! Let me play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin.\nSquidward: This is serious.\nMr. Krabs: I know. This really is the world's smallest violin.  See?\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs! Please let me run the restaurant for just one night! I really need to impress Squilliam.\nMr. Krabs: Scrih- Scray- Screh- Squilliam?  That guy who made millions doing what you wish you could do?\nSquidward: Don't rub it in.\nMr. Krabs: Why didn't you tell me? We'll take him to the cleaners.\nSquidward: Alright, listen up. Men, Squilliam Fancyson will be here in twenty minutes. Therefore, we need to turn the Krusty Krab into a fancy restaurant as soon as possible.  Patrick, what are you doing here?\nPatrick: I thought the Corps would help me straighten out my life, sir!\nSquidward: The Corps? What the... Pat, this isn't the... oh!  Beggars can't be choosers. Can you take hats in a dignified and sophisticated manner?\nPatrick: You mean like a weenie? Okay!  May I take your hat, sir? May I take your hat, sir? May I...\nSquidward: Alright, I've heard enough. You've got the job.  Mr. Krabs, didn't you once serve on the S.S. Gourmet?\nMr. Krabs: Aye-aye!\nSquidward: Then you'll be our chef.\nSpongeBob: What can I do?\nSquidward: I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob, you're going to have to be the waiter.\nSpongeBob: What's that?\nSquidward: It's the guy who goes to tables and takes orders.\nSpongeBob: Do other restaurants do that?\nSquidward: Yes, they do that! Now listen, Squilliam is on his way and you have less than twenty minutes to become a fancy waiter, so read this.\nSpongeBob: \"How To Become a Fancy Waiter in Less Than 20 Minutes.\" Don't worry, Squidward, I'll memorize every page, right down to the punctuation marks!\nSquidward: Alright, I've got all the positions filled. I just might pull this off!\nPatrick: Gimme that hat!  I said give it to me! Are you gonna hand it over or not? Don't you back-sass me!\nSquidward: He's just the hat-check guy, nothing essential!  What happened? What is it?\nMr. Krabs: Peas!  Made 'em the old-fashioned way.\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, you gotta take them out of the...  Holy fish paste, what is that?!\nMr. Krabs: That's the appetizer.\nSquidward: But I thought you said you were the head chef on the S.S. Gourmet?\nMr. Krabs: Did I say that? No, I cleaned the bathrooms on the Gourmet. I was the head chef on the S.S. Diarrhea.\nSquidward: There you are! SpongeBob, you gotta help me!  Patrick and Mr. Krabs aren't working out, and Squilliam's almost here, and, and... SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I can't do it. I can't do it, Squidward!\nSquidward: What?\nSpongeBob: Every sentence, every paragraph...  Spoons! Bread! Salad! Pepper! Don't you understand?!  My brain is full to bursting! If I have to memorize a single order, I think I'm gonna explode!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, hold on! Let's just take a second here to relax.  Little more.  Little more.  Good. Now, I want you to empty your mind.\nSpongeBob: Empty my mind?\nSquidward: Empty your mind.\nSpongeBob: Empty my mind...\nSquidward: Empty your mind of everything that doesn't have to do with fine dining. Fine dining and breathing.\nSmaller SpongeBob #1: Just got an order from the boss: Dump everything that isn't about fine dining!\nOther Smaller SpongeBobs: Everything?\nSpongeBob #1: Everything!  Come on, come on, come on! Bring 'em, bring 'em, bring 'em! Jellies, jellies!  Let's go, let's go! Keep doing it!  Come on, let's get moving!  Hurry up! What do you think I'm paying you for?\nSmaller SpongeBob #2: You don't pay me. We don't even exist. We're just a clever visual metaphor used to personify the abstract concept of thought.\nSmaller SpongeBob #1: One more crack like that and you're out of here!\nSmaller SpongeBob #2: No, please! I have three kids!\nSquidward: How do you feel?  SpongeBob?  This isn't working! I gotta go tell Squilliam I need more time!  I'll just go to Squilliam's house and...  Squilliam, you're here!\nSquilliam: Hello, Squiddy!  We're all ready to be dazzled by your five-star restaurant.\nSquidward: Wait, Squilliam, I've got to explain!\nSquilliam: Explain what? That you, Squidward Tentacles, voted most likely to suck eggs in high school,  are trying to pass off a lousy burger stand as a five-star...  ...restaurant!?  Hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina, hommina...\nSpongeBob: Table for Hommina? I can seat you immediately!\nSquidward: How did you do all this?\nSpongeBob: It was easy, once I cleared my mind.\nSquidward: But what about Krabs and Patrick?\nSpongeBob: Taken care of.  Right this way, please.  Good evening, sir.  From our menu tonight, might I recommend the Krabby Newburg?  We take the finest cuts of aged, imported kelp, stuff them with herbs from our garden, wrap them in parchment with our award-winning shallot tapenade, slow-roast them for six hours in our wood-fired, clay-filled oven, or kiva, and serve them with a garnish of wilted coral on a mahogany plank.\nSquilliam: Mmm... this is fantastic!\nSpongeBob: Thank you, sir.\nSquidward: Pinch me, I must be dreaming.  Ow!\nSpongeBob: If you need anything else, just call.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I can't thank you enough for all you're doing!\nSpongeBob: Fine dining and breathing are all I know how to do.\nSquidward: It worked. I can't believe it! Squilliam thinks I own a five-star restaurant. Time to rub it in his face.  Well, Squilliam, I'm waiting.\nSquilliam: Alright, I admit it. Everything is fabulous. The food, the atmosphere! Everything's flawless!\nSquidward: In that case, I need you to read this.\nSquilliam: Uhh, \"Squidward Tentacles...\"\nSquidward: And I need you to wear this.\nSquilliam: Oh, eh, \"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest...\"\nSquidward: I'm sorry, one more time.\nSquilliam: \"Squidward Tentacles has the fanciest restaurant in Bikini Bottom... and he does not suck eggs.\"  Squidward, I must tell you...  Thank you. What really won me over was your brilliant waiter. It's as if all he knows is fine dining... and breathing. I must know your name.\nSpongeBob: My name?\nSquilliam: Yes, your name, son.\nSpongeBob: Uhh... Beef Wellington?\nSquilliam: No, your name.\nSpongeBob: Uhh... err... the fork on the left?\nSquidward: Heh. Stop joking. Tell him your name.\nSpongeBob: My name?\nSmaller SpongeBob #3: What's his name?! What's his name?! I've got nothing on a name!\nSmaller SpongeBob #4: Come on, baby, what's the name?!?\nSmaller SpongeBob #5: We threw out his name!\nSquidward: I am so very sorry! I don't know what has gotten into that...\nSpongeBob: More soup for your armpit?\nSpongeBob: Please enjoy the food!  Would you like some cheese on that, sir?\nSquidward: No! Nooo!\nMr. Krabs: Run for your lives, everyone! It's the appetizer!\nSquilliam: Well, Squiddy, I'm waiting.\nSquidward: Okay, I admit it, I'm a fraud! This was all a futile, pathetic attempt to impress you. This isn't really my restaurant. I'm just a cashier!\nSquilliam: Squidward, I understand. I have a confession to make myself. I made everything up about my life. I have no yachts, jets, or anything. I was only trying to impress you. The horrible, sad truth is, I'm a cashier, too!\nSquidward: Is that true?\nSquilliam: Of course not! I'm filthy stinking rich! Come on, everyone. Let's all take a ride in my balloon/casino!\nSpongeBob: Ugh, I got such a headache. What's going on with you?\nSquidward: Oh, the usual.  Would you get out of here!?\n","49a\nKrab Borg\nTV: We now return to tonight's Creepy Time Theater presentation of Night of the Robot.\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Gary, the scary robot movie's on.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: What do you mean I shouldn't watch this? Scary movies don't always freak me out.  What if Mom is a robot? What if Uncle Sherm is a robot? What if Gary is a robot? Gary?  Psst, Gary? Gare-Bear?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Gary, if you were a robot, you'd tell me, right?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I've got nothing to worry about. And now to get a good night's sleep.  Robot! Oh my gosh!  Huh?\nMr. Krabs: How about a little music to count me money to?\nRadio DJ: And now for the #1 song in Bikini Bottom: \"Electric Zoo.\"\nMr. Krabs: Hey, that's pretty catchy. Bee-bee-boo-bop, bee-bee-boo-beep. Yeah, that's not bad. I love this young people's music.\nSpongeBob: I surrender! Oh.\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Squidward, why are you wearing my hat on your nose?\nSquidward: I'm not wearing your hat on my nose! I'm waiting for #17's order!\nSpongeBob: #17 --  Krabby Patty and a medium beverage. Course. Sorry Squidward, I'm not really feeling myself today. I guess I'm a little bit jumpy. I keep thinking robots are taking over the world, probably on account of this movie I watched last night where robots take over the world. I even asked Gary if he was a robot! Pretty funny, huh?\nSquidward: Hilarious. Just deliver the food.\nSpongeBob: There you go! Enjoy your... Say, you're not a robot, are you?\nThaddeus: No, I'm not.\nSpongeBob: Well, keep your eyes peeled.  They're everywhere. Back to work!\nMr. Krabs: I feel completely recharged!\nSpongeBob: That sounds like Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Come on, little buddy, play it again.  Please? One more time, for me.\nSpongeBob: That was strange. Mr. Krabs was talking to his radio, and he said he feels \"recharged.\"  If I didn't know better, I'd say he was...  ...a robot! Nah.\nMr. Krabs: Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could play that song again.\nRadio DJ: Hmmm... which one, man?\nMr. Krabs: The one that goes \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.\"\nRadio DJ: No, man. You're thinking of \"bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bop.\"\nMr. Krabs: Bee-boo-boo-boo-boo-bop,  bee-boo-boo-bop,  boo-boo-bee-bop?  Not bee-boo-boo-beep?  Bop?  Beep?!  Boo-boo-bop?!\nSpongeBob: Oh my gosh. Why was Mr. Krabs making all those beeping sounds? Could it be that he's...  ...a robot? Nah.  Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! Mr. Krabs... talking to radio... beeping sounds... strange dancing... robot!\nSquidward: That's great, SpongeBob. Why don't you work on this problem back in the kitchen!\nSpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward! Mr. Krabs is a robot. And I can prove it, too.\nSquidward: How did you...?\nSpongeBob: Let's see, in the movie the robots didn't have a sense of humor! They couldn't laugh. Hey, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: What is it, boy?\nSpongeBob: Squidward just told me a hilarious joke and I thought you might like to hear it.\nMr. Krabs: Is it true, Squidward? Is it hilarious?\nSquidward: Umm... yeah, sure.\nMr. Krabs: Well, let's hear it, lad.\nSpongeBob: Okay, here it goes! Uhh, how'd it go Squidward?\nSquidward: Uhh, it went, umm, uhh, let's see, uhh... why couldn't the 11-year-old get into the pirate movie?\nMr. Krabs: Why?\nSquidward: It was rated \"Arr!\" Arr! Because it's... about... pirates.\nMr. Krabs: I'm not paying you to do stand up, Mr. Squidward! Now get back to work!\nSpongeBob: Not even a chuckle! See, Squidward? He didn't laugh because he couldn't laugh because he's...  ...a robot!\nSquidward: There's a logical explanation why he didn't laugh, SpongeBob. He's obviously heard it before. The only reason you think Krabs is a robot is because you watched that stupid movie. Now why don't you...\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: What? What is it, boy?\nSpongeBob: Squidward's father never hugged him. Isn't that sad?\nMr. Krabs: Yes, I suppose that is rather sad, but Squidward can hug himself during his break! Now get back to work!\nSpongeBob: Just like the robot in the movie. He couldn't cry either.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll have you know my father loved me very much!\nSpongeBob: That's the final test, Squidward; the love test. Robots can't love.\nSquidward: No, wait, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: What is it, SpongeBob?!\nSpongeBob: I just wanted to tell you that Squidward loves you!\nMr. Krabs: Get back to work, Mr. Squidward.\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\nMr. Krabs: Aw, me radio died!  Hmmm, these batteries still have a little juice in 'em. I know! I'll give 'em to Pearl for Christmas.  Me hard-boiled egg is ready!  I can already taste it. Come to Papa.  Got ya! And what good is a hot-boiled egg without a little salt?\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Ahhh! Oh, my eyes!\nSpongeBob: Mr...\nSquidward: Will you be quiet? Now listen, what did these robots in the movie look like?\nSpongeBob: Well, they had piercing red eyes, metal pinchers for hands, and they ran on batteries.\nSquidward: Okay, so tell me, does Mr. Krabs look anything like that?!\nSquidward: I'll evacuate the customers, you call the navy!\nSpongeBob: Hello, Operator? Get me the Navy!\nOperator: Hello, you've reached the Navy's automated phone service.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, the robots are running the Navy!\nSquidward: Not the Navy!  Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world!  Our world!  What do we do now?\nSpongeBob: I don't know!  Hey, a nickel!\nSquidward: SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\nMr. Krabs: Ah, that's better.  Bee-boo-boo-boo-bee-bop, boo-boo-bop.\nSquidward: We need to find out what that robot did with the real Mr. Krabs, but how?\nSpongeBob: Well, in the movie the hero teams up with a buddy, and they get the poop on the robot.\nSquidward: They poop on the robot?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, you know, they get the straight poop, ask questions, get information.\nSquidward: I never thought I'd say this, but, SpongeBob, let's get that poop!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, hello, boys.  What can I do for you?  Heh-heh, why did you lock the door?  Why do you have that rope? Who's watching the cash register?!  SpongeBob! Squidward! What's the meaning of this?! Untie me this instant!\nSquidward: Shut up!\nMr. Krabs: Sweet Davy Jones, what the heck is going on?!\nSquidward: I said \"shut up!,\" you bucket of bolts!\nSpongeBob: I can't take it!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, are you okay?\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, seeing you slap Mr. Krabs like that is just too horrible to watch!\nSquidward: No, that's not Mr. Krabs. That's Robot Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah.\nSquidward: And the only way to deal with these robot types is to find out what they know.\nSpongeBob: Right.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you got to ask him a question first.\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah. What color is my underwear?\nSquidward: SpongeBob, let me handle this.  Where's Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Krabs.\nSquidward: We can do this all night if you want. Where's Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I'm Mr. Krabs.\nSquidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I am Mr. Krabs! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am! I am!\nSpongeBob: This is one stubborn robot.\nMr. Krabs: What?!  You think I'm a robot?!\nSquidward: We don't think; we know.\nMr. Krabs: That's the silliest thing I ever heard! I am Mr. Krabs!\nSquidward: He's not cracking. We'll never get it out of him this way.\nSpongeBob: I got an idea.  Keep an eye on him, Squidward. Don't fall for any of his robot tricks.  If Robot Krabs won't tell us where Mr. Krabs is, maybe one of his little robot friends will.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, uhh, that's a blender.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but I saw Mr. Krabs talking with his radio before. He called it his \"little buddy.\"\nSquidward: Oh, really? Put it on the table, SpongeBob.\nMr. Krabs: You're gonna interrogate my blender? You're crazy.\nSquidward: We're just gonna see what your \"little buddy\" knows.\nMr. Krabs: No, wait! What are you going to do with me blender?! That cost me money!\nSquidward: Where's Mr. Krabs?  Not talking, eh?\nMr. Krabs: No! That cost me $24.95!\nSpongeBob: I guess it didn't know anything.\nSquidward: Go get the toaster.\nMr. Krabs: No, not me toaster. That cost me $32.50!  $62.67!  Four... well, actually, that one was a gift.  Nooo!\nSpongeBob: This is the last robot, Squidward.\nMr. Krabs: No, not my cash register! I raised it myself. I got it when it was just a little calculator.  No!\nSquidward: I thought you said robots can't cry.\nSpongeBob: I also said they couldn't love.\nMr. Krabs: I loved it like it was me own.\nSpongeBob: Uh, at least he's not laughing.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I remember the laughs we used to share!\nSquidward: SpongeBob uhh, how did that movie of yours end?\nSpongeBob: The movie? Oh, yeah! The ending was great! Turns out there weren't any robots after all. It was just their...  imagination.  Hey, it's time to feed Gary.\nMr. Krabs: Squidward!\n","49b\nRock-a-Bye Bivalve\nSpongeBob: Gary, the paper's here!  You can have this, buddy. 'Cause all I need is the entertainment section!  I am a happy sponge!\nGary: Meow.\nPatrick: I see you got the paper.\nSpongeBob: Oh, hey, Patrick.  Well, I'd better get going.\nPatrick: Yep, see you later.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: What did you say?\nPatrick: Well, I didn't say anything.\nSpongeBob: I didn't say anything, either.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: See you later then.\nSpongeBob: Alright, quit messing with me, I know you said something.\nPatrick: Ah, but it is you  that is messing with me.  That's what's messing with us.\nSpongeBob: It's a baby scallop.\nPatrick: I'll take care of this!\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick! It's totally helpless.  It looks like he can't even fly yet.\nPatrick: What's the matter, is he stupid?\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just a baby.  He's all alone with no one to take care of him.\nPatrick: Well, we can't just leave him out here.\nSpongeBob: You're right. Come on, let's take him into the pineapple.  Hmmm, let's see, we need a box for him to sleep in.  There you go. It's the best seat  in the house.\nPatrick: Let me see!  Hey, he's kinda cute. Uh-oh!  I think somebody's hungry!\nSpongeBob: Is it true? Are you hungry?\nJunior: Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!\nSpongeBob: I've got just the thing.  How would you like a Krabby Patty?\nPatrick: SpongeBob SquarePants, are you crazy? That's not the right food for a little fella like him!\nSpongeBob: Of course not. I don't know what I was thinking. What he needs is a tiny Krabby Patty.\nJunior: Blech!\nSpongeBob: Huh? No one's ever turned down one of these before.\nPatrick: Let's try a donut.\nSpongeBob: French fries?\nJunior: Unh-unh.\nPatrick: A donut?\nSpongeBob: All we have left is this apple.\nWorm: Hello, sea creatures! I bring you greetings from Apple World!\nSpongeBob: Of course, scallops love worms.\nWorm: Huh, wait! We will bury you!\nSpongeBob: Well, you should be good for the rest of the...\nPatrick: What now?\nSpongeBob: I don't know! Aww, don't cry.\nPatrick: Do something, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Uhh...uhh...uhh... Blah-blah-blah, look at the funny face! Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, look at the funny face!  Look at the funny face!\nPatrick: Wait. I think I might know the problem.  Yep, that's it, alright.  Hold on just one second. There he is, good as new.\nSpongeBob: How did you know?\nPatrick: How do you think?  And I've been doing it all by myself for almost a year.\nSpongeBob: Wow, I'm sure glad you're here.\nPatrick: I know, good thing there's two of us.\nSpongeBob: You know, Patrick, since this scallop doesn't have parents, we should raise it ourselves.\nPatrick: Yeah. At least until it's old enough to be on its own! Oh, I wanna be the mom.\nSpongeBob: I don't think you can be the mom, Patrick, because you never wear a shirt.\nPatrick: You're right. If I was a mom..., ...this would be kind of shocking.  Just call me Daddy!\nPatrick: It sure is cute when it's asleep.\nSpongeBob: Yeah.  Shh!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\nPatrick: I never thought being a parent could be this much fun.\nSpongeBob: Me neither.\nPatrick: Well, good night, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.  Patrick, breakfast is ready.\nPatrick: Alright. All this parenting stuff makes me hungry.  Hey, Junior, how are you doing today?  SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\nPatrick: Kid's got a stinky.\nSpongeBob: Can you take care of him? My hands are kind of full.\nPatrick: Ahh. Wish I could, but I gotta get going.\nSpongeBob: Going? Where are you going?\nPatrick: I'm goin' to work. I'm the dad, remember?\nSpongeBob: You mean I have to do all this baby stuff myself?\nPatrick: I'll give you a break tonight when I get home. Don't you two stop being adorable.\nSpongeBob: Okay.\nPatrick: Phew, what a day.\nSpongeBob: Oh, great, you're home. Now you can help me with the baby.\nPatrick: Aw, gee, SpongeBob, I'd love to, but I'm totally beat from work.\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nPatrick: That guy got hit in the head with a coconut!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what about my break?\nPatrick: Oh yeah, your break. Uh, tomorrow, I promise.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, okay, tomorrow.\nNarrator: Tomorrow...\nPatrick: Phew, another tough day.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Patrick, I'm so glad you're home after working all day. I can't wait for my break.\nPatrick: Work was a killer. I need my chair.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I really need my...\nPatrick: Tomorrow for sure.\nNarrator: Tomorrow for sure...\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\nPatrick: I'll get to it eventually...\nNarrator: Eventually...\nSpongeBob: Uhhh?\nPatrick: Uhhh.\nNarrator: Uhhh...\nSpongeBob: Patrick Star, we need to talk.\nPatrick: Just one more minute, I gotta...\nSpongeBob: Don't 'one more minute' me, Mr. Man!\nPatrick: Hey, I'm missin' the coconut!\nSpongeBob: You haven't been helping at all with Junior!  We made a commitment and you're not doing your share! You never do anything.\nPatrick: I changed his diaper!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, once.\nPatrick: He's only this big.  How many diapers could he possibly use?\nSpongeBob: Hmmm?\nPatrick: Oh, that's not so much.\nSpongeBob: Hmmm?\nPatrick: So?\nSpongeBob: Hmmm?  Hmmm?  Hmmm!?\nPatrick: I have no idea! What kind of a father am I?! Oh!  I'll make it up to you, buddy. I promise.\nSpongeBob: So, what's the plan for the day?\nPatrick: No more foolin' around. From now on, I'm Super-Dad! I'll work straight through lunch so I can get home on time. So make sure you save a big ol' stinky diaper for me to change, and you can take the night off, pal.\nSpongeBob: Great, so I'll see you at six o'clock.\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\nSpongeBob: Six o'clock.\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\nSpongeBob: Six o'clock.\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\nSpongeBob: Six o'clock.\nPatrick: Six o'clock.\nNarrator: 12:00 midnight.\nPatrick: Oh, that was some party.  Oh, hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Junior.  What? What?\nSpongeBob: Oh, nothing.\nPatrick: Oh, what a relief.  For a second there, I thought you were mad at me.\nSpongeBob: Do you remember what you said to me this morning?\nPatrick: Somethin' about root beer, right?\nSpongeBob: No.\nPatrick: Oh wait, wait, let me guess. I give up.\nSpongeBob: Does...  \"You can take the night off, pal!\"  ...ring a bell?\nPatrick: I don't need this.\nSpongeBob: What?!  Where do you think you're going?\nPatrick: I'm going back to work.\nSpongeBob: Work?!\nPatrick: He got hit in the head with two coconuts!\nSpongeBob: So, this is work?\nPatrick: You know, it's not as easy as it looks. Sometimes, I gotta move the antenna, sometimes, I lose the remote,  and sometimes, my butt itches real bad!\nSpongeBob: Oh, you poor, poor thing. By the way, you forgot your briefcase!\nPatrick: Oh, so this is the thanks I get for working overtime?\nSpongeBob: Overtime?!\nPatrick: Yeah, overtime, pal.\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy, yeah, you're working!\nPatrick: You know what that means?\nSpongeBob: And that's the kind of work you're doing?\nPatrick: \u200bIt means working when you're just too tired to work!\nSpongeBob: Show me where I can sign up for this, because I've been working my fingers to the bone!\nPatrick: You just keep going on working and working!\nSpongeBob: \u200bYou never help!  Never!\nPatrick: There's that stupid noise again!\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's not a stupid noise. That's just Junior about to jump out of that two-story window.\nPatrick: Oh.\nBoth: Junior!\nSpongeBob: Did you catch him?\nPatrick: No.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're bad parents!\nSpongeBob: Junior? Hey, he's flying.\nPatrick: I guess he's all grown up.  Hey, what about Daddy?  That's my boy.\nSpongeBob: Goodbye.\nPatrick: Goodbye, Junior.\nSpongeBob: Well, Patrick, he doesn't need us anymore.\nPatrick: This is the hardest part of every parent's life, I assume.\nSpongeBob: Despite all we've been through, it was worth it.\nPatrick: Yeah... Let's have another.\n","50a\nWet Painters\nNarrator: A slow day at the Krusty Krab.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, check this out.  Two ordinary Krabby Patties, but when expertly tossed with the skill of a champ, they become...\nPatrick: A one-way ticket to pain!\nMr. Krabs: Huh?\nSpongeBob: Heave-ho!\nMr. Krabs: What the devil fish is going on out here?!  Time is money! And if you boys is wasting time, then you're wasting money!  And that's just sick!\nSpongeBob: But we were performing a ritual to attract customers. And the only way the ritual can work is for us to get hurt. Real bad.\nMr. Krabs: What stupid barnacle told you that?\nSquidward: Uhh\u2026\nMr. Krabs: Listen, instead of killing yourselves, I've got something real important for you to do for me.  Now, are you men ready for your Super...?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Super?\nMr. Krabs: Special...?\nBoth: Special?\nMr. Krabs: Secret...?\nBoth: Secret?\nMr. Krabs: Assignment?\nBoth: Assignment?!? / I beg of you, Mr. Krabs! / Put us out of our misery!\nMr. Krabs: The two of you are to paint the inside of me house!\nBoth: Yay!\nMr. Krabs: But, let me give you two a warning. This here paint is absolutely permanent.  It will never come off. So if I see even one drop on anything but wall, I'll have your rear ends cut off...  \u2026and mounted over me fireplace! So, have fun with the job.\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\nPatrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs sure has a lot of expensive treasures to drip paint on.  Do you think we should take this stuff off the walls?\nPatrick: No way, SpongeBob, we're not getting paid to move stuff.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, we're not getting paid at all.\nPatrick: Well that's what I said! We're not getting paid and that's final!\nSpongeBob: Okay, we'll just paint around all this stuff.\nPatrick: Good, just don't pay me.\nSpongeBob: First, we need to set up the tarp.\nPatrick: Tarp ahoy!\nSpongeBob: We're gonna need more coverage, Patrick.  Now that's what I'm talking about. Well, I guess we should open these cans of permanent paint now.\nPatrick: That will never ever come off.\nSpongeBob: And if we get it on anything, Mr. Krabs will cut our butts off.\nPatrick: And mount them on the wall.  Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, careful. Careful, SpongeBob. Careful, SpongeBob! Careful, SpongeBob!  Careful, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, the lid's already off.\nPatrick: Oh. Now it's my turn!\nSpongeBob: I'm thinking I should do this one, too, Patrick!\nPatrick: Well, that was a rip-off.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, let's get our brushes ready.  Uhh, maybe we should start with a smaller brush.  All right, Patrick, gotta get started painting this wall. With the permanent paint that we're not allowed to get on anything but the wall. Well, here we go.\nNarrator: One hour later...\nSpongeBob: Just a few more seconds of mental preparation and I'll be painting this wall.\nNarrator: Two hours later...\nSpongeBob: I'm getting to the painting.\nNarrator: Three hours later...\nPatrick: Can you move it along? I'm all out of time cards.\nSpongeBob: No problem. Here I go.  Yeah! Huh?!  Barnacles! What could be worse than a giant paint bubble?!\nPatrick: Oh, I know!  Two giant paint bubbles!\nSpongeBob: Noooooo!  Patrick?\nPatrick: Yeah, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I don't think this bubble can get much bigger!\nPatrick: Nonsense!\nSpongeBob: Pat, no!  We did it!  We painted the whole house and without getting a drop of paint on anything but the--  Flappin' Flotsam! What's that?!  We're dead, Patrick! Do you know what that is?\nPatrick: Hmm... it's a dollar. I win!\nSpongeBob: That's not just a dollar. It's Mr. Krabs' first dollar! His most prized possession! And we got paint on it!\nPatrick: I think you are over-reacting, SpongeBob, I don't see any paint.\nSpongeBob: Okay,  this isn't a problem. Maybe I can just wipe it off.  There! I think I got it.\nPatrick: Oh, now I see it!\nSpongeBob: This is not good, Patrick! This is not good! Mr. Krabs is gonna be home soon, and when he sees what we did to his first dollar\u2026\nPatrick: Wait, SpongeBob, all we got to do is wash the paint off and Krabs will never know!\nSpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said\u2026\nPatrick: Forget what Mr. Krabs said! Every paint comes off with something!\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\nPatrick: Nope.\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\nPatrick: Nope.\nSpongeBob: Did it work?\nPatrick: Nope.  Oof! Oof! Oof!\nSpongeBob: Nothing's working!\nPatrick: Wait, SpongeBob! We're not cavemen!  We have technology!\nSpongeBob: It didn't work.\nPatrick: This is all Mr. Krabs' fault! If he hadn't hung that stupid dollar in the first place...! I mean, it's not like it looks any different than a regular dollar. Why hang it? You could just stick any old dollar bill up on the wall, no one would even know the difference! You might as well reach in my wallet, pull out a dollar, and put it on the wall! And it would...\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, take out your wallet.\nPatrick: I don't see where you're going with this...  hey, a dollar!\nSpongeBob: Our butts are saved, Patrick! Now all we have to...Patrick, no!  No\u2026why'd you put it in the...  Grab it, Pat, grab it! Hurry, hurry!  Aww, Pat, no, no!  Get it, Pat, get it, get it, get it!  Oh, no-ho-oh!\nPatrick: Wanna bite?\nSpongeBob: Okay, okay, we still have time!  Don't panic, SpongeBob, panic is the enemy. You are strong. Through your strength, you shall overcome!\nSpongeBob's reflection: You're on your own, pal.\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, put Mr. Krabs' dollar back on the wall! I got an idea!\nMr. Krabs: What the\u2026?\nSpongeBob: We're all done, sir. Everything looks great.\nPatrick: Yeah, you don't have to look around. We already did that for you.\nMr. Krabs: You both look like you got a dirty little secret. Ha! I'm kidding. Let's see how you did. Oh, not bad boys, not bad. A nice even coat, high gloss, no bubbles.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, looks great, Mr. Krabs. We'll just be going...\nMr. Krabs: Flippin' fish fossils! Look what you did!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, we're so sorry! Don't de-butt me! Don't de-butt me!\nPatrick: Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Have mercy! Have mercy!\nMr. Krabs: Sorry? You dusted all my knickknacks! That was really nice. Great Barrier Reef! What's this?\nSpongeBob: It's not our fault, Mr Krabs!\nPatrick: We didn't do it on purpose!\nBoth: Accident! Accident! Accident! Accident!\nPatrick: I don't want to be butt-less!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, and I suppose the floor molding just painted itself on its own.  That's what I call craftsmanship. Criminy jim-jam! you messed up my dollar...  ...rama!  All the dolls in this dollarama were perfectly aligned!\nDoll: Mama.\nMr. Krabs: And you boys thought I wouldn't notice. Oh well, I guess no harm done. All right, boys, you're free to go.  Ow! That's funny, I don't remember a stack of painting jutting from the wall where me first dollar used to be. In fact, I don't remember this painting at all.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.  Or this one.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing?\nSpongeBob: Oh, you know, just hanging around.\nPatrick: Boo!\nMr. Krabs: Get down onto the floor, boy.  Alright, now you're just being silly.\nSpongeBob: No, No, Mr Krabs! No! Don't look, it's a trick!\nMr. Krabs: Did you two get paint all over me first dollar?!\nSpongeBob: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs!\nPatrick: We're so sorry!\nMr. Krabs: And then did you draw on it with crayon?!\nPatrick: I thought, you know, maybe he'd buy it.\nMr. Krabs: All right, boys... you know what I've gotta do now?!\nSpongeBob: You mean our butts?\nPatrick: Can I use mine one last time?\nMr. Krabs: There we go, good as new.\nBoth: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, I lied. This paint actually comes off with saliva!\nSpongeBob: Oh, I get it, Mr. Krabs. You told us the paint was permanent so me and Patrick would be more careful and not get paint on anything!\nMr. Krabs: Nah, I just like to mess with ya!  The old man's still got it!  Aww, crud. I really gotta learn to say it, not spray it.\n","50b\nKrusty Krab Training Video\nNarrator: Welcome aboard. If you're watching this video, then let me be the first to say: Congratulations!  You've recently been hired in the Krusty Krab  and this is your first official day of training.\nSpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now?\nNarrator: Oh no, you've got a lot to learn before you're ready to make a Krabby Patty. As you can see by this graph...  Graph!  You have been employed in one of the most successful restaurants in Bikini Bottom. But it didn't get that way over night...  ...because the store closes at 6:00.  No, the story of the Krusty Krab is the story of one man's hard work, perseverance, vision, determination and sweat.  But mostly his sweat.  From Humble Beginnings.  You may think that Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, owner and founder of Krusty Krab Inc., has always been the financial wizard he is today.  And you're right!  After the war, Krabs stayed secluded in a deep depression that seemed endless.  But then his luck changed when he acquired a bankrupt retirement home and with a few minor alterations, the Krusty Krab was born.  Sounds like a lot of...\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!\nNarrator: Sounds like a lot of...\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!\nNarrator: Sounds like a...\nHoopla fish: Hoopla!  Hoopla!\nNarrator: Sounds like a lot of hoopla to make over a little Krabby Patty, right?  Wrong!  The Krusty Krab today.  To keep up with today's demanding customers, no expense has been spared to acquire all the latest achievements in fast-food technology.\nMr. Krabs: This here's an advanced patty-control mechanism.  Here you can see our automated money-handling system. Don't touch!  These are high-quality beverage temperature devices. Imported.  This here's a prototype liquid transfer machine.  And most importantly,  You get your state-of-the-art condiment-dispersal units. Now, are you gonna buy something or just stand there cause there's a standing fee.\nNarrator: All of this modernization seems a little overwhelming, doesn't it?  Well luckily for you, Mr. Krabs fear of robot overlords keeps the balance of technology in check.  But if modernization is the heart of the Krusty Krab, then employees are the liver and gallbladder.  Let's see if you got what it takes. Hmmm, poised, confident, and a smile that says, \"Hello world! May I take your order?\" You've got the makings of a good employee, Mr. SquarePants! But for every good employee, there is one who is not so good.  Let's see, inattentive, impatient, a glazed look in the eyes.  Look carefully at the \"I Really Wish I Weren't Here Right Now!\" button. There's a name for employees like this, but we'll call him Squidward.\nSquidward: I'm getting paid overtime for this, right Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Sorry, can't hear you!\nNarrator: Training.\nSpongeBob: Does this mean I get to make a Krabby Patty now?\nNarrator: No, you can't make a Krabby Patty without understanding the phrase POOP.\nSpongeBob: POOP?\nNarrator: Once you understand POOP, you'll understand your place at the Krusty Krab. But what does POOP mean?  It's actually a carefully organized code. Watch closely. People Order Our Patties.\nSpongeBob: Ah, POOP!\nNarrator: Looks like Mr. SquarePants understands POOP.  Here's a typical customer. I wonder what he wants. Well, if we just remember POOP, we can figure it out.\nHarold: I'd like to order-\nNarrator: Do you think he's going to order: A: A sofa, B: An expensive haircut, or C: A patty?\nHarold: One patty please.\nNarrator: Ah, POOP! You never let us down!  Now that you understand POOP, I bet you think you're ready to make a Krabby Patty.\nSpongeBob: Krabby Patty!\nNarrator: Ha-ha! Not so fast, Eager McBeaver. We haven't even talked about: Personal Hygiene.  Every employee at the Krusty Krab must comply with a strict set of personal hygiene guidelines.  Okay, Mr. SquarePants, are you ready to prepare for your shift?  A good employee always washes himself thoroughly. Be sure to get under those fingernails.  And don't forget about the knuckles.  And make sure those palms are squeaky clean.  All right, let's see those hands.  Now that's thorough!  After making sure your boots are polished, your face is clear of any blemishes or boils,  and your hair is neat and tidy,  you are ready to start the day. Now let's see how Squidward prepares for his shift.  Remember, no employee wants to be a Squidward!  Now that you're clean and hygienic, I bet you think you're ready to make that Krabby Patty.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!  I'm ready!  I'm ready!\nNarrator: Whoa there! We have a few more topics to cover first.  Your Work Station.  It's important to keep your area tidy and free of droppings. But a clean workstation is only part of the job.  To make the vision in your head a reality, you'll need supplies. And a good employee always keeps his supplies well-organized.  Very nice, Mr. SquarePants, not a pickle out of place.  Now let's see how Squidward keeps his work station.\nSquidward: Huh?  Oh!\nNarrator: Don't worry, Squidward, Mr. SquarePants can cover for you.  Now that your workstation is up and running, perhaps you think you're ready to make the world-famous Krabby Patty.  Calm down.  There's plenty of time left. We have to make sure you're ready for the psychological aspect of the job: Interfacing with your Boss.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?\nMr. Krabs: No.\nNarrator: Good job, Mr. SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: Can I make a Krabby Patty now-\nNarrator: Now we go from behind the scenes to the front lines, where we'll examine the most important aspect of the industry, the customer. Or as we like to say, the \"Krustomer\"!\nPatrick: Who said that? Are you a ghost?\nNarrator: Like precious, precious blood in an animal, the customer is what makes the Krusty Krab strong and alive.\nPatrick: Squidward, your ceiling is talking to me!\nSquidward: Are you going to order something or just make friends with the paneling?\nPatrick: Uhh... I'll have an uhh... uhh... uhh... ah...  Huh? What's that?\nSquidward: Patrick, go be stupid somewhere else.\nNarrator: Ah-ah-ah, Squidward, remember what Mr. Krabs says.\nMr. Krabs: The money is always right!\nPatrick: The ceiling is right, Squidward. You're not a very good employee.\nSquidward: Fine. May I please take your order?\nPatrick: I'll have uhh... uhhhh...\nNarrator: We'll check up on these two later.  Right now, it's important that we discuss an emergency situation!  Like the lost gold of Atlantis, many consider the Krabby Patty to be a treasure. And as with every treasure, there's a thief ready to steal it. So it's up to you to be the watchful eyes of...  What's this?  It's Mr. Krabs business rival, Plankton!\nPlankton: Eat my microscopic dust, Krabs! Your secret formula is finally mine!\nNarrator: He's stealing the formula! What are you going to do, Mr. SquarePants?\nPlankton: You'll never catch me, Krabs! Not after I switch into maximum overdrive!  Hi-ya!  I knew I should've gotten the turbo.  Hear me, Krabs! You'll take this Krabby Patty from me when you pry it from my cold, dead...\nNarrator: And so, another emergency is avoided, thanks to Mr. SquarePants.  Let's check in on Squidward again. Psst, Squidward.\nSquidward: Huh?\nNarrator: Just remember POOP.\nSquidward: Patrick, if I could make a suggestion. Why don't you just order a Krabby Patty?\nPatrick: Great idea, Squidward! One Krabby Patty, please.\nSquidward: Will that be for here or to go?\nNarrator: Hang in there, Squidward, it's all part of the job.  Now that you've learned the basics of your training, it's time for the moment you've been waiting for.\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-daa, Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da-daa,\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-daa Da-da-da-la-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da-daa,\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa, tssshh Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-daa-da-da a-da-daa,\nTi-ta-ti-ti-ta-ti-ti-ta-ta-ta- la-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba- ba-ba-da-la-ba-ba-baa, Ti-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-taa,\nTi-ta-ti-li (gasps, then resumes)\nTi-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li- ta-ti-li-ta-ti-li-ti-ta-ti-ti- ta-ti-ti-taaaaa\nNarrator: Preparing the Krabby Patty!  At the center of every great dynasty is the crown jewel which keeps it alive and thriving.  For the Krusty Krab, this is the Krabby Patty.  And now you, the humble employee off the street, the all-too-necessary human resource that keeps this business afloat, will learn the sacred and dark secrets of how to prepare, with your very own hands...  the sumptuousness, lip-moistening, spine-tingling, heart-stopping pleasure center that is a Krabby Patty!

There'll be punch, cookies, explosions, and a brand-new episode of SpongeBob SquarePants!\nOld-time crowd: Hooray!\nNarrator: Now live, from Encino, California, get ready for a warm embrace from our party host, Patchy the Pirate!\nPatchy: Hey, get off my lawn! Party?  There ain't no party here. Go away!\nPotty: Bawk, come on in!\nPatchy: Hush, Potty, can't you see I'm trying to keep out the riffraff?\nPotty: Riffraff? That's our television audience, barnacle breath!\nPatchy: Oh, of course it is! I was just fooling! Welcome!  Say, you didn't bring SpongeBob with you, did you? I sure hope he got his invitation.\nSpongeBob: I'd sure like to go to this party, but I can't read the invitation!\nPatrick: Me neither.\nSpongeBob: Whoever sent this obviously has no idea about the physical limitations of life underwater! Well, might as well throw these in the fire.\nPatchy: Ah, well, come on in. Let me introduce you around. This here's Minnie Mermaid. She's cooling off on account of she's been dancing her scales off, isn't that right, Minnie, huh, takin' a little breakie poo?\nMinnie: No, Patchy. Actually, I'm in here because if I wasn't, I would die.\nPatchy: Ha, ha, that's the spirit!\nPatchy: Huh, let's see, who else haven't you met? That's Longbeard the pirate. Hey, there Longbeard, long time no see!\nNeptune: Who dares to interrupt Neptune?\nPatchy: Sorry about that, Neppy. That's Neptune.  He's king of the sea.  You kids having fun?  He-he.. whew! Hosting a party is hard work alright. That reminds me of a time when SpongeBob was hosting a party. Hey, you kids want to see that cartoon?  You do? Well then, launch the cartoon!\nNarrator: Ah, the Barg'n-Mart. A consumer's paradise of brand-like items, stocked as far as the eye can see.\nSpongeBob: Boom! 19 seconds! That's a new record, Lou!\nLou: Uh, that's great, SpongeBob. $1.42.\nSpongeBob: But it's not an official record until we record it in the Book of Records.  19 seconds.\nLou: Okay, so it's a $1.42.\nSpongeBob: Sign here please.  Initial here, and here, and here, and here.  Oh look, it's a picture I took of you the first time I ever came here!  Look at you, so young and happy!  Where do the years go? Hey, what's that? \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\"? Hey Lou, how much?\nLou: For the Plan Your Own Party kit? Oh, we're having a special on those. Uh, they're free. But you have to leave... right now.\nSpongeBob: Let's see Gary, according to the \"Plan Your Own Party Kit,\" invitations are the first order of business.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: \"A guest list consisting only your closest acquaintances will set an intimate tone for the evening and provide soiree success.\" Well, you heard the man, Gary, only our closest friends.\nFred's dad: Who the barnacle is SpongeBob SquarePants?\nMable: I believe you went to kindergarten with him, dear.\nFred's dad: Kindergarten, huh?  Oh yeah, SquarePants. Well, I guess it's time to move again.\nSpongeBob: Boy, Gary, this \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" is a real life-saver.  How else would I have known to make freshly-whipped clotted cream.  Gary, you better call an astronomer, because this clotted cream is outta' this world!  My pi\xf1ata!  Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.  The \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" suggests creativity when stuffing your pi\xf1ata, so I'm using deviled eggs.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Good question Gary, but not to worry. The \"Plan Your Own Party Kit\" warns that unsupervised parties can lead to disaster. That's why I've taken the liberty of devising a schedule!  8:00-8:05: Guests arrive. 8:05-8:15: Opening remarks and general discussion. 8:15-8:27: Craft corner, followed by name tag distribution.  At 8:27, we begin the qualifying rounds for our cracker-eating slash tongue-twister contest. 9:07: running charades.  9:38: charity apple-bob.  9:57: Electric jitterbug dance marathon, ladies' choice.  At 10:09, things start cooking as I dig into my world-famous knock-knock joke vault!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: And as long as we stick to this schedule, our party is a guaranteed success. This is gonna be the coolest party ever!\nPatchy: Ha, ha! Looks like it's smooth party sailing for SpongeBob so far. Now it's time for me to get my own party underway! Gather around, ye scurvy landlubbers, it's time to learn the peg legged dance o' happiness.  Oh, it's quite simple really, all you need is a peg leg and some patience. And my instructional video series, only $29.95.\nPotty: Bawk! How tacky.\nPatchy: It's a $40 value, Potty!  A $40 value! Now, it's very easy and loads of fun.\nSalt Water Sam: Hey, everybody, the band's here.\nPatchy: Band? What band?\nPotty: Bawk, the band I hired for the party.\nPatchy: A jolly idea, Potty. A little live musical get me shindig dug. Who'd you get?  Barnacle Bill and the Seven Seas?\nPotty: No.\nPatchy: Seaweed Sally and her Cackling Turtle?\nPotty: No.\nPatchy: Oh, oh, I know: The First Mates.\nPotty: No.\nPatchy: Saltwater Sam, featuring the Brine Brothers.\nPotty: No.\nPatchy: Uh, Rusty Hinges and the Boys from the Brig?\nPotty: They broke up years ago.\nPatchy: Well, who else is there?\nPotty: The Bird Brains!\nPatchy: Oh..\nPotty: The Bird Brains--They're better than all those other bands.\nPatchy: But they're just a bunch of birds.\nLead Singer: Hello, Encino!\nPatchy: Potty, that's the worst sea shanty I've ever heard! I certainly hope it doesn't get any louder. Ohh!  No, no, NO! Stop the music!  STOP! Look, boys, I know that you fellas sound good around the birdbath, but this here is basic cable! This is the big time! I'm afraid it's time for you to walk the plank.\nLead Singer: You mean we're fired?\nPatchy: No.  Go on, start jumping, or you'll be dealing with the business end of me sword! Ha, ha, ha...  No! I forgot that you're birds! Ahh!\nNarrator: While Patchy pulls himself together, let's see how SpongeBob's party is shaping up.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Gary, get ready. It's almost 8:00! Here they come!  Don't worry too much, Gary, it's only ten seconds past 8:00.  Now it's 20 seconds past 8:00! Maybe no one got their invitations. 30 seconds past 8:00! Oh, I'm doomed!  No one's coming. I'm the worst host ever!  Oh, the first guest, and only forty seconds late.\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Welcome, Patrick! May I compliment you on being fashionably late? Can I get you a glass of punch?\nPatrick: Sure?\nSpongeBob: Did you have any trouble finding the place?  Here you are!\nPatrick: Thanks.\nSpongeBob: So, the punch okay?\nPatrick: Not bad, not bad.\nSpongeBob: Hmmm, nice weather we're having.\nPatrick: It's been very mild, yes.\nSpongeBob: Yep, it's mild season.  Ahem. So, you read any...  Oh, more party guests!  Welcome, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Please let Gary take your coat, then allow me to offer you some hors d'oeuvres and a glass of punch.\nMr. Krabs: Don't mind if I do!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Two down, 175 to go. Oh, I almost forgot...  These name tags eliminate the need for awkward introductions.  Oh, more guests!\nPatrick: Kcirtap si eman ym o77eh. I don't get it.\nMr. Krabs: No, you dumb bunny, it says, \"Hello, my name is Patrick.\"\nPatrick: Nice to meet you Patrick.\nMr. Krabs: Good one, Patrick!\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: What's going on here? The laughter isn't scheduled until 9:03! You want to throw a party, do it at your house, Patrick.\nPatrick: Was he talking to me or you?\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you made it!\nSquidward: My cable's out.\nSpongeBob: Oh, uh, sorry to hear about that.\nMr Krabs: So, uh, how's it going, Squidward?\nSquidward: Not bad.\nSpongeBob: I have you making mild conversation with Mr. Krabs from 10:41 to 10:47.  But if you've got a case of the jabberjaws, I can hook you up with Scooter.  Here are some topic cards to break the ice.  Oh, someone's at the door!\nScooter: Mine says, 'What came first?: the oyster or the pearl?' You take the side of the pearl!\nSquidward: This is lame.\nUnnamed Character: My card says, \"Discuss the philosophical nature of irony.\" What does yours say?\nPatrick: \"Nod politely.\"\nMr. Krabs: What does yours say, Plankton?\nPlankton: Oh, uh, it says,  'Discuss the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty formula.'  How interesting.\nMr. Krabs: Nice try, Plankton.\nSpongeBob: Well, it's about time. Okay, everyone, the last guest is about to arrive...  22 minutes late!\nTom: Hey, hey!\nSpongeBob: Attention, everyone. Attention please! Now that we're all here, I officially declare the party switch to be in the 'on' position!  As soon as I get back from the coat room, we'll have a rundown of tonight's schedule. Try not to have too much fun without me!  Seriously.\nNarrator: (television version only) That includes you folks, SpongeBob's House Party will be right back after these messages.   Ahoy there! Welcome back to SpongeBob's House Party!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Gare, got another coat for you.  The party's going great, by the way. They're gonna be talking about this one for a long, long time. Well, back to  work.  Okay, everyone. Let's...huh? What's going on here?  This is all wrong! What's happening to my party?  No, no, no, no, no! Didn't you read the schedule? 10:00pm: Dance your pants off! 10:00pm!  Let's try to stick to the schedule, shall we? Cake will be eaten at 8:52, everyone! 8:52!  Hey, what's this?\nSandals: That's my breakfast!\nSpongeBob: Could I have everyone's attention please?  Patrick!  If everyone could take a seat on the couch please, while I sort this out. Thank you, thanks.  Hey everybody, thanks for your patience. I know we've gotten off to a rocky start here, so I'm going to get us back on track. It is now 8:37, and we all know what that means!  Time to read aloud from the newspaper comics! Okay, I think I'll start out with 'The Wisenheimers.' Okay, panel one: we see Roxy Wisenheimer with some sort of rake. Wait, I can't read from this!  This is yesterday's paper.  I'll just go grab today's paper.  SpongeBob, you sure know how to throw a party. What would they do without you?  Locked out?\nSandy: This song's got a great beat.\nPatrick: Yeah. Knock, knock.\nSpongeBob: Gee, I wonder why they don't hear me?  Oh no!  They're not using the topic cards! They're ad-libbing!  Now they're mad at Patrick! He's hogging the deviled eggs!  Look at those poor souls, they're so bored, they've gone mad! Oh, no. The party's falling into chaos without my hosting talents to guide it.\nPatrick: So, do you come here often?\nMrs. Puff: No.\nPatrick: Hello, SquarePants residence. What?  I'm sorry, what?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob!\nPatrick: You wanna talk to SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes... no, Patrick! I'm SpongeBob! I'm outside!\nPatrick: Okay, hold on.  SpongeBob, you out here? Phone's for you!\nSpongeBob: What? I-. No! Patrick! Wait!\nPatrick: Sorry, he's not out there.\nScooter: Hey, dude, if you're looking for SpongeBob, he's over by the punch bowl.\nPatrick: Thanks.  Here you go, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Phone in punch bowl? That's not even on the schedule!\nLarry: Larry, my man, you are looking good enough to eat!  Could use a little teeth whitener, though. I'm sure SpongeBob won't mind.  Hey, check out his crazy comb.\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, sounds like someone's rummaging through my medicine cabinet.  I hope they don't touch my special comb.\nLarry: Well, I think I've aired it up enough.  Hey, this party's finally starting to pick up.\nSpongeBob: I hope this doesn't interfere with finger puppet theater at 9:20! If I don't get back inside soon and restore order, there might not be enough time for the scheduled events!\nPearl: Gee, SpongeBob really knows how to throw a great party!\nMrs. Puff: Oh, yes, everything is quite lovely.  Eww, although I don't care for his taste of paintings.\nSpongeBob: I don't even know how that happened. Well, I have no choice. I'm gonna have to tunnel back in!  Okay, everybody, don't panic, the host has returned.  I can take losing the topic cards and the phone in the punch bowl, but...  ...I was supposed to lead the bunny hop! This is a bunch of barnacles! I'm breaking in!\nOfficer John: Well, well, well. What do we have here? A burglar bunny. Why do they do it, O'Malley?\nOfficer O'Malley: I don't know. It's probably how he gets his kicks.\nOfficer John: You criminals make me sick.\nSpongeBob: I'm no criminal! I live here! I'm...I'm throwing a party. I got locked out, I swear!\nOfficer John: Well, why didn't you say so? What a terrible misunderstanding!\nOfficer O'Malley: You have a nice party now, sir.\nSpongeBob: Boy, for a second there, I thought I was going to be arrested for breaking into my own house. What an ironic twist that would have been.\nOfficer John: Hey, wait a second, if you're throwing a party. Why weren't we invited?\nSpongeBob: But, I didn't know. Plan Your Own Party Kit didn't mention the police.\nOfficer O'Malley: Whoa, whoa, okay, motor-mouth, tell it to the judge.  Oh no, these cuffs are broken.\nOfficer John: Huh, we can't bring him in in broken cuffs. I got an old pair in the car we can use.\nSpongeBob: Is it too late to offer you some punch?\nOfficer O'Malley: Sir, you have the right to remain silent.\nSpongeBob: All night in the stony lonesome in a bunny outfit!  Oh, yeah, the door's locked.  Good thing I keep a spare key...under the mat. Grr!  Oh, look at this place! This party was a complete disaster.\nPatrick: That was the greatest party any of us have ever been to!\nSpongeBob: It was?\nPatrick: Oh, without a doubt, you are the best party-thrower ever!\nSpongeBob: I am?\nPatrick: Yeah! Whatever you did, you should write it down and do it again next weekend. Thanks again, SpongeBob. See ya!\nSpongeBob: SquarePants, you've done it again. I guess I know how to throw a party after all.  Gary! Well it looks like you had a good time.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Good night, Gary.\nPatchy: Oh ho ho, I'm glad to see that old SpongeBob's party worked out. Now I gotta get me own party going!

If there's anything, anything we can do to help you?\nCustomer: Well, there is one thing... as you can well imagine, my medical bills are extremely high, but luckily, I am able to keep myself alive by selling... chocolate bars.\nCustomer: Such nice boys,  it does my heart good to con a couple of Class A suckeroonies like those two! Ha ha ha!\nSpongeBob: Don't get me wrong, Patrick. It's great that we helped that guy out, but there's no one left in town to sell chocolate bars to.\nSpongeBob: Let's admit it, Patrick. We're failures.\nPatrick: I can live with that.\nSpongeBob: Let's change our names to Why and Bother.\nTom: Chocolate!\nSpongeBob: No! Don't hurt us. Please don't hurt me. No no. Please...\nPatrick: No! Have mercy on me! Please spare me!\nTom: Finally! I've been trying to catch you boys all day! Now that I got you right where I want you...  I'd like to buy all your chocolate.\nSpongeBob: Thank you for your patronage.\nPatrick: Are we living the fancy life yet, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Not yet, pally! First, we got to spend all the money.\nPatrick: But what are we going to spend it on?\nSquidward: Good evening, sir. Table for one, please.\nServer: Sorry, but the whole restaurant has been rented to a private party.\nSquidward: But it's my only night to be fancy! Oh, who could afford to rent out the whole restaurant?\nServer: Oh, a couple of rich entrepreneurs  and their dates.\nSpongeBob: So, how long have you two ladies known each other?\nMary's Mother: What? What did he say?\n","52b\nMermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V\nNarrator: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

I... Ohh... forget it, people. I say if you're not going to give me the respect I want as a hero, then maybe you'll give me respect as a villain. A villain who is... evil.\nSpongeBob: Evil?\nMr. Krabs, Squidward, Patrick, & Sandy: Evil?\nMermaid Man: Evil!\nBarnacle Man: I am crossing over... to the dark side!\nMr. Krabs: Why should I waste money lighting the whole store?\nDirty Bubble: Did someone say evil?\nSpongeBob: Holy oil spill!

Whoo hoo hoo!\nSpongeBob: Flopping flounder, Mermaid Man, Make-Out Reef!\nMermaid Man: Those fiends! Attacking hormonally stressed-out children!\nSquidward: Ah, Make-Out Reef. Good times, good times.\nMermaid Man: To Make-Out Reef,  away!\nPatrick: Does this mean we're not getting pizza?\nJohn & Nancy: Stop, please!\nE.V.I.L.: John and Nancy, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\nDirty Bubble: Oh!  Shine the flashlight in that car, Man Ray!\nMan Ray: Haha, with pleasure!\nSandals: Hey man, that's not cool.\nMermaid Man: Leave those young lovers alone!\nMan Ray: Well, if it isn't Milk Maid Man! You've saved us the trouble of tracking you down!\nMermaid Man: You fiends can't win! You're outnumbered!\nMan Ray: You senile bag of fish paste! There are three of us and only one of you!\nSpongeBob: Make that two!\nMan Ray: The Quickster!\nSquidward: Three!\nBarnacle Man: Captain Magma!\nPatrick: Four!\nDirty Bubble: The Elastic Waistband!\nSandy: Five!\nE.V.I.L.: M-M-Miss Appear!\nMermaid Man: And me makes ten, I think.\nMan Ray: Uh-oh.\nDirty Bubble: I don't have a good feeling about this.\nBarnacle Man: Oh, there goes our toy deal.\nMermaid Man: Super Acquaintances, attack!\nBarnacle Man: Oh no, please, mercy!\nSquidward: Krakatoa!\nSpongeBob: Ah! Ah! Ah! Get it off!  Get it off! Get it Off! Get it off! Get it off!\nPatrick: I'll save you, Quickster, ahh!\nMermaid Man: I'll cool you off, Quickster, with one of my water balls!  Aha!\nSquidward: Huh?! No, no, no, I'm not the Quickster! I'm Captain Mag...  ma...\nSandy: Well, I guess it's up to me!  I'll sneak over...unseen...and catch them by surprise.  Ahhhh!  Boom!\nSpongeBob: Get it off! Get it off!  Whew...I'm glad that's over!\nBarnacle Man: We did it, we won! This day belongs to E.V.I.L.!  You've lost Mermaid Man, and the superhero and super-villain rules say you have to give in to my demands.\nMermaid Man: Okay, what do you want?\nMan Ray: World domination! Tell him we want world domination!\nDirty Bubble: And make him eat dirt! Hahaha!  In addition to the...domination thing.\nBarnacle Man: Number one, I want to be treated like a superhero, not a sidekick. Number two, I want to be called Barnacle Man. And number three...\nMan Ray: Come on, world domination!\nBarnacle Man: I want an adult-sized Krabby Patty.\nDirty Bubble: Did you hear him say anything about eating dirt?\nBarnacle Man: Need a hand, superpal?\nMermaid Man: Good to have you back on the side of justice, Kyle. Let's go get you that Krabby Patty!\nMan Ray: Was that it? Oh, that's sickening.\nDirty Bubble: Oh, this reminds me of the time I went to Cancun with the killer shrimp. Oh, they had these papaya drinks...\nMan Ray: Oh, Neptune, shut up!\nMermaid Man: How is that adult-sized Krabby Patty treating you, Barnacle  Man?\nBarnacle Man: Actually, it's pretty big. I'm not sure if I can finish the whole thing.\n","53a\nNew Student Starfish\nSpongeBob: Time for Boating School! Let er rip, Gary.  Ahh...  Ta-da! Not bad, partner in crime. The toast could have been a little darker, though.  See you later.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, want to go jellyfishing?\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't. I have school today.\nPatrick: Well, what am I supposed to do all day while you're at school?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. What do you normally do while I'm gone?\nPatrick: Wait for you to get back.\nSpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick. Why don't you come to school with me?\nPatrick: Hey, that's a great idea!\nSpongeBob: You and me in school together as classmates! Think about it!\nPatrick: Wow.\nSpongeBob: Brace yourself, Patrick. I'm about to introduce you to the greatest academic thrill ride of your lifetime.\nPatrick: And no line.\nSpongeBob: Behold, Patrick, the Hallway Of Learning.  And this is the Fountain Of Learning.  And these are the Lockers Of Learning.\nPatrick: And these are the Stairs Of Learning, right?\nSpongeBob: No, they're just the stairs.  These are the Stairs Of Learning.\nPatrick: Where is everyone?\nSpongeBob: I don't know. Home, probably. Class doesn't start 'till 9:00.\nPatrick: 6:20? But I thought you said you were late.\nSpongeBob: Late for being early.\nPatrick: Hey!  When did I start wearing a watch?\nSpongeBob: And now, for the room with the most class: the Classroom.\nPatrick: Ohh.\nSpongeBob: And this is the chalkboard. It's the ladle that helps us drink from the Fountain Of Knowledge.\nPatrick: Ohhh.\nSpongeBob: And those drinks are recorded here on the Good Noodle board.\nPatrick: Huh? Uh, sorry. Ohhhh!\nSpongeBob: Attendance. Penmanship. Basic Desk Sanitation. Advanced Desk Sanitation. I'll add your name so you can start collecting good noodle stars, too.  There you are.\nPatrick: But look at all the stars you have. I'll never be that good.\nSpongeBob: Oh, now, Patrick. I'm just like everyone else, no matter how many stars I have. Ahem!  74.\nPatrick: Who said that?  Was it him?\nSpongeBob: I doubt it. That's Roger, our class science project.\nPatrick: What does he teach us?\nSpongeBob: The greatest lesson of all: the precious value of life. You see, Patrick, Roger's shell represents the fragile line between life and death when behind the wheel of a boat.  This light bulb represents knowledge. And without its energy and warmth, within minutes, Roger would die.\nPatrick: Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death! Life! Death!\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\nPatrick: Sorry.\nSpongeBob: The best part about being early is you get to sit close to the teacher. Think you can handle the second chair?\nPatrick: I'm learning!\nSpongeBob: This is gonna be great!\nMrs. Puff: Hello, class, my name is Mrs. Puff. And the only reason I say that I see we have a new student. Young man, why don't you stand up and introduce yourself?\nPatrick: Who's the fat kid talking to?\nSpongeBob: You, Patrick, she's the teacher.\nPatrick: Oh.\nMrs. Puff: Come on now, tell the class your name. Don't be nervous.\nPatrick: Uh...uh...\nMrs. Puff: We just want to know your name.\nPatrick: Uh...uh...uh!...24!\nMrs. Puff: Oh, great, another genius...\nPatrick: Why are they laughing?\nSpongeBob: I guess it's just in the timing.\nPatrick: Oh.\nMrs. Puff: Today's first lesson will be on turning.\nPatrick: 24.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.\nPatrick: What?\nSpongeBob: I thought of something funnier than 24.\nPatrick: Let me hear it.\nSpongeBob: 25.\nMrs. Puff: That's enough! Young man, this is your first day, so I'll let you off with a warning. As for you, SpongeBob, I expect more from a good noodle. Pay attention.\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff.\nMrs. Puff: Now then, \"Turning\"; what every driver should know. When you are turning, it is important to signal at least...\nSpongeBob: Big Fat Meanie? Patrick, you can't do that! She's the teacher!\nMrs. Puff: What about the teacher?  As if I really look like this!  SpongeBob, I believe you know the punishment for two classroom disruptions.\nSpongeBob: No...\nMrs. Puff: I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but if one wishes to be a good noodle, one must behave like a good noodle.\nSpongeBob: I'm a good noodle! I'm a good noodle!\nMrs. Puff: You'll get this star back when you earn it...\nSpongeBob: No!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\nPatrick: Mrs. Puff, is it naptime?\nMrs. Puff: SpongeBob, I've had enough of your nonsense. Now collect your things and move to the available desk in the back of the room!\nSpongeBob: What, me? But why?\nMrs. Puff: Because the Big Fat Meanie said so. Now go!\nSpongeBob: Thanks a lot, Patrick.\nPatrick: Sure thing, buddy.\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can be a Good Noodle from back here.  It's so hard to hear. What kind of student sits back here anyway?  'Skool is 4 Chumps'? Where am I?\nPatrick: Psst, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Just ignore him, SpongeBob.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, over here.\nSpongeBob: Whatever you do, don't look at him.\nPatrick: Psst, SpongeBob.  Psst, SpongeBob.  SpongeBob?  SpongeBob? Psst, over here. I'm trying to tell you something. Something important.\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: Hi.\nSpongeBob: HI?!\nMrs. Puff: Perhaps this would be a good time for recess.\nPatrick: Hey, buddy. Funny stuff in there, funny stuff.\nSpongeBob: There is nothing funny about what you did in there, Patrick! You got me in trouble! You got me moved to the back of the room! You cost me one of my Good Noodle Stars!\nPatrick: Who cares about a stupid star?\nSpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, it seems like you would care a lot about stupid stars, considering you are one!\nPatrick: I'll deal with you after class!\nSpongeBob: It is after class!\nPatrick: I don't see anyone fighting, do you?\nSpongeBob: They're talking about us! We're fighting!\nPatrick: Well, don't mind if I do!\nStudent: This is embarrassing.\nMrs. Puff: What's going on here?!  Well?\nPatrick: SpongeBob and I were fighting.\nMrs. Puff: Fighting?  Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, but, SpongeBob SquarePants, I hereby sentence you and your friend  to detention!\nSpongeBob: Detention!?\nMrs. Puff: May Neptune have mercy on your souls.\nSpongeBob: In one day, I've gone from Good Noodle to Bad Egg.  It's all Stupid Patrick's fault.  I hate you, Patrick.\nPatrick: I hate you more.\nSpongeBob: I'd hate you no matter what.\nPatrick: Yeah, well, I'd hate you even if I didn't hate you.\nSpongeBob: I'd hate you even if that made sense.\nPatrick: I'd hate you even if you were me. That's how much I hate you.\nSpongeBob: I'd hate you, even if, uhh...  Um, I'd hate you...  even if the light bulb keeping Roger alive went out.  Huh?\nPatrick: Ohh...  Hmph.\nPatrick: Ohhhhh...!\nSpongeBob: Mmmm... I'm sorry I called you a stupid star!\nPatrick: I'm sorry I got you in trouble and got you moved to the back of the class and got your Good Noodle Star removed and shot the spitballs...\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry your apology is so long!\nPatrick: Me too! Let's save Roger!\nSpongeBob: I'll keep him warm and you get a light bulb from the supply closet.\nPatrick: Ahh. Light bulb!  But why does it have to be so far away?  I'm coming, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Oh, where's Patrick? Aw, forget it. I've got to go find Roger some warmth.  The light bulb! Without its warmth, Roger will die!\nPatrick: Roger! Without him, the light bulb will have nothing to warm!\nSpongeBob: We did it, Patrick! We saved Roger's life!\nMrs. Puff: Good job boys!  I saw the whole thing from behind my one-way chalkboard, and I couldn't be happier with your teamwork. I've decided to give you each one gold star. Although I'm not sure what saving an egg has to do with Boating School.\nPatrick: Boating School? I thought this was Spanish class. See ya SpongeBob. See ya Big Fat Meanie.\nRoger: Hey what'd I miss?\n","53b\nClams\nSandals: Uhh, what do you like better? The coral bits or the nacho oyster skins?\nSquidward: I like neither. Can I take your order?\nSandals: What about the barnacle rings, are they any good?\nSquidward: No. What will you have?\nSandals: Well, uhh, what's your vote on the kelp?\nSquidward: Sir, let's just get this out of the way, I hate everything on the menu! Now, what do you want?\nSpongeBob: Psst, try the coral bits.\nSandals: Uhh, I'll try the coral bits.\nSquidward: That'll be one dollar.\nSandals: What's going on?\nSquidward: Something stupid, I'm sure.\nMr. Krabs: Yippee!  Whoo-ha! Whoo-ha!\nSquidward: See? I told you.\nSpongeBob: What's wrong with Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Nothing, lad! Do you know what this is?!\nSquidward: A very dirty dollar?\nMr. Krabs: No! This is my one millionth dollar earned. Every Krab's goal in life is to make a million dollars, and now I got mine. Congratulations, sir. You have just given me my one millionth dollar.\nSandals: Ha, great. Uhh, what do I win?\nMr. Krabs: Nothing. Now get out.\nSandals: Uhh, what?\nMr. Krabs: Get out! Everybody get out, you're spoiling me moment!  Me millionth dollar.\nSpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Congratulate yourselves, lad. A captain's nothing without his loyal crew. I mean, a crew like you  comes around maybe once in a lifetime. And to reward you for making me millionth dollar, I'm taking you on a trip.\nSpongeBob: Wow, a trip!\nSquidward: I can't believe it, Mr. Krabs. Where we going, Fancy Springs?\nMr. Krabs: No.\nSquidward: Pamper Island?\nMr. Krabs: Try again.\nSquidward: Ooh, ooh, ooh, Bikini Bottom Folk Village?\nMr. Krabs: Better than that!\nSquidward: Clam fishing? This is the reward we get for all our hard work?  Fishing for stinky clams in a smelly old boat on a filthy lagoon? You call this fun?\nMr. Krabs: Aww, come on now, Squidward. Three fellas at sea with nothing to do but throw their lines in the water, catch a few clams  then throw them back. Don't you think that's fun?\nSquidward: No.  And to think I could be wearing a powdered wig right now.\nSpongeBob: Hey Squidward, you want me to cast out over here so you can watch me?\nSquidward: How about you cast out over there so I can ignore you?\nSpongeBob: Okay.\nSquidward: Hey, watch where you're swinging that...  SpongeBob, be careful with... ow!  Okay, I've had enough.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, you got to lighten up.  Sure the lad's a bit overeager, but you've got to learn to roll with the punches, go with the flow. And don't bring anything on a boat that you ain't prepared to lose.  Me millionth dollar!  SpongeBob, wait! SpongeBob, you hooked me millionth dollar on the back swing! Reel it in before I keelhaul ya.  Oh no. SpongeBob, quick, reel it in. Can't you hear the music? That's a 4/4 string ostinato in D minor! Every sailor knows that means death! Reel it in before it's too late! Hurry, SpongeBob! The music's getting faster!  There you are, ya stinkin' bilge rats! Stop playing that music! Stop it, please! I'm begging ya! Come on, honey, you can make it! Swim faster! Come to me, baby! Come on back! Hurry, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Here she comes...She made it!\nMr. Krabs: For a second or two, I thought she was a goner.\nSquidward: So, some trip, eh, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward! You're never gonna believe it! A giant blue-lipped clam ate me millionth dollar!  I lost me dollar, and I'll never get it back!  Never, never, never, never, never!\nSpongeBob: I've never seen Mr. Krabs so broken up.\nSquidward: Oh, puh-lease, he's such a drama queen. C'mon, Mr. Krabs, drop the act.  Mr. Krabs, it's just a stupid dollar.  For Pete's sake, Mr. Krabs, suck it up!  Mr. Krabs...  Mr. Krabs...  Okay, okay, Mr. Krabs, we'll help you get your dollar back!\nMr. Krabs: You will? Great! Wait right here.  Here's where clam fishing gets serious.  Okay, you boys man the fishing poles and I'll keep me eyes peeled for Old Blue Lip.\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, captain!\nMr. Krabs: And remember, we don't leave until we catch that clam and rescue me dollar.\nSquidward: That's it, I'm finished! We've been here for three days and haven't gotten a nibble! This is hopeless!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, and I've gotta get home to feed Gary.\nSquidward: We're gonna die out here just because a clam ate Mr. Krabs' stupid dollar!  Well, if he wants his dollar back, I say we give it to him. Know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh?\nSpongeBob: Oh, I get ya.\nSpongeBob & Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs!  Look what we've got!\nMr. Krabs: Could it be?  Me millionth dollar?  Whoo-hoo!  Wait a minute...  This isn't me millionth dollar.  This is an ordinary dollar that's been crumpled up, torn slightly, soaked in the lagoon, and kissed with Coral Blue #2 Semi-Gloss Lipstick.\nSpongeBob: Actually, it's Coral Blue number-  three.\nMr. Krabs: I trusted you, and you gave me this? I can't believe me own crew would betray me like this.\nSquidward: No. Uh-uh. No, we will not be swayed by tears anymore.\nMr. Krabs: I see. Then I guess I have no choice but to offer a reward.\nSquidward: You're kidding?\nSpongeBob: Woo! Is it another fishing trip?\nMr. Krabs: No. It's this sandwich.\nSquidward: A sandwich? You expect me to break my back over a sandwich?\nMr. Krabs: Not a sandwich.  The sandwich.\nSquidward: Whatever. We've got plenty more to...  ...eat.\nMr. Krabs: Now, I think we understand each other. Nobody eats until I get my millionth dollar back.\nSquidward: Uhh, SpongeBob, can I have a word with you? Have you noticed that Mr. Krabs has gone COMPLETELY INSANE?!\nSpongeBob: What do you mean?\nSquidward: Just look at him.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, he's lost something near and dear to him. Haven't you\u2014\nSquidward: Look again.\nSpongeBob: You're right. How do we get out of here?\nSquidward: If we're real quiet, we can sneak over to the lifeboat.\nSpongeBob: Okay.\nMr. Krabs: So, you thought you'd skip out on old Krabs, did ya? Even after you promised to help me. I know what you're thinking. \"It's just a dumb old dollar. Let's just leave the old man, he won't notice.\"  Well, it's not going down like that. There's only one use for a backstabbing crew like you: live bait!\nSquidward: You're crazy! If that clam didn't come before, what makes you think he'll come now?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, he'll come.\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, listen, I work with SpongeBob all day long, so I know what I'm talking about when I say...  you are completely out of your mind!  Get us out of here!\nMr. Krabs: Come on, fresh meat!  Keep thrashing! He likes it!  Come on, boy! Closer. Closer. Almost there.  That's it!  Aha! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Look, boys, I finally got it!  I finally got me millionth dollar.\nSpongeBob: Oh, poor Mr. Krabs. Gone forever out of our lives...  Why couldn't it have been me?!\nSquidward: Yes, why couldn't it have been you?!\nSpongeBob: Why did he have to go like this?! Why?\nSquidward: Why did he have to go like this and leave me tied to this idiot?!\nMr. Krabs: Hello, boys.\nSpongeBob & Squidward: Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Have you boys met...  ...me millionth dollar?\nSpongeBob: Wow, how did you get it back?\nMr. Krabs: It wasn't easy. Old Blue Lips is quite the fighter. So, eventually, we settled on a trade.\nSpongeBob: What did you give him?\nMr. Krabs: Nothing important.\n","54\nUgh\nNarrator: It's time for another SpongeBob SquarePants special! But it's not an ordinary special,  because today we go to Encino, California, as it was\u2026  \u2026100 million years ago! So prepare yourself for\u2026  SpongeBob SquarePants B.C.!  Before Comedy.  With your host, Patchy the Pirate!\nPatchy: Yee-ha! Hey kids! Now, you're probably wondering, \"Hmm, what's Patchy doing in a cave?\" Good question, you little\u2026  Well, it's because today's SpongeBob takes place in prehistoric times  \u2026back when man struggled for survival  and dinosaurs ruled the Earth.  Isn't that right, Bronty? But I'm riding you now.  It's stuck.  Like I was saying, prehistoric times were the greatest.  It was a simpler time  with simpler pleasures.  Your clothes always match.  You can draw on the walls. And nobody yell at ya.  It was much easier to hit a baseball.  Oh yeah, prehistoric times were the best.  Hey kids. Are those pterodactyl wings I hear 'a flappin'? I think I know who that is. Please welcome the Potty-dactyl\nPotty: Sorry I'm late.\nPatchy: Potty! Why aren't you wearing your costume?  I stayed up all night making it!\nPotty: You're wasting your time, old man. Prehistoric stuff is lame. Everybody knows the future's where it's at.\nPatchy: What?!  That's not true. Don't mind him, folks. Why even SpongeBob SquarePants knows that prehistoric stuff is, what the kids say,  cool.\nPotty: No, he doesn't.\nPatchy: Yes, he does.\nPotty: Nope.\nPatchy: He most certainly does.\nPotty: No, he doesn't.\nPatchy: Yes, he does!\nPotty: No.\nPatchy: I know for a fact that he does!\nPotty: \u2026not.\nNarrator: Meanwhile...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob. What's wrong?\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Mr. Krabs, but I've got this strangest feeling that somewhere a pirate and parrot are arguing about me.  And the parrot is winning.\nPatchy: Does.\nPotty: Doesn't.\nPatchy: Does.\nPotty: Doesn't.\nPatchy: Does.\nPotty: Doesn't.\nPatchy: Does! Uh, look, while we're arguing, why don't you folks go ahead and watch some prehistoric SpongeBob? Roll the cartoon! \u2026does.\nPotty: Doesn't.\nNarrator: Ah, dawn breaks over the primordial sea.  It's here that millions of years ago, life began taking its first clumsy steps out of the darkness, opening its newly- formed eyeballs to stare into the blinding light of intelligence, in order to- Umm... never mind. This happened a long time ago.\nSpongeGar: Banooga ready! Tabonga, Gary.\nPrehistoric Gary: Meow.\nSpongeGar: Gary! Tabonga!\nGary: Meow.\nSquog: Huh?

It looks like our prehistoric pals have just discovered fire, but they will soon learn that when you play with fire, you may get burned. Stay tuned.\nPatchy: I told you prehistoric times were fun! Hey! How's about I teach you kids how a caveman makes a fire with  two sticks?  Yeah\u2026 Doesn't get any cooler than that, huh? Chalk one up for Patchy!  Rubbing\u2026  I guess this is a type of wood that doesn't burn.  Potty!\nPotty: Laser technology. Score one for the future.\nPatchy: Well, I have something that you'll never find in your little  future: a real live caveman. Hmm\u2026  Hey, there he is! Come on in, little troglodyte fella. Come on\u2026  You see, kids, I found him frozen in a block of ice and then I spent three days thawing him out with my mom's hair dryer. I call him Cavey.  Isn't he something? It's okay, Cavey.\nPotty: That's nothing, old timer. Make way for the future.\nRobot: Greetings. I am the X-29488. How may I serve you?\nPatchy: Where do you keep getting all this stuff?\nPotty: Never you mind, pops. Let's go see what Cavey thinks.\nRobot: Attack! Attack!\nPatchy: Potty! You're ruining me caveman show!\nRobot: Attack! Attack!\nNarrator: Will Patchy ever get control of the special?  What will SpongeBob do with fire?  Stay tuned to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. and find out!\nNarrator: Welcome back to SpongeBob SquarePants B.C. Sounds like things have gone from bad to worse for Patchy. Let's watch.\nPotty: This is great.\nPatchy: Ahoy, glad you're back.  Let's watch the rest of SpongeBob B.C. while I get things straightened out around here. Whoa!  Or\u2026 maybe not.\nNarrator: When we last saw our hungry troglodytes, they just discovered fire. How long will it take for them to mess it up? Let's see.\nSquog: Bolapa.\nSquog: Ganoga, Patar.

All I wanted was to show the nice people how great the cavemen were. But all they got was technology-induced chaos!\nPotty: Come back inside. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.\nPatchy: You got rid of the robot android cyborg?!\nPotty: Nope, even better.\nPatchy: Potty, I guess I really misjudged you\u2026  What the-?!\nSong: \"When Worlds Collide\"\nWhen worlds collide\nPotty: Pretty sweet, eh?

A new loincloth?\nPotty: No.\nPatchy: An enlarged forehead?\nPotty: No.\nPatchy: Aww, what is it?  Potty!\nPotty: This is great.\nPatchy: Well, thanks for watching SpongeBob B.C., kids.  Bye!  Now he's tickling!  Cut it out, you rascal!\n","55a\nThe Great Snail Race\nSpongeBob: Good morning, pineapple!  Good morning, Gary!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Good morning, world! I'm ready! World?\nSquidward: Talk to me.\nDelivery Man: Package, sir.\nSquidward: A-ha!  I can't believe it's finally here!\nDelivery Man: Here ya go!\nSquidward: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.\nDelivery Man: Thank you, Mr... mmm... \"Tennisballs.\"\nSquidward: That's Tentacles!\nSpongeBob: Squidward's last name is Tentacles?\nPatrick: Poor guy.  Hey, check out Squidward's new snail.\nSpongeBob: Fancy. So that's what came in the mail. Looks like Gary has a new little playmate.\nSquidward: Pfft, dream on, SpongeBob.  I wouldn't let Snellie here play with that mongrel mutt. She's a purebred.\nPatrick: Wow, a snail made out of bread.\nSquidward: No! Purebred means she is of the highest pedigree. See?  She even has her own papers. So if you'll excuse us, Snellie has to start her training.\nSpongeBob: Training?\nSquidward: For Bikini Bottom's snail race. Snellie will be winning this Sunday.\nPatrick: Sunday?\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess I can't enter Gary in that. Sunday's laundry day!\nSquidward: No, SpongeBob. You can't enter Gary because Gary's a mutt.\nSpongeBob: Boy, you got that right. Gary's no...  hey! What makes you so sure Gary couldn't win that race?\nSquidward: Papers.\nPatrick: Hmmm. 'Property of Squidward... Tentpoles.'\nSquidward: That's Tennisballs... de-derr, Tentacles! Come on, Snellie.\nSpongeBob: You know what? I'm starting to get the idea that Squidward thinks his snail is better than mine.\nPatrick: No!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\nPatrick: Yeah, I should get a snail and enter it in that race and beat Squidward!\nSpongeBob: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  No, no, no! I'm thinking about entering you in that race and beating Squidward's snail!  Looks like we're going to start our training now, ladies!  I call you a lady to humiliate and demean you. It's a motivational tool we coaches use.\nSandy: Hmm... I don't know why, but I think I'll kick SpongeBob's butt tomorrow.\nSpongeBob: Kelp powder for muscle mass.  Raw eggs, 'cause they're clich\xe9.  And nails for toughness.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Of course, I expect you to eat this.  It's scientifically designed to help you win tomorrow. Gary?  Wow, pretty good time.\nPatrick: Hey SpongeBob, check out my new snail.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, your snail is a rock.\nPatrick: Yeah, thanks, I know. He's got nerves of steel. See you at the big race.\nSpongeBob: Boy, the competition's getting tough.  That's it, Gary.  We are going to start some serious training right now.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Alright Gary, let's start with some sprints.  On your mark. Get set. Go! Go Gary, go! Come on, go, Gary! It's all yours, Gary!  Gary?  Come on Gary, the big race is tomorrow. You got to start training if you want to win.\nSquidward: Don't waste your breath, SpongeBob. That mongrel of yours doesn't have a chance against Snellie.\nPatrick: Excuse me, but you two seem to be forgetting who the real winner will be... my snail.\nSquidward: Patrick, that's a rock.\nPatrick: Yeah, thanks. I know. He's got nerves of steel.\nSquidward: What are you standing on, anyway?  Like I said, don't even bother showing up tomorrow.\nPatrick: My snail's really got Squidward scared, huh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Sorry Patrick, Gary and I have got some serious work to do.\nPatrick: You can run, but you can't hide, SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: Alright Gary, no more fooling around. Time to get serious.  Come on, Gary, move it!  Up, up, up, up! Down, down, down, down!  Faster, faster, faster! Go, go, go!  Come on, push it, Gary, push it!  Move that shell!  Come on, Gary, move it!  Let's go, let's go, let's go! Faster!  Let's go, let's go! Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up! Move it, Gary! Move it, move it, move it, move it...  Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.  Come on, Gary, we're gonna be late for the big race!\nNat: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our live coverage of this year's annual spring classic, the 102nd Running of the Snail. And what a beautiful day for this sport of kings, of which I am a huge fan. Seriously, I'm just a fan. I was on my way to my seat, the door was open.\nPerch Perkins: Hey, what are you doing?!  Heh, sorry about that, folks. Let's go down to the field to join the mayor for the pre-game ceremony.\nMayor: And now, for the lighting of the Torch of Good Sportsmanship, please join me in welcoming snail racing's first-ever champion, Lightning Larry Luciano!\nPerch Perkins: Would you look at that, folks? Lightning Larry Luciano, a living legend, slowly making his way center stage. And what a proud moment for this sport. The crowd is going absolutely nuts...  ...for Larry.  He's almost there. Uhh, yes, any minute now.\nNarrator: Two hours later...\nPerch Perkins: He's almost a quarter of the way there.\nMayor: The torch is lit! Let the race begin.\nSquidward: Well, SpongeBob, I must admit, I didn't think that mongrel mutt of yours would even find the starting line. Congratulations.\nSpongeBob: Save it for the Loser Circle, Squidward. Gary happens to be in the best shape for the rest of his life.\nSquidward: I'll alert the paramedics.\nPatrick: Good one, Squidward.\nOfficial: You guys ready?\nPatrick: A burglar!\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, that's the official.\nOfficial: We're ready to start here, folks.\nSquidward: Okay, Snellie, let's show these common, garden-variety snails what superior breeding is all about.\nSnellie: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Alright, Gary, listen up, the competition is going to be fierce. You're the undersnail. Everybody's already counting you out. Now get out there and win, so we can rub Squidward's big fat nose in it.\nGary: Meow.\nPatrick: This is what you've been training for, Rocky. This is why we're here.\nOfficial: On your mark. Get set.  Slither!\nPerch Perkins: And they're off! Number six, Snellie, rockets out of the starting blocks, leaving the other two competitors in the dust!\nSpongeBob: What!\nSquidward: Go, Snellie, you got it, baby!\nSpongeBob: What are you doing, Gary?! The race has started! You let Snellie take the lead! Let's go, Gary. Start moving! You're blowing everything we trained for! Blowing it!\nPatrick: It's okay, Rocky. You go when you feel like it.\nSpongeBob: Gary, are you listening to me?! Get the anchors out of your pants right now!  Don't give me that look! I said now, mister! Get going, Gary!  Go, go, go, go, go!\nPerch Perkins: And there goes number 7 out of the starting gate. Oh, hang on, folks. He doesn't look so good.\nSpongeBob: Not good enough, Gary, not good enough! Faster!\nPerch Perkins: I do not like the look of this.\nSpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's a race! A race! Have you heard of 'em?!\nPerch Perkins: That coach is pushing that snail too hard!\nSpongeBob: Faster, Gary, faster, faster, faster, faster!  Huh?\nPerch Perkins: Oh, looks like number 7 has a blowout!  Oops, make that two, folks.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Gary?\nPerch Perkins: Plus, a blown head gasket! Oh, and the poor creature's still going for it.\nSpongeBob: Umm, Gary, you can stop now!\nPerch Perkins: He's losing control!\nSpongeBob: You can take a break now if you want to, Gary.\nPerch Perkins: He's spinning out of control!  He's heading straight for the wall!\nSpongeBob: No!  Hold on, Gary, I'm coming!\nPerch Perkins: Whoa. One of the coaches seems to have raced onto the track. That is an automatic disqualification. Looks like number six has this race all wrapped up, ladies and gentlemen.\nSquidward: Come on, Snellie, it's all you, baby!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I'm sorry! Why didn't you just say I was pushing it too hard?!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: You did?  Oh, Gary, why didn't you tell me I wasn't listening?!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: You did?  Oh, Gary! Oh, Gary!\nSnellie: Meow.\nSquidward: What?!\nSpongeBob: Gary?  Oh!\nCrowd: Aww!\nPerch Perkins: My, oh, my. Folks, I have never seen anything quite like this. It seems Snellie, the leader, just went back to comfort Gary.\nSpongeBob: Looks like you and I are in-laws, eh, Squidward?\nSquidward: But that's impossible. If Snellie didn't win, then...\nAnnouncer: And the winner is Rocky!\nSquidward: I can't believe it. My purebred, which cost me $1,700, lost to a rock.\nPatrick: Don't worry, Squidward, I know how much you wanted to win, so I had the trophy engraved to you.\nSquidward: Gosh, Patrick, thanks.  The 1st Place Snail Racing Cup Presented to Squidward...  ...Tortellini?! Will I ever win?\nSandy: That's for yesterday, SquarePants!\n","55b\nMid-Life Crustacean\nRadio DJ: You've got it tuned to K-O-L-D, K-Old, your all-oldies station.

Pearl, do you think I'm... old?\nPearl: Well, of course I do! But that's okay. Daddies are supposed to be old.\nMr. Krabs: But I'm still cool, right? Your old man is cool?\nPearl: See, no one says cool anymore. That's such an old-person thing. Now we say \"coral,\" as in, \"That nose job is so coral.\"\nMr. Krabs: Coral, eh?\nPearl: Eww, when you say it, it sounds so uncoral.\nMr. Krabs: Well, what if I said it with a different inflection?

The happiest time of the day!\nSpongeBob: Closing time.  The saddest time of the day!  Huh?  It's a Krabby Patty.  Eww... It's cold and hard.  This could have rolled under there years ago.  There, there, little one, your journey is almost over.\nMr. Krabs: What happened?  Someone tried to throw away a patty!\nPinch-o-matic: Pinch-o-matic has saved you 5.2 cents.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I found that under the grill.\nMr. Krabs: And tomorrow, a customer will find it under his bun.\nSpongeBob: But it's old and cold. And so very full of mold.\nMr. Krabs: You're not to make another Patty until that one is sold. Understand?\nNarrator: The next day...\nSpongeBob: Order up, Squidward.\nSquidward: Hooray.  Uh... SpongeBob, can I get one with less... fog?\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' orders.\nSquidward: Whatever.  Here you are, sir. One Krabby Patty.\nMr. Krabs: I don't understand! We haven't had a customer in weeks! I wonder if it's the new placemats?\nSquidward: What?  Placemats?! Have you lost your mind? It's that old Patty you keep trying to sell to everybody! It's gone bad.\nMr. Krabs: Gone bad? That's nonsense! Bring it here, SpongeBob.  Uh, why is it in a cage?\nSpongeBob: Because it growled at me.\nMr. Krabs: You two would have never have lasted in the navy. Let's see how bad you are.  No... no...  Stay...  Thatta girl! There, there.  See? Good enough to eat.  Oh, look, an ambulance. Now, then...  SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Make sure you wrap up that Patty. I'm not finished with it yet!\nPurple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. Krabs, you gave us quite the scare.\nMr. Krabs: So I'm gonna be okay, doc?\nPurple Doctorfish: Well, if you don't want to take my word for it, let's just check your chart.

Excuse me, nurse?\nNurse: Yes?\nFlying Dutchman: I'm looking for Eugene Krabs.\nNurse: Oh, he's in that room right there.\nFlying Dutchman: No, that's Harold Flower's room.\nNurse: Harold Flower?\nFlying Dutchman: So, Krabs, you thought you could fool the Flying Dutchman?\nMr. Krabs: What do you want from me?\nFlying Dutchman: I'm here to escort you to the resting place of all bad undersea folk: Davy Jones' locker!\nMr. Krabs: Davy Jones' locker?! Why do I have to go there? I'm not a bad crab!\nFlying Dutchman: Ah, but you were cheap, and being cheap is a terrible thing. Next stop, Davy Jones' locker!  Here we are.\nMr. Krabs: Blec! Why does it smell so foul?\nFlying Dutchman: Davy Jones works out a lot.  These are his socks. Get in!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, please, Mr. Dutchman, I don't wanna go in there! I'll do anything! Please, give me another chance!\nFlying Dutchman: Come on, Krabs, show a little dignity.\nMr. Krabs: Mommy!\nFlying Dutchman: Alright, alright, stop your crying. I'll give you another chance, but you must always be generous, never cheap.\nMr. Krabs: You have me word as a sailor.\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs' nose hair clippers. I could use these.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you shouldn't be going through Mr. Krabs' belongings.  He won't like it!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I told you what the doctor said. Mr. Krabs isn't coming back.  Now, keep quiet so I can hear the tumblers in his safe.\nMr. Krabs: Hey, boys!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I knew it! You're alive!  Squidward, look, it's Mr. Krabs! Isn't this too good to be true?\nSquidward: Well, it was.\nMr. Krabs: You know, boys, being sick made me do a lot of thinking. My whole life has been about money. Saving money, collecting money,  touching money...  Well, you get the picture. But no more. You're looking at the new, improved, non-cheap Mr. Krabs.  Welcome all, welcome!  Hello, little one. What you got there?\nTimmy: A Krabby Patty.\nMr. Krabs: Of course, you do! You know what that means, right?\nTimmy: I don't go hungry?\nMr. Krabs: No, silly! It means free toy!\nTimmy: Gee, thanks Mr. Krabs. I thought you were a cheap, old tightwad.\nMr. Krabs: I was, son, I was. Free toys for everyone! And free refills!  Hello, boy! Say, where's Squidward?\nSpongeBob: Oh, he's taking one of those break things in your office, I mean, the 'employee lounge'.\nMr. Krabs: Great!\nMartha: Excuse me, but I dropped my Krabby Patty. Could I get another one?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes sir.  Krusty Krab policy clearly states that once the burger has reached the customer, it is his/her responsibility...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  That's the old policy. Now run back and bring out a fresh one.\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir.\nMr. Krabs: Sorry about the confusion.  Free toy?\nSquidward: Eugene, my man.\nMr. Krabs: Squidward! How's the break coming?\nSquidward: Should be over in a couple of hours. Have SpongeBob send back a patty and an iced-tea, will you?\nMr. Krabs: Sure thing, Squidward. Take it easy.  Are you enjoying your in-meal movie?\nHarold: This movie hasn't even been in the theaters yet!\nMr. Krabs: No expense spared for my valued customers.  Look at all those happy faces. It sure does feel good to be generous.\nSquidward: Here's your mail, Eugene.\nMr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward. You look rested.\nSquidward: Yeah, these naps at work are doing wonders for me.\nMr. Krabs: Credit card bills. Well, I knew this was coming. Let's see what the damage is.  Only ten thousand dollars. That's not so bad.  I'll just subtract it from today's profit.  And... there's no money in here.  How delightful.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, I'm worried about Mr. Krabs.\nSquidward: Me, too. How are we gonna get paid?  Gee, Mr. Krabs, you sure are taking total bankruptcy well.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, it's just a bad dream. I'll wake up soon.\nSquidward: Uh... \"dream\"?\nMr. Krabs: Sure. I'm still in the hospital sleeping like a baby!Uh\nSpongeBob: Umm, you checked out of the hospital this morning.\nSquidward: Here's the bill.\nMr. Krabs: You mean... I'm awake?  No more refills!  Give me back them toys, you freeloaders!  Show's over, cheapskate!\nNathiel Waters: Hey, it's my lucky day, a penny!\nMr. Krabs: Your luck just ran out!\nNathiel Waters: Hey man, ease back, you're crushing my arm.\nMr. Krabs: Unhand that penny, or the arm comes off.\nFlying Dutchman: A-ha! That little display of parsimonious penny pinching just earned you a nice little spot in Davy Jones' locker... For eternity!\nMr. Krabs: I'm not cheap, I'm generous!\nSquidward: You almost tore a man's arm off for a penny.\nMr. Krabs: Thanks, Squidward, I knew I could count on you.  Well, a deal's a deal. Let's go.\nSpongeBob: Wait just a burger-flipping second!\nFlying Dutchman: Who dares back-sass the Flying Dutchman?\nSpongeBob: That would be me: SpongeBob Back-SassPants. I say you got the wrong crab. This Mr. Krabs is the most generous, big-hearted, non-skinflinted crab in the whole sea.\nFlying Dutchman: He'd sell your soul for a couple of bucks.\nSpongeBob: I'd bet my soul he wouldn't.\nFlying Dutchman: You got yourself a bet. Okay, Krabs, I'll let you stay, but first, help me settle a bet. If you had to choose between SpongeBob and all the money I have in my pocket, which would you take?\nMr. Krabs: That depends, how much money we talking about?\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nFlying Dutchman: 62 cents.\nMr. Krabs: I'll take the money.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nFlying Dutchman: Here you go, Krabs. Sixty-two cents.  Next stop: Davy Jones' locker!\nMr. Krabs: Look, Squidward, money!\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how could you trade SpongeBob for sixty-two cents?\nMr. Krabs: You think I could've gotten more?\nSquidward: He stuck up for you and you sold him out. You should be ashamed of yourself!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, what have I done?  I want another chance! I didn't learn anything! I lost me best fry cook! I don't want this foul money!  I want SpongeBob back!\nFlying Dutchman: Here, take him back.\nMr. Krabs: You heard what I said about the money?\nFlying Dutchman: Heard what you said? I couldn't hear myself thinking with this one around. I only had him for thirty seconds.  And it's jellyfishing this and Mermaid Man that. Why, not giving him back is a fate worse than death!\nSpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy merchandise were the closest thing to everything. I love jellyfishing, you should love jellyfishing. You should come some time and bring your own net!\nFlying Dutchman: He's your problem now.\nMr. Krabs: Heh, about trading you for pocket change...\nSpongeBob: Say no more, Mr. Krabs. You did it for the Krusty Krab. I would have done the same thing.\nMr. Krabs: You would have?\nSpongeBob: No.\nFlying Dutchman: Dutchman's residence.\nSpongeBob: So, as I was saying, you and me gotta hang out more. What nights are good for you? Here are the nights that are good for me: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I gotta work.  I work at the Krusty Krab. My best friend is Patrick. He's pink.\n","56b\nI Had an Accident\nPatrick: Aww, I got dead again. This game stinks.\nSandy: See, that's why you must always pay attention to the mountain.\nSpongeBob: I'm listening to you, mountain!  Don't eat the yellow sand, Patrick.\nPatrick: Oh, yeah, I forgot.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, watch me do the \"Grouchy Squidward\".\nSquidward: Stop naming moves after me!\nSpongeBob: Everybody's an idiot except for me.\nSquidward: Well, it's true.\nSandy: SpongeBob! Look out for that tree!\nSpongeBob: Huh?  Don't worry, guys, everything is under control, \u2018cause I'm an...  Expert...!  Huh, that's funny. Someone turned the mountain upside down!\nSandy: SpongeBob! Land on your bottom! It'll cushion the impact of the fall!\nSpongeBob: Like this?\nPatrick: No, your other bottom!\nSandy: Don't you have to be stupid somewhere else?\nPatrick: Not until 4.\nSandy: Ooh, that's gotta hurt.\nPatrick: Do it again! I wasn't looking!\nDoctor: Well, it looks like your gluteus maximus has made a full recovery.\nSpongeBob: My what has a what now?\nDoctor: Your butt's all better. It's really quite amazing.  It took twenty hours to put it all back together.  We actually ran out of staples and had to use a glue stick . Yep, you're a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, luck boy. But from now on, I'd like you to be more careful. One more injury like that and you could wind up like that poor creature there.   In the Iron Butt.\nTom: Aww, man. It itches.\nSpongeBob: You heard the doctor, SpongeBob. One more injury like that, then it's the Iron Butt. I've been too careless back there. From now on, I am on around the clock butt patrol.  Hep, hep, hep! Stay away from the backside! I'm warning you!\nHarold: What's your problem?\nSpongeBob: Whew. That was close.\nFootball Player: Hey, SpongeBob, why don't you join us? We need an extra player.  Nice catch, Percy!\nJimmy: Hey, SpongeBob!  You've gotta try this, dude! We finally got enough people for a seven-mile spanking machine!  Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch! Ha, ouch.\nMartin: Next.\nSpongeBob: No.\nSquidward: Is this where the line starts?\nSpongeBob: My butt is not safe out here!  No part of me is safe!\nSandy: Yeah. Ride 'em, cowboy!  Hey, SpongeBob!\nPatrick: That was fun.\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob, you ready to go sandboarding again? SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Hello, friends. Enjoying the outside world?\nSandy: Whatcha all doing sitting in the middle of the floor like that?\nSpongeBob: Oh, living out the remainder of my life, in safety. If you guys were smart, you would join me. That accident made me realize that it's dangerous out there. I was one of the lucky ones. I'm a survivor. And so I simply decided that I'm never leaving my house again.\nSandy: That's crazy talk!\nPatrick: That's not crazy talk. This is crazy talk.  Sorry.\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick's right, Sandy. You saw what happened and next time it won't just be my butt, it'll be my armpit or my forehead.\nPatrick: Or your other armpit!\nSpongeBob: I was wrong to go against nature. I'm a sponge. What was I thinking? Walking\u2026 My people are sedentary.\nSandy: Just sitting in your house? Ain't you gonna get lonesome?\nSpongeBob: I won't be lonesome. I've got all the friends I need right here. This is Penny...  and Chip...  and say hello to Used Napkin.\nSandy: Well, how are you gonna keep your job at the Krusty Krab?\nSpongeBob: No problem!  A really long spatula.\nSandy: What about eating?\nSpongeBob: I'm a sponge! I'll just filter-feed.\nSandy: SpongeBob, sooner or later, you're gonna have to go outside!\nSpongeBob: Listen, I've told you, but I'm never leaving my house again.\nPatrick: Never ever?\nSpongeBob: Never ever ever!\nPatrick: Never ever ever ever ever for never ever?!\nSpongeBob: Never ever never never ever ever never!!\nPatrick: Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever?!\nSpongeBob: Never ever...\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Never never never never ever never ever never\u2026\nSpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, that is enough! Chip, will you mind showing these two to the door?\nPatrick: Thank you, Chip.  I guess I'll to have to find a new best friend. Hey, Squidward!\nSquidward: No!\nPatrick: Aww!\nSandy: Don't worry, Patrick, we'll get SpongeBob to come outside, and then he'll see there's nothing to be afraid of.\nPatrick: And that's when I  punch him, right?\nSandy: Look at all the jellyfish out here. Too bad SpongeBob's missing out on all the fun.\nPatrick: I caught one!  Huh?\nSpongeBob: Look at those fools. Risking their lives, jellyfishing. My new hobby is much more safer, isn't it, Chip? Dust collecting.  I think I caught one!\nSandy: We've got to try something else!\nSandy and Patrick: \u266aThree cheers on your birthday, SpongeBob! Three cheers for you!\u266a\nSandy: Now you got to blow out the candles and make a wish.\nSpongeBob: I don't need the wish, Penny. Everything I could ever want is right here. In fact, let's sing our own song about the joy of staying indoors. \u266aI know of a place where you never get harmed. A magical place with magical charms. Indoors! Indoors! Indoors!\u266a Take it away, Penny!\nPatrick: That penny has the most beautiful voice.\nSandy: That is it, SquarePants! We're gonna find you something that's so dang fun that you'll have to come outside!\nSandy: Trampoline!\nPatrick: Ice cream.\nSandy: Underwater surfing!\nPatrick: Two ice creams.\nSandy: Ferris wheel!\nPatrick: Still two ice creams.\nSandy: Clam wrestling!\nPatrick: Washing an old person.\nSandy: Patrick, that's not fun.\nOld man: It is for me!\nSandy: Nothing's working, Patrick!\nPatrick: What do we do?\nOld man: I say we take a bath!\nSandy: Wha...will you get out of here?\nSandy: Now remember. Don't jump out until I give the signal.\nPatrick: Right.\nSandy: All right, SpongeBob. You win. Stay inside forever. Yours is truly the iron will. Now, Pat!  Eek! A gorilla! Save me, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Okay, guys, really. This is your saddest attempt yet. Even Chip knows that's Patrick in the same costume that he wore for Halloween last year.\nSandy: No, really! You've got to come and save me!\nPatrick #2: Hey, Sandy,  who's your friend?\nSandy: But you're supposed to be in the gorilla suit.\nPatrick #1: I am in the gorilla suit.  I thought I was doing a pretty good job.\nSandy: If you're Patrick, then who's that?  Ah! A real gorilla!\nSpongeBob: ' Huh?!  Oh, my gosh!  This can't be happening!  This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about!  Well, they were asking for it. It's not like I didn't warn them about the dangers of outside. Yes, Chip, I know they're my two dearest friends in the world, but I told them, I wasn't going outside no matter what. We can do without the name calling, thank you very much, Used Napkin! I know, Chip. If I was out there, bagged by an ape, Patrick and Sandy would risk anything to save me. And I've got to do the same for them. If I don't come back alive, Chip, take good care of Gary.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Well, here we go. From the safety of my home, to the outside world.  I'm taking my  first step.  So far, so good. I think I can do this!  Oh, dear Neptune, get off of me, get off of me! Chip! Help me, help me!  I'm still alive! I did it! I made it outside! Nothing can stop me now!  Is it too late to go back inside again?\n1st half of SpongeBob: It's too late.  Patrick? Sandy?\nPatrick and Sandy: Yes, SpongeBob?\n1st half of SpongeBob: I'm sorry I caused all this. I'm not scared of going outside anymore. But I'm terrified of gorillas now.\nSandy: Ah, that's okay, SpongeBob. Us too.\nFirst half of SpongeBob: You know what I don't understand though?\nSecond half of SpongeBob: What?\nFirst half of SpongeBob: What's the gorilla doing underwater in the first place?\nGorilla: Oh! Well, it's funny you should, uh, you see, George, they're on to us!\nGeorge: Let's get outta here!\n","57a\nKrabby Land\nSpongeBob: Ah, I don't know how you do it, Gare Bear, but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Well, time to punch that clock. But not before checking my motivational Quote-a-Day calendar.  You are a winner.  And today's the first day of summer!  Happy first day of summer, Squidward!  Care to join me for solstice caroling?  Walking in the grass, it's so fine, don't need shoes in the summertime!\nSquidward: I'm not much of a summer person, SpongeBob.\nMr. Krabs: Davy Jones on the jib! Do my ears deceive me? Is it really the first day of summer? Is it?\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\nMr. Krabs: Whee-hoo!\nSpongeBob: Gee, Mr. K., you sure have a scorching case of summer fever!  What is it about summertime that makes us so happy? The firefly-lit nights, the intoxicating aroma of a charcoal briquette, the hypnotic sound of a lawnmower running over a flip-flop?\nMr. Krabs: The money!\nSpongeBob: The money?\nMr. Krabs: Er, uh... I mean, uh... the children!\nSpongeBob: Oh.\nMr. Krabs: You see, boy, during the summer, the children are excused from their classes, a recess commonly referred to as summer break.\nSpongeBob: Tell me more about summer break.\nMr. Krabs: Well, during this summer break, the children wander Bikini Bottom unsupervised, their pockets lined with allowance.  Free to spend their money without any parental guidance whatsoever.  I guess that's what I like best.  Sure, I suppose some would try and take advantage of this situation by selling them toys or candy, but I sleep well at night with the knowledge that I'm providing them with something they need: a nutritious meal.  Come here, you little piggies!\nSpongeBob: I've been taught the true meaning of summer.\nNarrator: Later...\nSpongeBob: Almost closing time, Mr. K.\nMr. Krabs: What? But that's impossible.  What about the money? I mean uh... uh... what about the children?  I guess summer isn't coming this year.\nSpongeBob: Hey, maybe they're all at that new playground over there.\nMr. Krabs: Playground? Luring away me young customers. Warm up the boat, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: See anything, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, they're here, all right. Just look at them, SpongeBob.  So weak and malnourished.  With nobody trying to sell 'em nothing.  Breaks me heart.  No! I've got nothing to live for, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: The way you drove the boat while lying on the ground was kind of cool.\nMr. Krabs: True. But that's not gonna get these munchkins away from this playground. Unless... hmmm... see you tomorrow, boy. Got a lot of work to do.\nSpongeBob: You got it, Mr. Krabs... hey!  Another day, another dollar. Gee, I wonder what Mr. Krabs has been up to since I saw him last and then went home to do nothing of particular interest 'til this very moment.  Huh?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  You're just in time for the grand unveiling of Krabby Land!\nSpongeBob: Krabby Land, sir?\nMr. Krabs: Yes, Krabby Land!  Where a kid can have fun... for the right price.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, young man. What's your name?\nMonroe: Monroe.\nMr. Krabs: Nice to meet you, Monroe.\nMonroe: Whee!\nMr. Krabs: Mmm... a-ha!  Okay, money. I mean, err... children. It's time for the grand unveiling of... money! I mean, Krabby Land!  Okay, kids, now promise Uncle Krabs that if you get hungry while you're playing, you'll come inside for some delicious, nutritious Krabby Patties.\nKids: We promise.\nMr. Krabs: All right, here we go! I give you... Krabby Land!\nKids: Yeah!\nTyler: Whoa! Ooh, where am I?\nMr. Krabs: Eh... that reminds me. I forgot to give you these coloring books/liability waivers!  Everyone who hands theirs back gets to meet the one and only Krabby the Clown!\nKids: Yay!\nMr. Krabs: Have fun and don't forget to eat plenty of vitamin-enriched Krabby Patties.  Krabby the Clown's favorite meal.\nKids: We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby! We want Krabby!\nSpongeBob: Where is Krabby, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: He'll be here after I count their money. Just stall 'em.\nSpongeBob: Stall 'em? How do I do that?\nMr. Krabs: I don't know. Be entertaining.\nSpongeBob: Hey, kids!\nMonroe: You're not Krabby the Clown.\nSpongeBob: No, I'm not. I'm, uh...  I'm Krabby's beloved sidekick, the Krabby Patty..Umm... Burglar!\nTyler: Lame.\nSpongeBob: Krabby will be here soon. He, uh, had to take the bus. But in the meantime, let's have some fun! You kids like bubbles?\nMonroe: No.\nSpongeBob: Well, you've never seen my bubbles.  Voila! A bubble shaped like a jellyfish. How 'bout that?\nTyler: Still lame.\nSpongeBob: Okay, prepare to be blown back on your tailfins.  Ta-da!  Uh... huh.\nKids: You stink! Bring on the clown!\nSpongeBob: Okay, uh... and now for a finale!  Oops.\nKids: Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!\nSpongeBob: My eyes!  Whoa!   They seem to respond to me being in pain. They enjoy other people's misery.  Hey, kids, check this out.\nKids: Woo-hoo!\nSpongeBob: I got 'em right where I want 'em.\nKids: Woo-hoo! Yeah!\nKids: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!  Yeah, woo!  Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha!\nSpongeBob: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\nKids: Yay!  Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Ugh. Mr. Krabs? I can't take any more of this stalling stuff.\nMr. Krabs: Always thinking about yourself. Get out there and stall! What happened to your arms and legs, boy?\nSpongeBob: The kids are using them as... boomerangs.\nMr. Krabs: Boomerangs? Oh no! They might break my windows!\nSpongeBob: What are we gonna do?\nMr. Krabs: Well, now that all their money's counted, tell them Krabby has just arrived!\nSpongeBob: Really? He's here?  Oh, boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!\nMr. Krabs: Get out there and tell 'em!\nSpongeBob: Listen, everybody. Krabby the Clown is in the building!\nKids: Yay!\nSpongeBob: Who do you want?\nKids: Krabby!\nSpongeBob: When do you want him?\nKids: Now! Krabby, Krabby, Krabby!  Krabby! Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: Hey, kids! Are you ready to meet Krabby the Clown?\nKids and SpongeBob: Yay!\nMr. Krabs: All right, here you go!  Hey, kids! Uh, thank you all for coming! Thank you. Eat plenty of Krabby Patties!  Ah, Krabs, you've done it again!\nSpongeBob: I'll say you have.\nMr. Krabs SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: How could you, Mr. Krabs? You promised these children Krabby the Clown, but all I saw out there was... Cheapy the Cheapskate!\nMr. Krabs: Hey, I ain't cheap!  Now take this tomato back to the kitchen before it spoils.\nSpongeBob: But what about the true meaning of summer? What about the children?\nMr. Krabs: The children? I don't care about the children!  I just care about their parents' money. Ah, the fact that their feeble minds are easily manipulated by cheap playgrounds and talentless clowns is no skin off my nose!  Survival of the fittest, SpongeBob! Survival of the fittest.\nKid: Ahem.\nMr. Krabs: Huh?  Oh, hey kids.  Uh... Uncle Krabs has to go to the bank now. Heh.\nMonroe: Get him!\nSpongeBob: I suppose I'll never know the true meaning of summer. I thought I knew it once, but that was a long, long time ago.\nSquidward: You mean this morning?\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\nMonroe: Come on outside, Mr. SquarePants. It's a summer miracle!\nKids: Yay! Hooray!\nSpongeBob: Wow, thousands of dollars fluttering in the breeze. I guess that's the true meaning of summer.\nKids: Hooray!\nSpongeBob: Where's Mr. Krabs? He's missing out on all the summer fun.\nMr. Krabs: Let me go! I gotta get some of that green stuff!  No! Not that green stuff!  Noooooooooo!\n","57b\nThe Camping Episode\nSquidward: Ahh, finally, the weekend is here. And this isn't just any old weekend.  This is the weekend that SpongeBob and Patrick go camping. Wouldn't it be great if they got lost in the woods and never came back?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I'm scared!\nSquidward: Ho-ho, that would be great!  You've waited a long time for this! A soft bed, warm tea, a good book, and two whole days with no...   What the...?  SpongeBob! Aren't you two supposed to be camping?\nSpongeBob: We are camping.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, it's not camping if you're ten feet from your house.\nSpongeBob: Aww, it doesn't matter where you are as long as you're outdoors. While all those soft city folk are safe in their beds reading books, we're out here, pitting ourselves against the formidable forces of nature. You wanna join us?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside.\nSquidward: What do you mean, \"have fun inside\"?\nSpongeBob: Just... have fun inside! See you tomorrow.\nSquidward: Oh. Bye.  You little sneak! I see what you're doing!\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: Don't think I can't see what you're doing!\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: You're saying I can't take it!\nSpongeBob: But all I...\nSquidward: Aah. You're saying I'm soft! You think your little \"have fun inside\" challenge is gonna make me come camping with you, but that is never gonna happen! There's no way I'm gonna sit out here all night with you two losers! So, get used to it!\nSpongeBob: Okay. Have fun inside!\nSquidward: That's it! I'm in! I'll show you camping!\nSpongeBob: Squidward's gonna come camping with us!\nSquidward: Now you'll see how a real... ugh!  ...outdoorsman does it!  Here we are, my remote-controlled, self-assembling tent. Watch and learn.\nSpongeBob: That was great, Squidward, but how do you get inside?\nPatrick: Yeah, it's all crushy-looking.\nSquidward: It isn't put up yet, you idiots!\nSpongeBob: Customization!\nPatrick: Genius!\nSpongeBob: He's tenderizing the ground!\nPatrick: Of course!\nSpongeBob: Write that down, write that down!\nSquidward: Huh? Voila!  But what could compare to just lying out under the stars?  Well, I've worked up an appetite as big as all outdoors. Time for a little grub. I suppose you two are gonna stew up some twigs and rocks, right?\nSpongeBob: Nope, we've got something even better! Marshmallows.  Mmm... just like the astronauts eat.\nPatrick: Patrick to SpongeBob. Patrick to SpongeBob. Do you read me? Over.\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Patrick. I read you. Over.\nPatrick: Patrick to SpongeBob. I like going . Over.\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Patrick.  Me too.  SpongeBob to Patrick. Help yourself. Over.\nPatrick: Yummy!  Patrick to SpongeBob. The deliciousness has landed!\nSquidward: Well, you two astronauts can eat marshmallows, but I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls , just as soon as I can get my can opener.\nSpongeBob: But Squidward, didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?\nSquidward: Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.\nSpongeBob: But this is the wilderness! It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.\nPatrick: Pretty weenie!\nSquidward: All right, all right, gimme a marshmallow.\nSquidward: Okay. Besides spitting molten food stuffs at me, what else do you do for fun?\nSpongeBob: Well, after a long day of camping, it's nice to unwind with a nice, relaxing campfire song. I call this one \"The Campfire Song Song\". \u266aLet's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song. Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song. And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong. But it'll help if you just sing along...\u266a\nPatrick: \u266aBum! Bum! Bum!\u266a\nBoth: \u266aC-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aAnd if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong! But it'll help if you just sing along...\u266a\nPatrick: \u266aSing another song...\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aC-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song!\u266a Patrick!\nPatrick: \u266aSONG! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E...\u266a\nSpongeBob: Squidward!  Good! \u266aIt'll help... it'll help... if you just sing along!\u266a  \u266aOh yeah!\u266a Ahh, now, wasn't that relaxing?\nSquidward: No! This is relaxing.\nSpongeBob: Oh no! I'll save you, Squidward!  Squidward, are you all right? That's it, chew, chew, and swallow. There, better?\nSquidward: Better?! I was just fine until you lodged that ballistic junk food into my windpipe!\nSpongeBob: But I had to! It's too dangerous to play the clarinet badly out here in the wilderness! It might attract... a sea bear.\nSquidward: A sea bear? You mean like the ones that...  don't exist?!\nSpongeBob: What are you saying?\nSquidward: There's no such thing! They're just a myth.\nSpongeBob: Oh no, Squidward, sea bears are all too real. It says so in the Bikini Bottom Inquirer.\nSquidward: \"I Married a Sea Bear\"?\nPatrick: Yeah! And Fake Science Monthly!\nSquidward: \"Sea Bears and Fairy Tales Are Real\"? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\nPatrick: Well, maybe it is stupid, but it's also dumb!\nSpongeBob: Patrick's right, Squidward. Sea bears are no laughing matter. Why, once I met this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy's cousin...\nSquidward: You're right! I should be more careful. In fact, why don't you tell me all of the things I shouldn't do if I want to keep the sea bears away?\nSpongeBob: Okay, that's easy. First off, don't play the clarinet.\nSquidward: Okay. Then what?\nSpongeBob: Never wave your flashlight back and forth really fast.\nPatrick: Flashlights are their natural prey.\nSquidward: You're kidding.\nSpongeBob: Don't stomp around. They take that as a challenge.\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSquidward: Go on.\nSpongeBob: Don't ever eat cheese.\nSquidward: Sliced or cubed?\nSpongeBob: Cubed. Sliced is fine.\nSquidward: Yeah, yeah, and?\nSpongeBob: Never wear a sombrero...\nPatrick: ...in a goofy fashion!\nSpongeBob: Or clown shoes.\nPatrick: Or a hoop skirt.\nSpongeBob: And never...\nPatrick: Ever...\nSpongeBob: Ever...\nPatrick: Duh!\nBoth: ...screech like a chimpanzee!\nSquidward: Wow! That's amazing how many things can set a sea bear off!\nBoth: They're horrible!\nSquidward: And... and suddenly I have the sense we're all in danger.\nBoth: Why?\nSquidward: I don't know...  Just a feeling!\nSpongeBob: No.\nSquidward: Yes.\nSpongeBob: No.\nBoth: Squidward, please don't!\nPatrick: SpongeBob, what are we gonna do? A sea bear's sure to come and eat us!\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Patrick. I'll draw us an anti-sea-bear circle in the dirt.\nPatrick: Good thinking! All the experts say it's the only defense against a sea bear attack.\nSquidward: You guys are so gullible. See? I did everything that attracts a sea bear, and nothing happened. If sea bears really exist, why didn't one show up?\nSpongeBob: Maybe it's because you're not wearing your sombrero in a goofy fashion.\nSquidward: Oh, pfft. Sorry, how silly of me! You mean like this?\nSpongeBob: No. Like that.\nthe screaming Squidward while SpongeBob and Patrick are still huddled inside their anti-sea-bear circle\nSpongeBob: Squidward, are you okay?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: Quick! Jump inside our anti-sea-bear circle before he comes back!\nPatrick: Yeah. Sea bears often attack more than once.\nSquidward: Are you crazy? A dirt circle won't stop that monster. I'm running for my life!\nBoth: No!\nSpongeBob: Don't run! Sea bears hate that!\nSquidward: Thanks for the tip. I guess I'll just limp home, then.\nBoth: No!\nSpongeBob: They hate limping more than running!\nSquidward: Well, I guess I'll just have...\nSpongeBob: I should have warned you about crawling.\nSquidward: What'd I do that time?\nSpongeBob: I don't know! I guess he just doesn't like you.\nPatrick: Pretend to be somebody else!\nSpongeBob: Here, draw a circle.\nSquidward: Okay.\nSpongeBob: That was an oval. It has to be a circle!\nSquidward: Move over!  Hey, it worked! You guys saved my life!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I'm glad it was just a sea bear. This circle would never hold back a sea rhinoceros!\nSquidward: What attracts them?\nPatrick: The sound of a sea bear attack.\nSpongeBob: Heh. Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea-rhinoceros undergarments, heh heh. Right, Squidward?\nSquidward: Huh?\n","58a\nMissing Identity\nTed: Oh, no, I lost my pen.\nWaitress: You can borrow mine.\nTed: Thanks.\nSpongeBob: I lost something once. I lost something I couldn't live without-- my identity.\nTed: So, anyway, thanks for the pen.\nWaitress: No problem, hon.\nSpongeBob: It all started last week-- Monday morning to be exact-- the day I lost my identity.\nTed: I've gotta go.\nSpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  Awk! Gary, help! I can't see. Gary!  Gary, are you there?  Ow!  Gary? Gary, buddy? I need you to be my eyes, okay? Am I near the bathroom?  Gary? Gary?  Gare?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Gary. Now that my horrific incident of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way-- pop!  Enjoy, buddy. Hmm, you know, I've been feeding this to Gary for years, and I don't even know what it tastes like.  Bleah!  Bleah!  Bleah!\nSadie: What is it, Peterson?\nPeterson: I'm not sure. I feel... a disturbance.\nSpongeBob: That was the worst thing I've ever tasted. Oh well, at least I'll never have to do it again.  Barnacles! All these shenanigans made me late for work.  Uh oh.  All right!\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hi Patrick! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!\nWaitress: Wait a minute. When exactly did you lose your identity?\nTed: Yeah, and who's Patrick?\nDiner Chef: And why did you eat Snail-Po?\nSpongeBob: Ah, ah, ah, patience, good people. A great story can't be rushed. However, I will skip ahead to the Krusty Krab.  Order up!  One Krabby Patty grilled with the fiery warmth of my beating heart. Enjoy.\nCustomer: Thanks, uh...  Oh.\nSpongeBob: Is there a problem?\nCustomer: Well, you really should be wearing a name tag so I can thank you properly.\nSpongeBob: While it is against my philosophy to disagree with the customer, I must point out that I am in fact wearing a name tag, right here.  Huh?\nSquidward: Uh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, it's terrible! It's the most terrible thing that's ever happened to me. I lost my name tag. Pourquoi!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, take it easy! I'm sure you can get a new one.\nSpongeBob: But I don't want a new one, Squidward. My name tag is out there somewhere. Lost... Hungry... Who will help it? What if someone's using it?\nBank Robber: Alright! Nobody move! This is a bank robbery! Attica!\nSpongeBob: I'm innocent, I tell ya!  Squidward, what happened?\nSquidward: Hmm? Oh, you fainted because you lost your name tag or something.\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nSquidward: SpongeBob, will you get a hold of yourself? Since when is losing your name tag the end of the world?\nMr. Krabs: Attention, all employees! Just a quick heads-up, boys. There's going to be a surprise uniform inspection in one hour. Anyone who doesn't pass gets the boot!  This boot, to be exact. It's very stinky, and you'll have to wear it all day. See you in an hour.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, if you really want to find your name tag, just retrace your steps.\nSpongeBob: Retrace my steps? Squidward, you're a genius.\nSquidward: Huh. Huh. A genius? Well, I don't know about that, but...\nSpongeBob: Cover me till I get back, okay?\nSquidward: Oh, sure, sure.  A genius? Well, how about... Hey!\nSpongeBob: Let's see, if I'm going to retrace my steps, I got to remember everything I did this morning.\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Oh, hi Patrick.  You said hi to me this morning, right?\nPatrick: As I do every morning.\nSpongeBob: Well, I need you to do it again.\nPatrick: That wasn't part of the deal, SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you talking about?\nPatrick: My hellos aren't just some tape recording that you can rewind and play over and over. They're special!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, this is an emergency! I lost my name tag this morning, and I need to retrace my steps.\nPatrick: You lost your name tag?\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, you know the plan, right?\nPatrick: I got it, I got it. You're gonna retrace your steps and when you walk by me I say \"hi\", just like this morning.\nSpongeBob: Perfect. Hmm, I guess I should start with when I woke up.  I sure hope this works.  Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it!  So far, so good.  I don't see my name tag up here.  Now that my horrific moment of terror is over, how about some breakfast?  The most important meal of the day, serving it up Gary's way.  Bleah! Okay, next I just have to walk outside and say hi to Patrick.  Patrick!\nPatrick: What?\nSpongeBob: You were supposed to say hi to me!\nPatrick: Hi.\nSpongeBob: Oh. All right, let's take it from the top.\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Don't forget your line this time!\nPatrick: I won't.\nSpongeBob: Good morning, world, and all who inhabit it.  The most important meal of the day. La-la-la... Gary's way. Bleah.  Patrick, why didn't you say hi to me?!\nPatrick: What's my motivation?\nSpongeBob: Forget the motivation! Just say hi!\nPatrick: Hi, Patrick! Oh wait, I'm Patrick! I'm sorry. Sorry.  I'm sorry. Let's try it again.  Hi, SpongeBoob! Ha! SpongeBoob! I sai... I sai...  Who's SpongeBoob?! I said SpongeBoob! Again, again. Sorry people.  I've got the giggles.\nSpongeBob: Oh, what's the use? I'll never find my name tag in time for inspection.\nPatrick: Well, what did you do after I said hi to you this morning?\nSpongeBob: Hmm, let's see.  I skipped merrily to the Krusty Krab, said hello to Old Man Jenkins, placed an apple on Mr. Krabs' desk... and that's about it. Oh, and these two guys threw me in the dumpster.  Good one, guys!\nPatrick: That's it! Your name tag is in the apple on Mr. Krabs' desk!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're a genius. Oh wait, he's probably thrown it away by now.\nPatrick: Well, then we'll look in the dumpster!\nSpongeBob: Eh, what is that stench?\nPatrick: That is the stench of discovery. Come on, buddy. I'll give you a boost.  Hop on, pal.\nSpongeBob: Hey, it's not so bad once you get used to it.\nPatrick: I wish I had a nose.\nSpongeBob: Come on in, buddy. The garbage is fine.\nPatrick: Cannonball!\nSpongeBob: You look over there and I'll look over here.\nPatrick: Okay.\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\nPatrick: I'm looking. I'm looking.\nSpongeBob: Patrick? Patrick!\nPatrick: I'm looking as fast as I can.\nSpongeBob: Patrick!  Thank you.\nPatrick: Here, let me get that. Hey, look! A Stingray 5000 single. Hey, these guys rock. Why would anybody throw this away?\nSpongeBob: Have you  forgotten what we're looking for knee-deep in yesterday's Top 40 songs?!\nPatrick: Yes.\nSpongeBob: I'll give you a hint. Two words. First word: my. Second word: name tag.\nPatrick: Could I have another hint?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I would love to sit here and play Twenty Questions with you, but I've only got  one minute till inspection.  One minute?! Hurry, Patrick, we don't have much time.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob...\nSpongeBob: Not now, Patrick.\nPatrick: I know where your name tag is.\nSpongeBob: Where?! Where?!\nPatrick: Uh... I can't remember.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I don't have time for this!\nPatrick: There it is!\nSpongeBob: Where?!\nPatrick: Uh...  I forgot again.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, are you with me or against me?\nPatrick: Could you give me a hint?  There! I see it!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, yeah, yeah... the boy who cried name tag. If you're not going to help me, then just go crawl back under your rock!\nPatrick: Well, at least I don't wear my shirt backwards.\nSpongeBob: My shirt backward...  What the...?  My shirt's on backwards!  I had my identity all along.  Oh, and just in time. Thanks, Patrick.\nPatrick: Don't mention it, buddy.\nMr. Krabs: Fall in for inspection! All right, you two...  Hat and uniform seem to be in order.  Hmm, promise me you'll shave tonight and you pass.\nSquidward: Hoorah.\nMr. Krabs: Okay, boy, your turn.\nSpongeBob: I think you'll find everything shipshape.\nMr. Krabs: Ack! Jumpin' jellyfish! What's that stench?\nSpongeBob: Uh... discovery?  And that's how I got my identity back. Well, that's my story.\nWaitress: Well, you managed to kill eleven minutes.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, uh...  Betty.\nWaitress: What?  Oh, sweetie, I'm not Betty. I just borrowed her uniform while mine's at the cleaners.\n","58b\nPlankton's Army\nNarrator: Ah, the Krusty Krab. Home of the delicious Krabby Patty and its super-secret recipe.\nMr. Krabs: Attention, Krusty Krab crew! All hands report immediately!\nSpongeBob: Fry cook SpongeBob reporting, sir!\nSquidward: What's all the yelling about?\nMr. Krabs: Today is the 25th anniversary of the first time me arch-enemy Plankton ever tried to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.\nPlankton: Can I have the secret formula?\nMr. Krabs: No.\nPlankton: Okay.\nMr. Krabs: But he was persistent!\nPlankton: Pretty please?\nMr. Krabs: Uh-uh.\nMr. Krabs: He used disguises!  Super science!  Civil disobedience!  And I always came out on top!\nSquidward: Fascinating.\nMr. Krabs: But thousands of failures have made him crafty, so keep your eyes open!  You'll never know what trick he'll use to steal me secret Krabby Patty formula.\nRobot: What a quaint restaurant. I think I will sample their wares.\nSpongeBob: Ooh, how weird! A machine made to look like a customer.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob. Why don't you go hose out the men's room?\nSpongeBob: With pleasure, sir!\nMr. Krabs: I'll take this one.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I help you?\nRobot: Yes please. I'd like an order of chili coral bits.\nMr. Krabs: You sure you don't want a Krabby Patty?\nRobot: No, thank you.  Will this cover it?\nMr. Krabs: Uh, sure.  Here you go.\nRobot: Good day.\nMr. Krabs: Hm. I was sure it was one of Plankton's tricks. Well, at least his money's good.\nPlankton: AH-HAH!\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! You knew I would never distrust a dollar!\nPlankton: That's right, Krabs. Now hand over the secret Krabby Patty formula!\nMr. Krabs: Or what?\nPlankton: ...I don't know. I never thought I'd get this far.\nMr. Krabs: Well, then, allow me to suggest your next move.\nPlankton: Curse you,  Kra-a-aillllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nMr. Krabs: And now for the chaser!\nPlankton: You just wait, Krabs! Next time I'll... ah, who am I kidding? At least I can go home to a wife who understands.\nKaren: So? Tell me what happened.\nPlankton: I don't want to talk about it.\nKaren: Talking will make you feel better.\nPlankton: Leave me alone.\nKaren: That's your problem. You never let anyone in. Plankton the rock, Plankton the loner...\nPlankton: And she's off, ladies and gentlemen.\nKaren: ...and that's why everything you try ends up like this...  and like this...  and more recently, like this.\nPlankton: I'm a failure!\nKaren: It's not that bad! You just require a little help. Maybe some henchmen...\nPlankton: Henchmen?\nKaren: Yes, what you need to do is surround yourself with muscular tough guys who will do whatever you say.\nPlankton: I like the sound of that. I'll canvas all the seediest lowbrow dives in town to find my minions. And I know just how to speak their language!  Felicitations, malefactors! I am endeavoring to misappropriate the formulary for the preparation of affordable comestibles! Who will join me!?\nPlankton: I don't get it. No matter what I do, I always end up being squashed by someone bigger than me.\nKaren: Oh, come on. I think you're overreacting.  Sorry.\nPlankton: That's okay. I'm no different than the millions of other Plankton in the sea.  The Plankton family has always been pushed around and stepped on. Wait! That's it! Acting alone, we're powerless, but united, the Plankton family could be a real pain in the fanny!  Krabs may think one Plankton is no problem, but let's see him take on two, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand!  But why stop there? I'll gather every family member from every corner of the ocean. The entire Plankton family under one roof! Krabs won't stand a chance against the staggering intellect of a million super-smart criminal masterminds!  They're here! Welcome, brethren!\nClem: Hey, look, everybody! It's cousin Plankton!\nAll: Yee-haw!\nPlankton: I've been away from home longer than I thought.\nClem: Well, howdy, cousin!\nPlankton: Uh...\nClem: It's me, Clem. O' course, you remember Zeke, Rufus, Jeke, Billy Billy Bo-Illy Bonana Fanna Fo-Filly, Doug, Enos... ... Fletcher McGee, Rainchild, Zeke Junior...\nPlankton: Alright! I get it! I mean, uh, come inside. Make yourself at home.  I'd like you to meet my computer wife, Karen.\nClem: Golly, she sure is purdy, Sheldon.\nKaren: Sheldon?!\nPlankton: Yes, that's my first name.\nKaren: Sheldon?\nPlankton: Will you please-!\nKaren: Sorry!\nPlankton: All right, as I was saying...  Okay, we all know Sheldon's a funny name.\nKaren: Okay, okay. I'm done. No more.\nPlankton: Good. Ahem, to continue.  Only you can bring honor...  ...and dignity...  ...back to the Plankton name.  For years, it has been my goal to acquire the secret formula for...  Aha!  Okay, that's enough!  Bottom line: we invade the Krusty Krab so I can steal the secret formula. What do you think?\nFamily Member 1: But what's in it for us?\nPlankton: Well, what do you want?\nFamily Member 2: Gawrsh. Can I get a new string for my banjo?\nFamily Member 3: And another boot to match this'n?\nFamily Member 4: And some more memory for my laptop!\nClem: And what about root beer?\nAll: Root beer?!\nPlankton: Help me get the secret formula and you can have as much root beer as you can drink!  Victory, thy name is Plankton!\nMr. Krabs: Well, Mr. Squidward, it's almost closing time, and we haven't seen eye or antennae of ol' Plankton for hours. Yes, sir, I think this time, he's finally given up for...\nPlankton: Attention Krusty Krab management! This is your better speaking.\nMr. Krabs: What?!\nPlankton: I have the restaurant surrounded. Give me the secret formula or I'll destroy the Krusty Krab!\nMr. Krabs: Ah, you and what army, bug?\nPlankton: What army? What army?! Look around you, Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: You planted grass?\nPlankton: GRASS?!?\nMr. Krabs: Uh-oh.  You'll never get away with it, Plankton.\nPlankton: You're right. The pipes are much too narrow. Besides, what I really want is the Krabby Patty formula.\nMr. Krabs: Well, you might as well forget it. The formula is locked away in me safe, and I'll never give ya the combination.\nPlankton: Silence!  I think you'll find we're more than capable of figuring it out for ourselves. Oh, boys?  That's it, a little to the left...\nMr. Krabs: Curse you, Plankton, and your ability to join together to form a working human ear!\nPlankton: Hot dog!  Yes. It's mine! The formula's mine. After all these years, it's finally mine!  Let it be known that on this day, I, Sheldon J. Plankton, single-handedly overthrew the Krusty Krab!\nFamily: Ahem.\nPlankton: Eh, and, of course, I had a little help from the family.\nMr. Krabs: Plankton, wait. You can't look at the formula.\nPlankton: Begging won't help.\nMr. Krabs: I'm telling you, you won't be able to handle the truth. There are some things in this world that weren't meant for mortal eyes.\nPlankton: Eye.\nMr. Krabs: Eye.\nPlankton: I don't care. Drum roll please!  Finally, after all these years, I'm about to find out what makes a Krabby Patty taste so good.  The secret recipe for one Krabby Patty is... a pinch of salt...!\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! Wait!\nPlankton: ...Three teaspoons of chopped onions...!\nMr. Krabs: I'm warning ya...!\nPlankton: ...A cup of love...!\nMr. Krabs: Don't do it!\nPlankton: ...mixed together with the most important ingredient of all... four heaping pounds of freshly ground...!  ...Plankton?!\nMr. Krabs: I warned ya.\nMr. Krabs: Hey. Why ain't you running?\nClem: Well, I can't read.\nMr. Krabs: Get out of here!\nSpongeBob: Hey, guys. Did I miss anything?\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, is this really the secret ingredient for the Krabby Patty?\nMr. Krabs: Of course not!  And Plankton will probably figure that out and be back again to find out what the real formula is. But don't worry, boys, the formula's safe from harm. I got it hidden in me most secret hiding place, a place no one, not even Plankton, would ever figure out.\nSquidward: Let me guess. It's at home, under your mattress.\nMr. Krabs: Curse you, Squidward!\n","59\nThe Sponge Who Could Fly\nFrench narrator: Last week, a never-before-seen episode of SpongeBob SquarePants was discovered under a desk at Nickelodeon Studios.  Now all the world is waiting in fevered anticipation to watch...  the SpongeBob SquarePants Lost Episode!  Now, to present the Lost Episode, from Encino, California, the president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate!\nPotty: Patchy! Patchy! The kids're here.\nPatchy: Wagh!  Hot! Hot! Hot! Potty, don't you know this is Patchy\u2019s private time?  Oh, hello! Dahh!  What are you all doing here?\nPotty: They're here to see the lost episode. Brawk!\nPatchy: But I haven't got the lost episode because I... well, I lost it!\nChildren: No, Patchy! Please! Don't say that, Patchy! Please!\nPatchy: But it is! It's lost and I have no idea where it is, so it's best if you forget all about old SpongeBob.\nFrench narrator: Remembering SpongeBob.\nPatchy: I don't believe I lost the Lost Episode.  I never lose anything.\nPotty: What about your leg?\nPatchy: Well, yeah, but...\nPotty: And your eye.\nPatchy: Well, the eye, I...\nPotty: And your hand.\nPatchy: And the h... oh, get out of here you blasted bird!  Hmm... if only I had a map to tell me where the Lost Episode is.\nPotty: What is it? Brawk!\nPatchy: Hey... it's a map! It's a map to the Lost Episode of SpongeBob I lost!\nPotty: It's a dream come true!\nPatchy: We gotta go find it, Potty!  Oh, first I'll need me treasure hunting leg.  Come on, Potty! Ah! Times a-wastin'!\nPotty: Brawk!\nPatchy: Ten paces past Mrs. Johnson's house.\nMrs. Johnson: Would you boys like some cookies?\nPatchy: Put 'em in a doggie bag, Mrs. Johnson. Can't right now, we're on a treasure hunt.\nMrs. Johnson: Okay, don't catch a cold.\nPatchy: Walk five fathoms past Don's Import Store and Delicatessen.  Half a league to the forked tree.  Oh!  Now all that's left is... Huh?! The seven trials of monkey lagoon?!  Merciful Neptune. Only for SpongeBob. Only for SpongeBob!  Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa!  Ow!  Ahh... Ahh... Ah!  We made it! We survived the trials! Oh, I'm really gonna dig this lost episode!  Dig it, get it?\nPotty: You stink!\nPatchy: And I just got out of the shower.  Hey, Potty, I think I hit something.  Clever... bury your treasure above the surface.\nPotty: Brawk!\nPatchy: This is it!  I don't know what it means either.  But I got what I came for! Come on, Potty, time's a-wastin'.  Yeah! Popcorn.  Soda.  Pickled garlic!  Potty, hit the remote!\nPotty: Brawk!\nPatchy: This is gonna be great!  I can't believe it. More SpongeBob!  This is so exciting!  Here it comes!\nPotty: Brawk! Pipe down!\nPatchy: That's it? That's the Lost Episode? That was just a bunch of cheap walk cycles!\nPotty: What a rip.\nPatchy: Grrrrr...  SpongeBob betrayed us!  I'm sorry I ever started this stupid fan club in the first place!  I'm gonna get rid of all my SpongeBob stuff! All of it! All of it!  All of it!  I'm gonna run away, that's what I'll do! Run away!\nPotty: Sheesh, what a hothead!\nAnnouncer: And now, the real Lost Episode!\nPotty: Brawk! Patchy, come back! There's more!\nPatchy: Really?  Hooray! Let's watch!\nFrench narrator: Here we see the proud jellyfish hunter.  He stands motionless to lure the jellyfish into a false sense of security.  And when his prey ventures to close, he springs into action.\nSpongeBob: Huh?   Ooh!  Phew! I salute you, oh majestic jellyfish.  Your command of the sky is unmatched. Floating just out of the reach of my net, but near enough that I can see your untamed beauty.  \u266aIf only I could join you there in the air. Floating free without a care. I wish I could fly. And see things with a different eye.\u266a  \u266aI would fly so very high and touch the sky.\u266a  \u266aAnd never have to ask why it is that I can't fly\u266a  Wait a minute, I'm forgetting the words of Grandpa SquarePants.\nGrandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly, we'd have propellers on our heads or jet engines on our backs.\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna follow his advice, by gum. I'll invent a flying machine!\nPatrick: What's that contraption, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: That, Patrick, is a flying machine.\nSpongeBob: What's so funny?\nPatrick: Well, it's like my grandpa used to say.\nGrandpa SquarePants: If we were meant to fly, uh... hey, I'm not your grandfather!\nSpongeBob: Well, here I go, Patrick!  I'm off to fly with the jellyfish! Ignition, check!  Landing gear...  check! Complimentary peanuts...  check-a-roo.  Ready for takeoff!\nPatrick: You cut a hole in Farmer Jenkins' grain silo!\nSpongeBob: Don't remind me.\nJenkins: I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines! Now git!\nPatrick: We better do what he says. He knows how to grow food!\nSpongeBob: Well, it took me all night, but here they are. The new blueprints! I wasn't even close with that last one. Propellers, rudders...  This one's gonna fly!  I can feel it. Ready, Patrick?\nPatrick: Ready!\nSpongeBob: It's working, Patrick! I'm flying! I'm...  falling!  Ooh!\nSpongeBob: This is it, Patrick. The physics are all here. This time, I'm gonna fly!\nPatrick: Oh boy, a birthday party!\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. This is the SquarePants Flyer Mark Three.  All you do is remove the brick, or ballast, and...  Huh?  Well, back to the drawing board.\nPatrick: Can we have the cake now?  Happy, happy birthday to you!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, get ready to say \"Eureka!\"\nPatrick: Okay!\nSpongeBob: Go!  It's working! I'm flying!\nCap Fish: Hey! Look at that guy tied to a kite!\nFred: Why's he doing that?\nNancy: Oh my goodness...\nFred: Why's he doing that?\nCap Fish: He'll fall and break his...\nNancy: Can you see from up there?\nSpongeBob: Do not be afraid, earthbound people. I am not a flying monster, I am just one of you.  D'oh!  Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick! Ow! Patrick!  Excuse me, sir, but I would like to return this kite.\nVendor: Hey... I know you. Yeah, from today's paper!\nSpongeBob: \"Local nutcase tries to fly\"?! I'm a nutcase because I follow my dreams? Well, they laughed at the guy who invented light bulbs, too!\nVendor: No they didn't.\nSpongeBob: You'll see.\nMonroe: Look mom, it's the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom.\nMable: Wow! I wonder why he's still using his legs.\nMonroe: Come on, Bird Man. Flap your wings and fly!\nCap Fish: Hey, Bird Man, going to check on your eggs?\nNancy: Maybe he's looking for a statue to poop on.\nSpongeBob: Go on and laugh, but it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!\nMother #2: You think you're the only one with unfulfilled dreams?\nStubble Fish: I was supposed to be a concert pianist... until I realized I didn't have any fingers.\nNat: We all had dreams.\nNancy: What makes you so special?\nMob: Let's get him!\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nNat: Good riddance, dreamer!\nSpongeBob: Ooh!  Well, it can't get any worse. D'oh!  I guess I spoke too soon.\nFrench narrator:  Will SpongeBob learn to fly? Stay tuned.\nSpongeBob: There they go again, Gary.  I suppose I'll never join them in the sky. I'll be stuck on the ground, sentenced to a flightless life.  Oh well. I guess all dreams aren't meant to come true.  Back to reality.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: No, Gary, my dreams are silly.  Hello? No, this isn't the Bird Man of Bikini Bottom. What?  No, I certainly do not live in a birdcage. Who is this? Joe Momma? Well, listen up, Joe.  I hate to break it to you, but flying is impossible.  I have to go now. My head just hit the ceiling. Huh? Hey! Look, Gary!  I... I think I'm flying! Jellyfish Fields, here I come!\nMonroe: Mom, look! It's the flying guy!\nMable: Wow, I guess he wasn't a lunatic after all.\nSpongeBob: \u266aI'm flying. I'm flying!\u266a\nCitizens: \u266aHe's flying!\u266a  \u266aHe's flying!\u266a  \u266aHe's really, really flying!\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aThey laughed, they scoffed, before I had liftoff.\u266a\nCitizens: \u266aBut now he's flying.\u266a  \u266aHe's flying high in the sky.\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aI'd love to hang around to say I told you so.\u266a  \u266aBut it's off to Jellyfish Fields I go!\u266a  \u266aRoads and streets are not for me.\u266a\nMrs. Puff: \u266aHelp! Please help! My snail is up a tree. I've had her since I was a little girl.\u266a  \u266aBut now it looks like the end of her world.\u266a  No!\nSpongeBob: Gotcha!  Next time, try the elevator.\nMrs. Puff: Thank you, Bird Man!\nSpongeBob: \u266aI have never felt so free!\u266a  \u266aHigh in the sky is the place for me.\u266a  \u266aHelping friends from up above.\u266a  \u266aThese are the things that I love!\u266a  \u266aI'll help Mr. Krabs reclaim his dime.\u266a\nMr. Krabs: I'm rich!\nSpongeBob: \u266aAnd I'll save Patrick from this mime!\u266a\nPatrick: Thanks, buddy!\nSpongeBob: \u266aEven Plankton needs some help, when he gets tangled in the ke-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-elllllllp!\u266a\nPlankton: Please put me down!\nFish Head: All of Bikini Bottom is abuzz over the identity of a mysterious flying man who helps people.\nTom: He found my hair piece!\nTyler: He helps people... and he flies... and he helps people.\nFish Head: Who knows what superhero act of courage he'll astound us with next?\nNat: Oh no! The light in the Goo Lagoon lighthouse went out, and Sailor Jenkins is headed for the coastline!\nJenkins: I'm glad I gave up farming!\nSpongeBob: I'm coming!\nNat: Thanks, mysterious flying man!\nJenkins: I knew no good would come from city folk and their flying machines!\nSpongeBob: That's enough good deeds for one day. I've got a date with a flock of jellyfish.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Son! I need you and your magical pants!\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, I invented these pants so I could fly with the jellyfish! If I keep doing favors for people I'll never make my dreams a reality.\nMr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, it's an emergency!\nSpongeBob: Let's roll!  Where to, Mr. K?\nMr. Krabs: Uh... my garage.\nSpongeBob: You've got it!  What's the emergency, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Are you sure you're up for it, boy?\nSpongeBob: I think my pants can handle it.\nMr. Krabs: I need you...\nSpongeBob: Yes?\nMr. Krabs: To clean...\nSpongeBob: Clean up crime?\nMr. Krabs: My garage.\nSpongeBob: That's your emergency?\nMr. Krabs: But, SpongeBob, everyone knows it's easier to clean a garage when you can fly!\nSpongeBob: All right, Mr. Krabs. I'll clean your garage. But after this, no more favors!  All done, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: And the recyclables?\nSpongeBob: Aw, shrimp.  Finally!

Come on, everybody! I think a proper burial is in order.  A pair of pants like these come around... once in a lifetime.\nSpongeBob: Well, it was fun while it lasted.  I guess I'm not meant to fly after all.  Huh? Hey! My jellyfish friends are helping me fly! Without pants!

You taught me a valuable lesson. Although I'm not quite sure what it was.\nPatrick: Hey! Let's fly down to the pizza house for a slice.\nSpongeBob: No more flying for me, Patrick. I'll leave that to the jellyfish.\nPatrick: Suit yourself.\nSpongeBob: Did Patrick just...?  Nah!\nPatchy: Wow! Wasn't that great, kids?\nPotty: Let's watch it again.\nPatchy: That's a great idea, Potty.  Where's the remote?  Where's the remote?  Oh, I lost the remote! They should make those things...  Eh...\nPotty: Brawk!\nPatchy: My remote!  Thanks, stranger!\nMrs. Johnson: Don't mention it, Patchy!\nPatchy: Now, which one of these cockamamie buttons is rewind?  No, that's not it.  D'oh! Wrong again.\nPotty: Brawk! Let me do it!\nPatchy: No, get away!  That's the light switch! Give me that!\nPotty: Brawk! That's the mariachi band button.\nPatchy: Grrrrr...

Now it's lost forever!\nPotty: Brawk! Lost forever!\nFrench narrator: Oh boy, what a loser. Well, I guess the lost episode will remain lost. But, tape or no tape, as long as there are stars in the sky, SpongeBob will live on in our hearts and in our minds.  Now get lost. I mean, bye. No, really, get lost.\n","60a\nSpongeBob Meets the Strangler\nSpongeBob: Wait for it...\nAutomated Voice: On Time Percentage: 100%.\nSquidward: Another day, another migraine. Heh, heh, mi...\nAutomated Voice: On Time Percentage: 12%.\nSquidward: ...graine. Heh, heh, heh.\nSpongeBob: Ahh, isn't it great working at the Krusty Krab, Squidward? Huh? Isn't it? Working here?\nSquidward: Yeah, great.\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\nSquidward: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: Aww, yeah.\nSquidward: Yes...\nSpongeBob: Hold that thought, Squidward. I'm doing the parking lot for early morning litter patrol. May Neptune shine brightly on my harvest.  Litter.  Looks like someone missed the trash basket, huh, Mr. Candy Wrapper?  Kids these days.  I've never seen such an epidemic! Well, at least it's all over now.  Where is all this litter coming from?!  Not on my watch.  Sir, I will have you know it's against the law to litter.\nStrangler: Heh, what're you gonna do, call the police?\nSpongeBob: Yes.\nSquidward: How's it going, Lieutenant?\nSpongeBob: Well, let's just say I hope our litterbug there saved room for his just desserts.

I need a bodyguard!  Mr. Krabs! There's a maniac after me! I need a bodyguard.\nMr. Krabs: I wasn't five-time 'Golden Claws' in the navy for nothin'! When he sees me moves, he'll be running scared. So, where is this little bully? Down at the park? The sodey shop? What does he look like, eh, boy?\nSpongeBob: This would be him, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: The Tattletale Strangler?  Go away, SpongeBob! Take your death cloud with you!\nSpongeBob: Ugh, that's it. I gotta get out of town 'til I can find a bodyguard.\nStrangler: Bodyguard, huh? I might be able to help you out.\nSpongeBob: You don't understand, mister. I need protection from the scariest guy in town. Here's his picture.\nStrangler: Heh heh, he doesn't look so tough.\nSpongeBob: I tattled on him, and now he wants to strangle me with his diabolical hands! I hope they're not dirty.\nStrangler: Huh? Uh-oh. Uh, there's too many witnesses around here.  Listen, kid. I could be your bodyguard. Here's my card.\nSpongeBob: Hmm, looks good to me. You're hired! I feel safer already. What's next?\nStrangler: Well, the maniac could be anywhere, wearing a disguise. He could be that old man.  Or that baby.\nSpongeBob: Or that pebble.  Or that stick.  Or that receipt for the Phony Baloney Mustache Emporium!\nStrangler: Huh? Uhh, that's mine.\nSpongeBob: Oh, bodyguard, my body is in your guarding hands. What do we do first?\nStrangler: Well, I suggest we go to a nice, quiet, secluded location, uh, like behind an old dumpster or a dark alley...\nSpongeBob: We could go to my house and turn off all the lights!\nStrangler: Perfect. That way no one can hear you being strangled... err, I mean, uhh, protected.  Perfect.\nSpongeBob: Yes, excellent.  Ah, but first, I gotta do a few errands.\nStrangler: Uhh, okay, but let's make it quick.\nSpongeBob: Quick is my middle name!  Let's see...paper towels. This one says 'best paper towel around' this one says 'best paper towel in town'. Hmm... in town... around... in town... around... what do you think, bodyguard?\nStrangler: Whatever gets us to your house quicker.\nSpongeBob: I'll take both!\nDry Cleaner: Here you go, Mr. SquarePants.\nSpongeBob: Hmmm.\nDry Cleaner: Is there something wrong?\nSpongeBob: I'm not sure if these are my pants.  How about this one, bodyguard? Too overbearing?\nStrangler: Can we just go to your house?!\nSpongeBob: Here we are. SquarePants Manor! Bodyguard, let me just take this opportunity to say you're the best bodyguard a fella could hope to have.\nStrangler: All right, enough of the sappy talk! Open the door so I can strangle you... I mean, uhh, choke you... I mean, uhh, crush your windpipe... gah, I mean...\nSpongeBob: Protect me?\nStrangler: Thanks.\nSpongeBob: Don't mention it, Strangler.  I mean, bodyguard. Now where'd I put my key?\nNarrator: Twenty minutes later...\nSpongeBob: Well, I can't find 'em. You wanna take a look?\nStrangler: Oh, forget the key! Let's climb through this window.  I can't reach it. Do you think you could hop up on my shoulders, kid?\nSpongeBob: Sure! With these spiky cleats, anything is possible!  Ya!\nStrangler: Cleats?!  Get your feet out of my eye sockets!\nSpongeBob: I'm trying, but my cleats are stuck in your corneas!\nNarrator: Six hours later...\nSpongeBob: Don't be mad, bodyguard. Let me just grab the key I keep under the mat and we can get inside.  There you are, you little rascal. Now, to put the key in the lock, which should activate the tumblers, thus opening the door.  Step inside...\nStrangler: Close the door...\nSpongeBob: Well, here we are!\nStrangler: I've finally got you all alone!\nSpongeBob: I know, isn't it great?  Ooh.\nStrangler: Now, you're gonna get yours... tattletale!\nAll of SpongeBob's friends: Surprise!\nSpongeBob: A surprise party to celebrate my perfect on-time percentage at work?

I gotta turn myself in!\nSpongeBob: So, Patrick's the Strangler. Gee, you think you know a guy.\nStrangler: HE\u2019S NOT THE STRANGLER!!!!!!\nSpongeBob: He's not?\nStrangler: I AM!!!!\nSpongeBob: Hey, how'd you do that without shaving cream?\nStrangler: Oh, It's a fake, you idiot!! I bought it at the party store!!\nSquidward: Did someone say 'party'?\nStrangler: I can't take it!\nSpongeBob: Wait, bodyguard, I need protection!\nStrangler: Step on it! I'm being chased by a maniac!\nSpongeBob: I'm not safe! Come back!\nStrangler: Finally, away from that guy.\nSpongeBob: Good idea, bodyguard. He'll never find us up here.  Good thinking, bodyguard. The Strangler could have been on that plane.  Bodyguard, bodyguard!\nStrangler: Look, kid... I'm not your bodyguard!  I'm the Strangler! See?!\nSpongeBob: The Strangler!\nOfficer Nancy: Good work, SpongeBob.

I'm gonna have some of your delicious Seanut Brittle!  Where's the Seanut Brittle?\nSpongeBob: That gets funnier every time you say it, Patrick. Come on, let's go inside.\nPatrick: Seanut Brittle?\nSpongeBob: Ah!  Nothing compares to the smell of cheap plastic novelty items.  Pranks, gags, and gross-out toys as far as the eye can see!  Isn't it everything I said it would be, Patrick?\nPatrick: Hey, Seanut Brittle!  Oh, darn it, not again!\nFrank: Good to see you, SpongeBob. How's my number one customer doing?\nSpongeBob: Great, Frank. This is my friend Patrick. He wants to become a prankster, too.\nFrank: Well, pleasure to meet you, Patrick.  That's your first lesson, son, the granddaddy of all pranks. The joy buzzer.\nPatrick: I don't get it.\nFrank: You don't have to get it. The prank is for the enjoyment of the prankster.\nSpongeBob: You see, Patrick, Frank here is the master. I learned all I know about pranks from him. Okay, Frank, let's see what you've got.\nFrank: Well, this came in just this morning.  Have some gum.  Ha! Exploding chewing gum. Only $9.95.\nPatrick: I don't get it.\nSpongeBob: What can we get for one dollar?\nFrank: One dollar will get you this fake gag dollar--  fool your friends into thinking you've got a real dollar.\nSpongeBob: What else have you got?\nFrank: A whoopee cushion.\nSpongeBob: Nah.\nFrank: Fake vomit.\nSpongeBob: No.\nFrank: Real vomit?\nSpongeBob: Eww!

Now be careful with that stuff, boys. It stains clothes.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Frank.  Here it is, Patrick. The ultimate prank-- invisible spray.\nPatrick: What are we gonna do with it?\nSpongeBob: I know! We'll go spray the park bench and then sit on it, and when people walk by, we'll be floating in midair.\nNat: They're floating in midair!\nTina-Fran: How do they do that?\nPatrick: That's the ultimate prank! Good idea, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Well, let's get started.\nPatrick: Okay, I'm ready.\nSpongeBob: Any particular reason you took your pants off?\nPatrick: Well, that stuff stains clothes, right?\nSpongeBob: That it does, Patrick, that it does. Good thinking. Here, hold this a second.  Okay, Patrick, give me the can.\nPatrick: I think since spraying the park bench was my idea, I should get to spray it.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, spraying the park bench was my idea.\nPatrick: Yeah, but I said it was a good idea!\nSpongeBob: Give me that thing.\nPatrick: Hey, the invisible spray works!\nTom: And on your right, if you look, you'll see two naked guys fighting over a can of paint!\nSpongeBob: Oh my gosh, Patrick, help me find our clothes!\nPatrick: I gotta hand it to you, SpongeBob. You look kinda funny.\nSpongeBob: Righty, where are you?  No one messes with Righty!  We'll see how you like it!  Kind of gives you an empty feeling, huh?\nPatrick: Yeah.  I see what you mean.\nSpongeBob: No guts, no glory!\nNarrator: Several bad puns later...\nPatrick: Oh, hey, I think this thing is empty.\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, it can't be! How are we going to pull off the ultimate prank? Thanks a lot, Patrick. You used the last of it.\nPatrick: Hey, I think I found our pants.  Oops! Here, these are yours.\nSpongeBob: Oh, forget the pants, Patrick. Let's get home and wash this paint off.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, do you know what time it is?\nSpongeBob: Oh sure, it's...half past invisible.\nPatrick: Gee, it's getting late.\nSpongeBob: Let's ask this guy. Excuse me, sir, but do you have the time?\nNat: Sure.  It's, uh, ten to three.\nSpongeBob: Thank you.\nNat: Don't mention it.\nPatrick: Don't mention what?\nNat: Uh, who said that?\nPatrick: Me.\nNat: Ghosts!\nPatrick: Hey, I'm no ghost! The nerve of that guy and his driving eyeballs.\nSpongeBob: Wait a second, Patrick, my brain just hatched an idea.\nPatrick: Lay it on me.\nSpongeBob: Okay, we're invisible, right?\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: If that guy thought we were ghosts, we could haunt everybody in Bikini Bottom. Oh, it's the ultimate prank.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Whoo! High five!\nSpongeBob: Let's go scare us some suckers!\nSandy: Huh?  Well, that's funny, I thought I heard voices. Huh?  I thought I left that glass of peanut juice on the table.  And didn't I toss that old lamp out yesterday? And since when did I acquire all these portraits of Patrick?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're ghosts.\nSandy: I knew it was you guys! Alright, joke's over. Take off the sheets.  It is ghosts!\nSpongeBob: Boy, we really scared her!\nPatrick: Who's gonna be our next victim?\nSpongeBob: A better question would be, \"Who isn't?\"\nMrs. Puff: Double-dark deep-sea light diet cake!

The whole town thinks we're ghosts.\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: There's only one guy left to scare, and we'll have pranked everybody in Bikini Bottom--  Mr. Krabs.\nPatrick: It says he isn't scared of ghosts.\nSpongeBob: We'll see about that!\nMr. Krabs: Ghosts? Ha! I ain't afraid of no ghosts! Every sailor knows a ghost won't come near a fella as long as he's wearing his spotted neckerchief...  And his dried-up sea leprechaun.  And a bit of gold never hurt.  But to be on the safe side, I'm also wearing me pants in a melvin knot,  got me shivering timber brace,  and the hairs on the back of me neck are taped down.  And I'm all wrapped up in a suit of anti-ghost armor. And if none of this stuff works, I've got me secret weapon\u2014the specter deflector!  So just try and get me, you ghosts! Bring it on.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Wha?\nSpongeBob: Krabs, we've come to haunt you.\nMr. Krabs: Stay back, I'm well-armed!\nMr. Krabs: I'm warning ya!\nMr. Krabs: Ooh!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Boo.\nMr. Krabs: I gotta get out of here!\nSpongeBob: You can't escape, Krabs. We've glued the door shut.\nMr. Krabs: You'll never get me!\nPatrick: Nice try, Krabs, but we replaced all the glass with rubber!\nSpongeBob: Too late, Krabs, we've already clogged all the toilets.\nMr. Krabs: Please, spirits, leave me be.\nPatrick: We got him good, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, I've got one more idea.  You're going to pay, Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: No, spirits, please!\nSpongeBob: Pay!\nMr. Krabs: No!\nSpongeBob: Pay!\nMr. Krabs: No! Don't burn me dollar!  Well, well, well, if it isn't SpongeBob and Patrick.\nSpongeBob: I know not these names of which you speak.\nPatrick: Uh, SpongeBob. SpongeBob, we're visible again.\nMr. Krabs: So you two are the Bikini Bottom ghosts.\nSpongeBob: We're really sorry, Mr. Krabs. Please don't chop us into little pieces and eat 'em.\nMr. Krabs: Hey, come on, boys, I'm hip! I pulled my share of pranks when I was your age. Had me some laughs. That's what we did tonight, right? We had a good laugh. Come on, laugh with me.  Uh, any particular reason you boys are naked?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, the invisible paint stains clothes.\nMr. Krabs: Of course it does. Well, you two better hurry home before someone sees ya nude.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I think I'd die of embarrassment if that happened.\nPatrick: Me too.\nMr. Krabs: Woo, now we wouldn't want that, would we? It's getting late now. You two pranksters better get going.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, thanks for being such a good sport.\nMr. Krabs: Don't mention it.\nSpongeBob: That Mr. Krabs, always looking out for me.

Good, let's do that.\nSpongeBob: Um, you're making me nervous.\nPlankton: Oh, okay.  I'll be over here, then.\nSpongeBob: I'm finished!  I've arranged them into a piano.\nPlankton: Since your mind has been resistant to every mental technique so far, I'm forced to resort to my most powerful method of curing you.\nSpongeBob: Fiber?\nPlankton: No, hypnosis.\nSpongeBob: Hypnosis?!\nPlankton: Now, keep your eyes on this watch.  When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. 1...uh, 2...uh, 3.  I can't believe it worked. Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awake and tell me the formula.  Hey, wake up!  Hmm, what else is loud and obnoxious?  Why won't you wake up?!\nSpongeBob: Where am I?\nKrabby Patty: Hey, SpongeBob. I heard your brain was sick, so I brought you this cookie pizza.\nSpongeBob: Gee, thanks!\nKrabby Patty: And here's some chocolate milk.\nSpongeBob: The king of flavored dairy drinks!  Oh, Krabby Patty, I'm so glad we're friends again.\nKrabby Patty: Just remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you right here  .\nSpongeBob: In my heart?\nKrabby Patty: Actually, in your arteries. Now, do me a favor and wake up. Wake up.\nPlankton: Wake up!\nSpongeBob: It worked! I'm cured!\nPlankton: But what about the formula?\nSpongeBob: Oh, you're right! I'd better get back to work!  Thanks for everything, doc!\nPlankton: No! It's a lie! Therapy doesn't really work! You're still sick! Very, very sick!\nMr. Krabs: Good to see you're brain's all fixed, boy.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I just needed some sleep, is all.\nMr. Krabs: Well, I can safely say, \"No more 24 hour shifts\", because 23 hours will be plenty!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs...!\nMr. Krabs: No, seriously. Get back to work!\n","61b\nShell of a Man\nSpongeBob: Easy...  Perfection!\nSquidward: Is number 5's order ready yet, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Just a second, Squidward. Well, Krabby Patty, it's time for you to go now.  You grew up so fast, I...  Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't do this.  Just take it Squidward, take it away.\nSquidward: Oh, brother.  Number 5. Number 5!\nSpongeBob: That's me!  Mmm. My compliments to the chef!  Hello, what's this?\nMr. Krabs: Come out here, boy.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Hush boy, or you'll give away the location of me hidey-hole.\nSpongeBob: What's a hidey-hole?\nMr. Krabs: It's where I hide me treasure.  Catch!  Let's get that chest to the office, boy, pronto!\nSpongeBob: What's in this thing? Treasure?\nMr. Krabs: A treasure trove of sorts. It's me memory chest from my years in the navy.\nSpongeBob: Why'd you dig up your navy chest, sir?\nMr. Krabs: Well, my navy buddies and I are having a reunion. And I wanted to wear me old uniform.\nSpongeBob: Wow, look at all your cool navy stuff! What's that?\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh!  It's me first tattoo.\nSpongeBob: Neat.\nMr. Krabs: And this is me 'Manly Toughness Trophy'.\nSpongeBob: How'd you win that?\nMr. Krabs: By being the toughest of the tough!\nSpongeBob: Wow! Oh-oh. Who are those guys?\nMr. Krabs: Me shipmates. The toughest bunch to ever sail the briny deep. There's \"'Ol Iron Eye\", , and \"Mutton Chop\", , me, , \"Torpedo Belly\", , and \"Lockjaw Jones\".\nSpongeBob: Did you have a cool nickname, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Of course! I was called \"Armor Abs Krabs\".\nSpongeBob: You were?\nMr. Krabs: What do you mean?\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess you were thinner back then.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, really?  This is me navy cadet uniform. Prepare to eat your words 'cause I haven't put on more than a couple of pounds.  Ok, maybe I'm a bit bigger. But I'm still the toughest of the tough. Go ahead, lad, give em a punch.\nSpongeBob: You want me to punch you in the stomach?\nMr. Krabs: Not in the stomach! In me armor abs!\nSpongeBob: wow, my entire arm disintegrated.\nMr. Krabs: I still got it. Now be a good lad and go get your station in ship shape. And leave an old sea-dog to revel in his memories.\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir!  Alright, let's get this place ship shape. You men, stop laying around!  To battle stations.  All hands on deck!

Mr. Krabs!  I don't smell his pulse.  What's that?  Is somebody there?\nMr. Krabs: Don't look at me! Leave me be!\nSpongeBob: You're alive! And naked...\nMr. Krabs: It's true. I've molted.\nSpongeBob: What's molted?\nMr. Krabs: It's when a crab gets too fat- um, er, outgrows his shell. It falls off!\nSpongeBob: Wow.\nMr. Krabs: 'Armor Abs Krabs' can't show up at the reunion like this. All pink and soft and unmanly. I'm all flab and no ab!\nSpongeBob: Barnacles!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Sorry about the foul language, Mr. Krabs, but you're acting like there never was a man in that shell. The Krabs of his navy days was fearless. He wouldn't let something as insignificant as a missing shell slow him down.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: Who cares how silly, pink & fleshy you look. How non-threatening, limp & soft you are. How...  ...oops.\nMr. Krabs: I can't go anywhere ever again. Stupid, no good...\nSpongeBob: Wow, it sure is dark in here.  Look, Mr. Krabs, I'm you!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're a genius.\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm glad you got my point. It's not what's about on the outside. It's what's on the in...\nMr. Krabs: No, you barnacle brain. Not your silly metaphor. You, in me shell. It gives me an idea. You can go to the reunion and pretend to be me.\nSpongeBob: I get to be a navy buddy?\nMr. Krabs: Course, you'll need some time to approximate me personality.\nSpongeBob: Oh, that'll be a snap. Squidward and I have been doing it behind your back for years.\nMr. Krabs: Alright, show me what you got.\nSpongeBob: Look at me, I'm Mr Krabs. I love money.\nMr. Krabs: Heh heh, say that ain't half-bad.\nSpongeBob: I once won a marathon because someone dropped a penny at the finish line.\nMr. Krabs: That's me.\nSpongeBob: Every night, I tuck me wallet in and tell it a bedtime story.  Goodnight, wallety.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, okay, I get the point.\nSpongeBob: Oh, what's that you say? Me daughter, Pearl, needs an operation? I'll do it me self and save a nickel.\nMr. Krabs: That'll do, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Well, here goes...wow. I've never seen so many manly naval men. So tough, so brave, so...clever. And I'm one of them!\nMr. Krabs: No you're not. Don't blow this for me, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: I won't let you down, sir.\nMutton Chop: Armor Abs Krabs. Come join your navy buddies in a toast.\nSpongeBob: Coming!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, what have I done?\nSpongeBob: Okay, boys, let the SS Party drop anchor right here.\nMr. Krabs: I've created a monster.\nLockjaw Jones: Here's some grog. You still like pineapple, right?\nSpongeBob: Like pineapple? I live in one.\nTorpedo Belly: That Ol' Krabs is manly as ever.\nMr. Krabs: I don't believe it. SpongeBob is pulling it off.\nMutton Chop: Hey, Armor Abs, Ol' Iron Eye here has been itching to punch your legendary gut.\nSpongeBob: Well, if you think you're man enough.\nMr. Krabs: Uh-oh, this could be bad.\nSpongeBob: Fire the torpedoes.\nMutton Chop: What do you say, Krabs? Just like old times.\nLockjaw Jones: A tooth.\nTorpedo Belly: Teeth. Now, that's manly.\nMr. Krabs: He did it.\nCaptain: Alright, me swabbys, it's time to award the trophy of manly toughness. To a man who's toughness has stewed the test of time. And that man is: Eugene Armor Abs Krabs! Come up here , Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: This is the best night of my life. Me naval buddies still think I'm manly. And I didn't have to shed myself.\nNaval Buddies: Armor Abs! Armor Abs! Armor Abs!\nSpongeBob: Thanks for the trophy, everybody.\nNaval Buddies: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!\nSpongeBob: I...uhh...\nMr. Krabs: Say something.\nSpongeBob: Let me spin you a manly yarn.\nMr. Krabs: 'Atta boy.\nSpongeBob: So there I was, in Jellyfish Fields.\nMr. Krabs: I'm doomed.\nSpongeBob: Me supply of bubble soap was dangerously low. And as I blew my last bubble...\nMutton Chop: Did he say Jellyfish Fields?\nIron Eye: Blowing bubbles?\nMutton Chop: Uhh, what were you doing in Jellyfish Fields?\nSpongeBob: Why, jellyfishing, of course.\nNaval Buddies: Huh?\nMr. Krabs: Phone call for Mr. Krabs!   Get off the stage.\nSpongeBob: Oh, well, I gotta go. Uhh, thanks.\nTorpedo Belly: Where do you think you're going? Everybody knows there's two things Ol' Armor Abs Krabs would never do.\nMr. Krabs: Oh no.\nLockjaw Jones: Number one, is spend a penny.\nTorpedo Belly: And the other one, is leave without giving Ol' Torpedo Belly one of your world famous steely belly butts. Haha\nSpongeBob: Oh, I thought you'd see through my ruse. I mean,  arr, you don't think I was just gonna collect this here trophy of manly toughness without reminding you silly livers why you give it to me in the first place. Let's have it. No holding back. Give it your all.\nMr. Krabs: I can't watch.\nTorpedo Belly: Armor Abs?\nSpongeBob: Well, uhh, I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, I guess I'll take my manly toughness trophy and head home now. See you around manville, boys, uhh, men.\nMr. Krabs: No! He's not Eugene Krabs. I am.  Alright, lads, take a good look. This is who I am. I've molted me shell and I'm vulnerable.  But I'm certainly no bubble-blowing jellyfisher. No offense, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: None taken, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: C'mon, lad, let's go home.\nMutton Chop: Wait a minute! You've forgotten something.\nMr. Krabs: I don't understand.\nMutton Chop: Admitting you lost your shell is the toughest thing I've ever seen. And, uhh, I have a confession.  These are fake!\nTorpedo Belly: Over here.\nMr. Krabs: You, too, Torpedo Belly?\nTorpedo Belly: Actually, I had my torpedo removed long ago.\nLockjaw Jones: And these aren't the same choppers that I had in the navy.\nIron Eye: My iron eye is actually made of Formica.\nSpongeBob: Look at that, Mr. Krabs. Your navy buddies all had something to hide.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, poor suckers. At least my shell will grow back.\n","62a\nThe Lost Mattress\nSquidward: Wow, I'm really late again. Maybe they'll finally fire me.  Locked?\nSpongeBob: This isn't happening. This isn't happening!\nSquidward: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: The horror, it's unspeakable!  Don't you see, Squidward? It's closed! The Krusty Krab is closed!\nSquidward: You mean I got out of bed for nothing?\nSpongeBob: The doors are locked. The doors are locked and we are on the outside. Outsiders. What are we going to do, Squidward? There are Krabby Patties inside all alone.\nMr. Krabs: Just stand aside, lad, and let me unlock the door.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you're here!  Gosh, Mr. Krabs, we were worried something might have happened to you. That the world would've been deprived of the greatest food known to man.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, you made me drop me keys. Give me some space, lad. Can't a crab get a little space now?\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.\nSquidward: Harsh.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, me back!\nSpongeBob: Are you hurt, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: No. I'm just doubled over in pain, fightin' back tears in me eyes because it's a new dance craze!\nSpongeBob: Oh good, I thought you were hurt.\nMr. Krabs: I am hurt, ya idiot!  I'm sorry I snapped at ya, laddie. It's just me back is killing me. It's me old, lumpy mattress. It's like trying to sleep on broken coral. I'm going out of me mind.  Oh, me back.\nSpongeBob: Poor Mr. Krabs. What are we going to do, Squidward?\nSquidward: Why do anything? I like the new Mr. Krabs. He yells at you more.\nSpongeBob: I'm serious, Squidward.\nSquidward: So am I.\nSpongeBob: We should get Mr. Krabs a new mattress and surprise him with it as a gift. Then we'll never have to be late to work again.\nSquidward: What? You want me to spend my hard earned money on my richer than me skin flint boss? No, thank you.\nSpongeBob: That's okay, Squidward, you'll warm up to the idea.  Thanks for coming with me, Patrick.\nPatrick: No problem, buddy. I always wanted to go to a mattress store.\nSpongeBob: I've never seen so many mattress.\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: How many do you think there are?\nPatrick: 10.\nSpongeBob: Cool.\nEmployee: There's plenty more than that. Try them out. Find one you like.\nSquidward: What are you morons doing?\nSpongeBob: Making a card for Mr. Krabs. To go with his new mattress.\nSquidward: Oh, I see. You're just kissing up to the boss to make me look bad. Well, I won't stand for it. Gimme that card.  Trying to outsmart me, will ya?  There, I signed it for all of us.\nPatrick: Hey, you didn't even help pay.\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's okay, as long as Mr. Krabs is happy with his new mattress .\nMr. Krabs: Oh, me back. Well, here goes another useless attempt to sleep on me mount less, lumpy mattress.  Huh, that's queer. Me mattress seems strangely cozy and butter-like...\nSpongeBob, Patrick & Squidward: Surprise!\nMr. Krabs: Armageddon! What? Oh, you? What in the blue eye scallop are you doing in me bedroom?\nSpongeBob: We noticed how miserable you were on your lumpy, old mattress.\nSquidward: So I suggested we get you a new one.\nPatrick: I thought it was your idea.\nMr. Krabs: So, where's me old mattress then?\nSquidward: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I took care of that personally, too. I had it hauled away to the dump.\nMr. Krabs: All my money was in that mattress!\nSquidward: What?! Haven't you ever heard of a bank?!\nMr. Krabs: No!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: No!\nPatrick: And we got you a card.\nMr. Krabs: Is there money in it?\nPatrick: Nope.\nSpongeBob: Is it serious, doctor? Will Mr. Krabs be alright?\nDoctor: Mr. Krabs is in a cash-coma. Only the return of his money can save his life.\nSquidward: It was SpongeBob's fault! Getting Mr. Krabs a new mattress was his idea!\nPatrick: I knew it!\nPolice Officer: Not so fast!  This card says \"This was all my idea. Love, Squidward.\" If Mr. Krabs doesn't pull through, you're going to jail.\nSquidward: Ooh... you did this, SquarePants! If you don't get Mr. Krabs' mattress back from the dump, I am going to murd...  ... help you do it myself.\nPatrick: Wow, he really does care.\nPatrick: What a dump.\nSpongeBob: We gotta get in there, Squidward. Mr. Krabs is counting on us.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, isn't that the mattress over there?\nSpongeBob: Terrific, Patrick, you found it!\nSquidward: What? Where? Lemme see. Where?\nSpongeBob: Over there, Squidward, underneath that really big guard worm.\nSquidward: Oh, that figures.\nDoctor: Oh no, this is horrible.\nNurse: What is it, doctor?\nDoctor: This man has no insurance.\nNurse: He'll never be able to afford this room!\nDoctor: You're right, nurse. Extract the patient to the hallway. Stat!\nSpongeBob: Well, that's Mr. Krabs' mattress, alright. Let's go get it.\nSquidward: Okay, here's the plan: you two quietly go in there, remove the mattress out from the guard worm without... waking... the worm.\nPatrick: Why not?\nSpongeBob: Because that would be rude, Patrick.\nSquidward: And nothing's meaner than a junkyard worm. He'll eat you alive!\nPatrick: Hey, wait a minute, what are you gonna do?\nSquidward: Oh, I've got the most important job. I'm going to keep watch to make sure it's safe.\nPatrick: Gee, thanks, buddy.\nSquidward: My pleasure. Now let's get a move on.\nSpongeBob: Ah, isn't it beautiful, Patrick? You can see everything from up here.\nPatrick: Wow.\nSquidward: What are you morons doing?\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, I think I can see our houses from here.\nPatrick: Where? I can't see them.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Wow.\nPatrick: Let's do it again.\nSquidward: What did you idiots do?\nPatrick: Squidward, what are you doing in there? You were suppose to keep watch!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, and you woke up the guard worm, too!\nSquidward: I didn't do it! You blockheads woke...  the... worm.\nDoctor #2: Doctor?\nDoctor #1: Yes, doctor?\nDoctor #2: Regarding your patient, doctor. I have come to this conclusion.\nDoctor #1: Yes, go on.\nDoctor #2: We have to surgically remove him out from in front of the candy machine so I can get to the nutty nut bar.\nDoctor #1: Of course. Nurse?\nNurse: I'm on it.\nSpongeBob: Worm-bait to the retriever. Worm bait to the retriever. We're in. Out.\nSquidward: Retriever to worm bait, stay in. Don't go out.\nSpongeBob: Understood. Out.\nSquidward: No! In! Out.\nSpongeBob: Understood. Out.\nSquidward: Oh, look, you're at the far side of the dump, right?\nSpongeBob: Affirmative.\nSquidward: Good. Then make lots of noise to draw the guard worm away from the mattress so I can retrieve it.\nSpongeBob: Affirmative. Out. Oh, that's why he calls himself 'The Retriever'.\nPatrick: Why are we called 'Worm-bait?'\nSpongeBob: I dunno.  Great idea, Patrick!\nSquidward: And my perfect plan falls into place.\nPatrick: Uhh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?\nPatrick: I think I know why our code name is \"Worm-bait\".\nSpongeBob: Nice worm. Good, kind, gentle worm.\nPatrick: Ohh, SpongeBob, he likes your wooden spoon.\nSpongeBob: Wow, I think you're right, Patrick.\nPatrick: See if he plays catch.\nSpongeBob: Okay, see the stick, boy?  Go get it, boy!\nSquidward: Coast is clear. Squiddy, you are a genius.  Ouch. What the...? Hey, I needed a wooden spoon. I'll just keep it safe from harm in my back pocket.  And now for the mattress.  I should've guessed.\nAdministrator Flotsam: Excuse me, doctor.\nDoctor: Administrator Flotsam, what can I do for you?\nAdministrator Flotsam: It has come to my attention that your patient, Mr. Krabs, is outside on the front sidewalk.\nDoctor: Yes, yes he is.\nAdministrator Flotsam: What were you thinking, man? We're trying to run a business. We can't leave patients on the sidewalk.\nDoctor: Not to worry. Nurse!\nNurse: I'm on it.\nSquidward: Alright, you two, what's the holdup?\nSpongeBob: We feel silly.\nSquidward: Come on, do it for old man Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Okay.  Can you explain the plan again, Squidward?\nSquidward: Sure, but first, put on this cologne.\nSpongeBob: Steak sauce?\nSquidward: Okay, so you are dressed as choice cuts. You go in there and yell \"Trick or treat!\" The worm will realize he forgot to stock up on Halloween candy, he'll leave to buy some then we take the mattress.\nPatrick: Gimme that cologne.\nSquidward: Now get in there!\nSpongeBob: Happy Halloween, Squidward!\nSquidward: I am not going to get hurt this time.  Isn't that Mr. Krabs?\nPatrick: That guard worm doesn't look very happy.\nSpongeBob: Run, Mr. Krabs! Run like you're not in a coma!\nMr. Krabs: It's... me money!  Oh, money. I promise I'll never leave you alone again.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs.  No, Mr. Krabs, it's us!\nPatrick: Trick or treat.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, hey, SpongeBob. I didn't recognize you. Say, why are you two dressed as meat?\nSpongeBob: Not just meat, we're choice cuts! Right, Squidward?\nSquidward: Oh, I give up.\n","62b\nKrabs vs. Plankton\nPlankton: And so passes another sleepless night, haunted by my inability to steal even a single Krabby Patty.\nKaren: Maybe today will be the day?\nPlankton: Thank you for your patronizing words, computer wife.\nKaren: Do you even have a plan?\nPlankton: Plan, shman. I'm going to wing it. What's the worst thing that could happen?  I'm in. That was easy. Maybe today is the day I'm going to steal the Krabby Patty formula...\nSpongeBob: Careful, Plankton, I just mopped there.\nMr. Krabs: Look at you, Plankton. Once again, you've fallen flat on your back in a pathetic attempt to steal me formula.  Though you've tried and tried, you haven't had the smallest nibble of my delicious formula.  And you never will!  How do you sleep at night, no wonder you're a complete failure?\nCharlie: There really should be a \"Wet Floor\" sign.\nNat Peterson: Yeah, if that were me who slipped, I'd sue old man Krabs for all he's got.\nPlankton: Does that include the Krabby Patty formula?\nCharlie: Of course.\nPlankton: Oh, the pain! I can't feel my arms and legs! I think they're broken. I'll have to sue for my pain and suffering.\nMr. Krabs: Sue?!\nFemale Customer #1: Oh, that looks bad.\nDennis: Uh-oh.\nNazz: Poor little man.\nMr. Krabs: Wait! Hold up a second! Plankton, we don't need to drag this little incident into court, do we?\nPlankton: Well... if you transfer the Krabby Patty formula to me, I'll forget your gross negligence.\nMr. Krabs: Scoundrel! You'll have me formula when you pry it from me lifeless claws!\nPlankton: See you in court, Krabs! Uh, I mean...  Oh, the pain! The deep-frying pain!\nMr. Krabs: I'm in a blue ruin. I'm doomed!\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I will do whatever it takes to keep the Krusty Krab formula from getting into Plankton's evil hands.\nMr. Krabs: What I really need is a good lawyer.\nRichard: Hello, did somebody say \"lawyer\"?  Richard A. Bottomfeeder, Attorney at Law. I couldn't help but notice that despicable display.\nMr. Krabs: So, uhh, how much is this going to cost me?\nRichard: Actually, I won't charge you a dime unless we win.\nRichard: In fact, I think we should counter sue for everything Plankton owns.\nRichard: Does that happen a lot?\nSpongeBob: No, they're usually silver.\nSpongeBob: Um, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: What is it, lad?\nSpongeBob: I thought you might want to hear my testimony for when you call me as a character witness. I've been rehearsing it.\nMr. Krabs: Actually, SpongeBob, we won't be needing any testimony from you. Why, you'll be more of a...  of a liability than an asset.\nSpongeBob: But I...\nMr. Krabs: Ah, run along. Make things ship-shape for my victory celebration. I've got to get to the courthouse early. There's only a few free parking places.\nRichard: Oh, this is going to be a slam-dunk!\nSpongeBob: Oh no! Mr. Krabs' lawyer! Speak to me!\nRichard: Wracked...with pain...can't move.\nSpongeBob: But what about Mr. Krabs' case?\nRichard: Looks like you're going to have to handle this one, son.\nSpongeBob: But, I'm a...a liability.\nRichard: Everything you need to win...  is in this here case.\nSpongeBob: Really? Everything?\nRichard: Uh huh. Everything but a suit.\nSpongeBob: A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit.\nPlankton: I'll give you one last chance. I'll drop the charges if you give me the formula.\nMr. Krabs: Never, you little runt!\nPlankton: Oww, oww! My wittle arm!\nMr. Krabs: What? No. I didn't lay a claw on him.\nPlankton: Oww! My other arm!\nMr. Krabs: He's lying! Bah!\nTom: Court will come to order. The Honorable Judge Stickleback presiding.\nStickleback: Mr. Krabs, where is your attorney?\nMr. Krabs: I don't know where he could be.\nSpongeBob: Here I am!\nStickleback: Thank you for joining us, Mr...uhh...\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob LawyerPants, your honor.\nMr. Krabs: What are you doing here, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Your lawyer, umm, fell down on the job, but don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I have everything under control. It's uhh, all in here  .\nMr. Krabs: Really?\nSpongeBob: Yep, right in here.\nMr. Krabs: Is there a problem?\nSpongeBob: Umm... your lawyer didn't give me the combination.\nLawyer: Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?\nPlankton: Yes, your honor. I'll try.  I wasn't always the tortured shell of a protozoa that writhes in pain before you today.  I... was a vibrant, carefree, happy-go-lucky, single cell.\nMr. Krabs: Pull yourself together, boy.\nPlankton: Then came the fateful day that I paid an innocent visit to the deathtrap known as the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs: How's it coming, lad?\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'm on the case.\nPlankton: Upon entering said establishment, I found myself without any warning, slipping and finally falling onto a hard, unforgiving floor  that had been intentionally  covered with a viscous fluid.\nSpongeBob: Bombs away!\nPlankton: Ahem! Are you quite finished?\nSpongeBob: Mm-hmm.\nPlankton: Now where was I? Oh yeah. But the worst part is...my dreams of completing a marathon like I promised my old Grammy have been dashed.  I'm...I'm sorry Gram-Gram! Sorry!  Thank you for your kind attention.  Suckers.\nStickleback: Does the defense...  have an opening statement?\nSpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Poor Gram-Gram!\nPlankton: Mr. Krabs, can you identify this item?\nMr. Krabs: It's a \"wet floor\" sign.\nPlankton: Do you own one?\nMr. Krabs: Uhh...well...umm...No, I don't.  No, no! You don't understand! I had to make some tough business decisions and the sign seemed... superfluous.\nCourt Audience: Guilty. Guilty, guilty, guilty.\nPlankton: No more questions.\nStickleback: Your witness, Mr. LawyerPants.\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nStickleback: Sometime today, Mr. Pants.\nSpongeBob: May it please the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My client has been called cheap , miserly and chronically tight-fisted. But, if he were as cheap as the prosecution claims he is, would he be able to sit there quietly, while I took out a dollar  and dropped it in the blender?\nMr. Krabs: No! No-no! No!  Daddy's got ya. Daddy's got ya. Daddy's here.  A little glue, a little tape. It'll be right as rain.  Daddy didn't forget ya.\nStickleback: Does the defense have any witness to call?\nSpongeBob: Yes, your honor. Defense calls Squidward to the stand.\nMr. Krabs: Ahh, Squidward, a loyal employee.\nSpongeBob: Mr., uhh, Squidward, is it? My client has been called cheap. Would you agree with that ludicrous statement?\nSquidward: Yes.\nMr. Krabs: What?!\nSpongeBob: Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?\nSquidward: Nope. Can I go now? One day off in three years and I have to spend it testifying?\nMr. Krabs: Must...open...case.\nSpongeBob: So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it?\nSpongeBob: Answer the question!  Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?\nMr. Krabs: I'm doomed.\nMr. Krabs: You may as well give up on that case, me boy. My goose is cooked.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you! We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.  It's open!\nMr. Krabs: It's...  It's just his lunch. Or is it?\nSpongeBob: Defense calls Plankton to the stand.\nSpongeBob: Why did you go into the Krusty Krab that day?\nPlankton: To, you know. Say hello to my once good friend, Mr. Krabs. What?\nSpongeBob: Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these?  Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini Bottom? Krabby Patty...\nPlankton: Uhh...uhh...uhh  I can't take it! Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!  Yippee! Finally it's mine!\nMr. Krabs: I'll take that!\nPlankton: Huh? No, no, no!\nMr. Krabs: Once again, Plankton, the sweetest of life's joys has eluded your grasp.\nPlankton: No, no, no, no!\nStickleback: Has the jury reached a verdict?\nTom: We have, your honor. We find the defendant not guilty...but he is cheap.\nMr. Krabs: Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning.\nSpongeBob: That's okay, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present.\nMr. Krabs: A present? For me?\nSpongeBob: Close your eyes and hold out your hand.  It's a \"wet floor\" sign. I made it myself.\nMr. Krabs: Well, it'll do. After all, it's free!\n","63\nHave You Seen This Snail?\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.\nPatrick: What are you doing?\nSpongeBob: Carrying this heavy bag of snail food for Gary.\nPatrick: How is Gary?\nSpongeBob: He's fine. Uh, Pat, can we talk about this some other time? This snail food is really heavy.\nPatrick: Oh, sure, but there was something I wanted to tell you...something important. Oh, I remember. Uh...  Who was I talking to?\nSpongeBob: Ahoy, Captain, what have we here? It's a tiny form letter. \"Dear Sir or Ma'am...  We are sorry we missed you. We will attempt to re-deliver your package at our earliest convenience.\"  Hello?  My package. Whoopee!  Oh, let's see what we got here.  My official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy paddleball set. Whoo! Yeah!  What's this? \"Take the Dirty Bubble Challenge! Hit the paddleball 29,998,559,671,349 times in a row.\" Dirty Bubble, wherever you float, I hereby accept your challenge.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Darn it.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Darn it.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: What was that?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry, I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Gary, please! I'm trying to defeat the Dirty Bubble.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble\u2014terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion.  Well, I for one, recognize the importance of this undertaking. But whether or not you do remains to be seen. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to it.  Pets. Sometimes, I wonder if they understand a word you're saying.  Gary, I hate it when you do that! Now get!  And leave your master to his important affairs.  Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers.\nGary: Meow.\nPatrick: I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him.  That's strange... Usually, I knock on the with this hand.  Hey, SpongeBob, you around? SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Darn it.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, is that you?\nSpongeBob: Oh, darn it. Darn it.\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Darn it. Darn it.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, what happened?  This picture is crooked. SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Darn it.\nPatrick: Snap out of it.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I...\nPatrick: What is it, buddy? You can tell me.\nSpongeBob: I took the Dirty Bubble challenge.\nPatrick: You what?!\nSpongeBob: Why are you crying, Patrick?\nPatrick: Because... many years ago, I took that challenge.\nSpongeBob: Really?\nPatrick: Uh-huh.\nSpongeBob: What happened?\nPatrick: I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me.\nSpongeBob: You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and seahorse milk\u2014that always cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat. Fresh seahorse milk.\nPatrick: Thanks, buddy.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important?  Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it\u2014I gotta feed Gary.  That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours.  Gary! Dinner!  Come on, Gary, soup's on.  Gary? Hey, Pat?\nPatrick: Yeah?\nSpongeBob: How long was I taking the Dirty Bubble challenge?\nPatrick: About a week.\nSpongeBob: A week? Are you sure?\nPatrick: Hmmm... well...  Yeah, it's about a week, maybe ten days.\nSpongeBob: Ten days? Gary!  Gary? Gary! Gary? Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Patrick!\nPatrick: Huh?\nSpongeBob: I can't find Gary.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: This never fails. Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of organic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of.\nPatrick: Eight?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Go on, Pat, try it.  Let me see that.  Hmm, I don't understand, this is a brand-new...\nPatrick: I only tasted six types of sediment.\nSpongeBob: Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here?  Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick.\nPatrick: Oh.\nSpongeBob: Gary!\nSquidward: What are those Neanderthals up to? Don't they know I'm busy spoiling myself?\nSpongeBob: You check over there. I'll check in here.  Find him yet, Pat?\nPatrick: No, but I'll keep looking.\nSpongeBob: But there's nowhere left to look.\nPatrick: There's one place we haven't checked.\nSpongeBob: I doubt Gary could fit in there.\nPatrick: Can't hurt to look.\nSpongeBob: Here goes nothing.  Look, Pat!\nPatrick: What is it?\nSpongeBob: Let's see. \"Dear SpongeBob, These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. Don't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food bowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary. At least until my new owner renames me.\" Dear Neptune, what have I done?\nPatrick: What do you mean? You drove him away. It's right there in black and white. See? Right there and there.\nSpongeBob: Gary.\nFred: Are my pants too tight, dear?\nSnail #1: Look who came to dinner.\nSnail #3: Guess he didn't like nachos.\nGramma: There you are.  There you are, Miss Tuffsy. Oh, gramma finally found you. She was starting to get worried. Now let's get to your home, Miss Tuffsy, and get you something to eat. Hmmm.  You feel much lighter than Gramma remembers.  There you go, Miss Tuffsy. Gramma knows you like your Mr. Heaty set to extra cozy when you're home relaxing.\nGary: Mmm.\nGramma: Goodness, you're almost out of cookies. Here, I'll go and get some more. Now, don't you go running off again.  There you go.  After this, I'll go make up some of those deviled eggs I promised.  Oh, how about a little music? Gramma's got a killer stereo system.  Oh, this song reminds Gramma of her days as a riveter.  You make Gramma feel so young. Come on, Miss Tuffsy, let's do the boogie-woogie.  Oh.  Okay, oh, that's enough of the boogie-woogie for now.\nSpongeBob: Gary! Gary? Gary!  Gary!  Gary...!  Oh... Gary!\nGramma: Gramma knows how much you love these late-night crime drama programs. Don't you, Miss Tuffsy? Oh, heavens, look at the time.  It's time for bed, Miss Tuffsy.\nGary: Meow.\nPicture of SpongeBob: Quiet, Gary! Can't you see I'm busy?\nGramma: Here's your room, Miss Tuffsy.\nGary: Meow?\nGramma: Here you are, darling. Let Gramma tuck you in. There you go. Oh,  I almost forgot your good night kiss.  Sweet dreams, Miss Tuffsy.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're 15 minutes late.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, I was out all night looking for Gary. You see, he ran away and, well, now I...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, are you okay? You look kinda...different.\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call okay, Mr. Krabs. You see, my...\nMr. Krabs: Aha! You just forgot to put your hat on.  Knew I'd figure it out.\nSpongeBob: Gary.\nEvelyn: Yeah, I'd like a refund for this Krabby Patty.\nMr. Krabs: Refund?! What's wrong with it?\nEvelyn: Oh, nothing, really... except that it's covered in tears!\nMr. Krabs: What the...?\nSpongeBob: Gary...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! There's customers out there, boy, waiting to be fed!\nSpongeBob: This wouldn't be the first time I disappointed someone who was hungry.\nMr. Krabs: Okay, boy, why don't you tell Mr. Krabs what's wrong.\nSpongeBob: Well, you see...\nMr. Krabs: That's enough, boy. See, it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes, it's what you don't say. Understand?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me.\nMr. Krabs: Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work.\nSpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: That's me boy!\nSpongeBob: If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it.\nMr. Krabs: Wh...?\nPatrick: It's the apocalypse! Office products falling from the sky!\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. We're going to use this stuff to go find Gary.\nPatrick: But I thought you drove him away with your neglect and indifference.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, now is not the time for talking. We've got work to do.\nGramma: There you go, Miss Tuffsy\u2014fresh squeezed. It takes longer to make it that way, but it was a labor of love.\nGary: Meow.\nGramma: How about a little more syrup on those pancakes?  Here comes the train. Hoo-hoo!  Set phasers on fun, Miss Tuffsy.  Oh, here we are.\nSpongeBob: Here's a good spot.  \"Gary! I am sorry! Please come home! Love, SpongeBob\". Quick, hand me the tape.\nPatrick: Hey, they're having a sale on scented pine cones.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, this is no time for that.\nPatrick: Pine cones, pine cones, pine cones.\nGramma: These pipe cleaners are simply delightful.\nPatrick: Old lady, quick. I'm looking for the scented pine cones. It's an emergency!\nGramma: Well, I hope you weren't looking to buy them, sonny, because Gramma already picked up all they had.\nPatrick: Once again, you and I are kept apart, oh sweet scented pine cones. Hey, Gary.\nSpongeBob: There.\nPatrick: When Patrick comes out, the posters on the door are torn in half Um...uhh...\nSpongeBob: Come on, Pat, just take these fliers and hand them out.\nGramma: Come on, Miss Tuffsy, there's plenty more fun to be had.\n\u266aGary, now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you. Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary. Gary, come home. Gary, can't you see I was blind, I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet, you're my best friend, too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word poem: Gary, come home!\u266a\nPatrick: I want peanuts.\nSpongeBob: Pat, no!\nMable: Who is this 'Lisa' person?\nLenny: What?\nGramma: Gramma will get a lovely meat loaf in the oven for you.\nGary: Meow.\nGramma: Don't worry, it's no trouble at all. Easy to do.\nGary: Meow.\nGramma: Oh, Miss Tuffsy, do you have to go potty? Here, why don't you use this stack of fliers given to me today by a little chubby boy.\nSpongeBob: Gary, please come back to me! Go, boy, go!\nGramma: You stay right there. The meatloaf is almost done.  Oh, dear. The meatloaf is not quite ready yet, but Gramma knows how hungry you are, Miss Tuffsy, so she whipped up a quick batch of cookies.\nSnails in picture: Run!\nGramma: You don't want cookies? Don't fret, I made a batch of deviled eggs, too.  Come back, Miss Tuffsy. You don't want these to go to waste, do you? They were a labor of love.  Oh, don't worry, Miss Tuffsy, Gramma will find you.\nSnail #3: Hey! You're the guy that doesn't like nachos.\nGramma: Miss Tuffsy, I know you're back there, I can't hear your stomach growling.\nSnail #3: Hey!\nGramma: Oh, there you are, Miss Tuffsy.\nSnail #3: Who?\nGramma: You must be starving.\nPatrick: Just let it out, buddy. That's right.\nSpongeBob: I can't cry anymore, Patrick. When Gary left, he took all my tears with him.\nPatrick: Did you just say Gary? SpongeBob, I just remembered earlier today at the craft store, I saw... these huge chunks of balsa wood!  They were awesome!\nSpongeBob: Gary loves balsa wood!  I got to try to forget Gary. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind.  I blew it, I really blew it. I took you for granted, Gary. I'm sorry! Don't just stare at me, say something! I'm talking to a billboard.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Now I'm hearing things. If only I could see you one more time so I could tell you how much I love you. If only I could hear you meow one last time.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, like that.  Gary, your purring is making it hard to forget you... GARY! Oh, Gary!  So, did you hear any of that, or do I have to repeat myself?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Okay, good. I promise, Gary, things are going to be different between you and I. You'll see, pal. Now let's go home and get you something to eat. You must be starving.\nGary: Meow.\n","64a\nSkill Crane\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, some guy in a suit wants to come in before we open.\nMr. Krabs: What?

Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?\nSpongeBob: Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out.

Free Installation\"\nSecurity System: System Activated.\nSquidward: That oughta do it. Let's see those imbeciles try to get in here now.\nSpongeBob: President Squidward?\nSquidward: What the\u2026?!\nSpongeBob: We hereby present you with this delicious cake.\nSquidward: \"Sorry for bugging you so much\"?

Code red!\nSpongeBob: It's like a carnival ride.\nSquidward: Run for your lives!  What the? What are you doing?! I only have half an hour of me time left, and the idiots took my house. Which means those boobs aren't around to bug me. Ooh, just what I've been waiting for.  I am gonna relax if it kills me.\nArmy: Fire!\nPatrick: Wow. Squidward's house is destroying the neighborhood.\nSpongeBob: We gotta turn this thing off.  Nope, not it.\nPatrick: Nope.\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nPatrick: That's not it, either.\nSquidward: This Sunday relaxation really hits the spot.\nSpongeBob: Hmmm, where to look.  Hmmm, this off button seems suspicious.  We did it, Patrick!  President Squidward?\nSquidward: No-no, don't say anything more. This was all my fault. I was the one who wanted to relax on Sunday. Now if you'll be so kind to leave so I can get ready for work tomorrow.\nSpongeBob: Mr. President-\nSquidward: Shush.\nSpongeBob: But we just wanted to\u2026\nSquidward: Get out of my house! Huh?\nScooter: There he is!\nGreen Fish: Are you the owner of this house?\nSquidward: Yes! Yes, I am!\nGreen Fish: Then on behalf of the citizens of Bikini Bottom,  I present you with this summons to pay for the destruction of our town. You'll be doing community service every Sunday for the rest of your life.\nSquidward: Huh?\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, you got one of those, too?  This'll be great. The three of us cleaning up Bikini Bottom. Well, see ya next Sunday, president Squidward.\n","65a\nSelling Out\nMr. Krabs: Here they come, lads!\nSpongeBob: Hooray!\nSquidward: Fantastic.\nMr. Krabs: Thank you very much, madam.  I feel so alive! \u266aCha ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. Money, oh money, how I love thee. Cha-ching. Cha-chong. Cha-changaroo. From pennies to dollars. Any amount will do. Cha-ching. Cha-ching. It's no contest. There's only one thing that I love the best from every sight I ever seen, to sweetest sound I've heard. I'd gladly give up everything for all the money that I've earned! Cha-ching. Cha-ching. Cha-chingaring. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed. There's nothing on Earth like the feeling of greed!\u266a\nSquidward: Please don't do that again.\nHoward: I think the stain glass barstool can go over here. And the suede hand carved wooden sports flag display case can go over there.\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy there, matey. Can I help you gentlemen with something?\nHoward: I'd like to speak to the owner.\nMr. Krabs: Who wants to know?\nHoward: Allow me to introduce myself. Howard Blandy: President of the Blandy Franchising Company.\nMr. Krabs: Howard Blandy? You mean the Howard Blandy? The Howard Blandy that masterminded the ruthless takeover of every small family owned business in Bikini Bottom? That Howard Blandy?  I worship you.\nHoward: Get it together, little man.\nMr. Krabs: Sorry, it's just you're rich.  I'm Mr. Krabs. To what do I owe the honor of having you at the Krusty Krab, Howard?\nHoward: What would it take to buy the Krusty Krab from you?\nMr. Krabs: Buy the Krusty Krab? It's not for sale. You know, I may not make as much as your fancy-schmancy-migger restaurant chain, but it's the blood, sweat, and tears of a hard days work. It's not about the mon...  Holy sweet mother of pearl! I like the way you think, Blandy. But it's gonna take a lot more than a suitcase of cash to buy the Krusty Krab from me.\nHoward: Oh, there's a lot more than that. The rest is over there.\nMr. Krabs: Jumpin' King Neptune!  Sold. Can I have my money?\nHoward: Just one thing. If you can sign this contract. It just states that you relinquish the Krusty Krab and all proprietary ownership thereof. Along with its employees, merchandise, logos, and cash registers.\nMr. Krabs: Do I still get the money?\nHoward: Of course.\nMr. Krabs: That'll be fine then.  Here you go. Now gimme gimme gimme gimme.  Whoo-ha! See ya around.\nSpongeBob: What's happening? Mr Krabs! Mr Krabs, they're putting up pennants in the Krusty Krab. What's going on?\nMr. Krabs: I'm retiring!\nSpongeBob: Retiring?\nMr. Krabs: I'm free to do whatever I want. I can learn to ride that bicycle I got 30 years ago. Or go to the new hook museum downtown. Or even paint bowls of fruit. Aren't you happy for me?\nSpongeBob: I sure am.\nMr. Krabs: So long, boys.\nSpongeBob: Have fun, Mr. Krabs.\nSquidward: Heaven knows I won't.\nCarl: Hi, gentlemen, I'm Carl. I'll be your new manager.\nSpongeBob: New manager?\nCarl: I think you'll find working at the Krabby O'Monday\u2019s to be a both learning experience and enjoyable one.\nSpongeBob: Krabby O'Monday\u2019s?\nCarl: You won't be needing these anymore.  Now here are your new uniforms and here are the...  employee manuals. See ya first thing tomorrow.\nMr. Krabs: Ahh, the sweet smell of a brand-new day. First stop: the new hook museum. And then maybe I'll...  Hey, the Krabby O'Monday\u2019s? Not the name I would've chosen. But that's all behind me now.  Wait a minute. I hate golf!  Well, I've done everything I wanted to do. And it's not even noon.\nPearl: Did you see the shoes she has on? So last year.  Hold on, Gina. Yeah, Dad?\nMr. Krabs: How's it going?\nPearl: Fine.\nMr. Krabs: Whatcha up to?\nPearl: I'm talking on the phone!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, really?\nPearl: Really.\nMr. Krabs: Oh.\nPearl: Dad, isn't there something you need to do?\nMr. Krabs: Actually, I was hoping you and I could do something together.\nPearl: Get out! That's it, Dad. Get a job, get a hobby, or get some friends. Because I can't take it anymore!\nMr. Krabs: Find some friends she says, find a hobby she says, get a job she says...  Help wanted.\nSquidward: Ahoy there, mateys. Welcome to Krabby O'Monday\u2019s.\nTyler: It's my birthday.\nSquidward: Can I start you off with...\nMother: Will you sing the Krabby O'Monday\u2019s birthday song to my special little man?\nSquidward: Happy, happy birthday.  Happy, happy bir...\nCarl: Uhh, Squidward, can I talk to you for a second? What's our motto here at Krabby O'Monday\u2019s?\nSquidward: Sincere service with a smile.\nCarl: Well, yes, but with the Krabby O'Monday\u2019s spirit. Now, Squidward, you wouldn't want to have to talk to human resources...  ...would you? So, what's our motto again?\nSquidward: Sincere service  with a smile.\nCarl: Now you're gettin' it.\nMr. Krabs: Morning, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! What are you doing here?\nMr. Krabs: Retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. So, I'm the new bus boy.  Uhh, okay, son. You're starting to creep my out.\nSpongeBob: I knew you'd come back, Mr. Krabs, I just knew you would.\nMr. Krabs: Okay, boy, back to work.\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.\nMr. Krabs: I'm not your boss anymore. Just call me Eugene.\nSpongeBob: Aye aye... Eugene.\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy, Squidward.\nSquidward: Ahoy, Eugene! Would you mind clearing this table for me?\nMr. Krabs: Sure, Squidward. Ya know, I've never seen you this happy.\nSquidward: They're watching us.\nMr. Krabs: That guy's a real pain in the hindquarters, eh Squiddy?\nSquidward: Uhh, Eugene, I think you need to look at page 20 of our employee handbook again.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I don't need Carl's silly rules.\nSquidward: I really think you should look.\nMr. Krabs: What's this? Help me.\nCarl: Hey, fellas,  what's going on over here?\nSquidward: Oh, hey, Carl, uhh, I was just reminding Eugene about article 24 section 3 of our employee handbook.\nCarl: Cut the chatter, and pick up the platter.  Good job, Squidward.\nMr. Krabs: What have you done to the real Squidward?\nCarl: The less you know, Eugene, the better.\nMr. Krabs: What's going on around here? Where's SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Where's the love?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what happened to the Krabby Patties?\nSpongeBob: I tried to tell them... but they wouldn't listen to me!\nMr. Krabs: This is obscene.  Carl, I need to have a wor...\nCash Register: Your change is $1.75.\nMr. Krabs: Automated cash register? Noo!  Hey, Carl, what have you done to me restaurant? Processed Krabby Patties? Computerized registers?\nCarl: Look around you. Our customers are quite content with the contrived and the mediocre.\nMr. Krabs: That's because they don't know what they're eating.  Excuse me, ma'am, do you know what's in that Krabby Patty you're eating?\nMartha Smith: No.\nMr. Krabs: See that? Without all your smoke & mirrors, no one would stomach this garbage.\nFrank: What'd he say? Garbage?\nCarl: Eugene, you're in violation of your contract.\nMr. Krabs: Rules! Here's a rule for ya: people can't eat stain glass barstools!  I'll show you automated!\nCarl: Mr. Blandy? Code red! Free thinker!\nHoward: Mr. Krabs, is there a problem here?\nMr. Krabs: You better believe there's a problem! I used to kiss the ground you walked on, Blandy! But after seeing this, I wouldn't even spit in your direction! Krabby Patties are supposed to be made by hand, one at a time! Not on a conveyor belt!\nCarl: Oh, my.  Does this mean I won't get that raise, sir?\nHoward: It's ruined!\nFriend: We'll have to sell it. We'll be lucky if we get a fraction of what we paid for it.\nMr. Krabs: I'll buy it for full price.\nFriend: Sold. We won't be needing your contract anymore.  Nice doing business with you.\nMr. Krabs: Pleasure's all mine. Now get out of me restaurant.  Well, we did it, boys.  The Krusty Krab is ours again. Ya know, in a fit of maniacal rage, I may have destroyed the restaurant, scared away all our customers, and forced us into bankruptcy because I returned nearly every penny I sold this stink heap for, but it was all worth it. And I got back the love of my dear friends.\nSquidward: Really, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: No, not really. Get back to work!\n","65b\nFunny Pants\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward!\nSquidward: What do you want, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Time for work, Squidward. Another day, another dollar.\nSquidward: More like another nickel.\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squidward!  Another day, another nickel.\nSquidward: It's not that funny.\nSpongeBob: It's funny, because it's true!\nSquidward: Move over.\nSpongeBob: Nickel.\nSquidward: Here's your food.  It's not that funny!  Please make it stop!\nSpongeBob: Ok, Squidward, see ya tomorrow.\nCustomer #1: And always check for spare change.\nSpongeBob: Another day, another...nickel!  2 Krabby Patties.\nCustomer #2: Thanks, kid.\nSpongeBob: Another day, another nickel.\nCustomer #2: Oh.\nSquidward: He's gone laughing tormentor.  This could be my chance.  SpongeBob, you don't look well!\nSpongeBob: I don't?\nSquidward: No. You should sit down.\nSpongeBob: But...\nSquidward: Shh, shh, shh.  You're burning up, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: I am?\nSquidward: Tell me, SpongeBob, have your sides been hurting?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, a little.\nSquidward: And your temperature is 175 degrees!\nSpongeBob: It's that bad?\nSquidward: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unless you've been doing a lot of laughing.\nSpongeBob: I have been laughing a lot, lately.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you've got to be careful! You're gonna burn out your laugh box.\nSpongeBob: My laugh box?\nSquidward: Yes, it's the part of your body that enables laughter. If you use it too long without giving it a break, it burns out and you can never laugh again.\nSpongeBob: Is that what happened to you, Squidward?\nSquidward: Yes. What? No! Listen, SpongeBob, this is serious. If you burn your laugh box you live your whole life without ever laughing again.\nSandy: Hey, Patrick, you wanna hear a joke?\nPatrick: Sure, Sandy.\nSpongeBob: Sure, I'd love a good laugh.\nSandy: What has four wheels and flies? A garbage truck!\nSpongeBob: I don't wanna burn out my laugh box, Squidward.\nSquidward: Well, the most important thing is to stop laughing. Any laugh at all could be dangerous.\nSpongeBob: How long do I have to avoid laughing?\nSquidward: Gosh, SpongeBob, I'd say at least for the rest of the day. But you better go 24 hours just to be safe.\nSpongeBob: Thank you so much, Squidward! I don't know what I'd do without you!  A day without laughter is a small price to pay to save my laugh box from utter destruction. I must remain vigilant.  Nothing funny over there.  Nothing funny over here.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, how's it going?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, banana peel, don't!\nPatrick: What'd you say?\nSpongeBob: Oh, no.\nPatrick: Hey, what the...\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick!  Please stop!\nPatrick: Right foot first...\nSpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, I can't laugh.\nPatrick: You can't? Oh, I know what to do!  That usually knocks him out.\nSpongeBob: Get a grip on yourself, SpongeBob. You're in control.  Just back away from the whoopee cushion, SpongeBob.  They're everywhere. Everywhere!\nDelivery Fish: Look out for that pie truck!\nSpongeBob: I gotta get outta here.  There's nothing funny up here. But just to be safe...  Ah, I made it 24 hours without laughing.  That's odd.  I've lost my laugh.  I've lost my laugh!\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: It's terrible, Patrick. I can't laugh anymore!\nPatrick: What happened?\nSpongeBob: I went a whole day without laughing and now my laugh is gone.\nPatrick: Let me take a look.  Hmmm, it's dark in here. I better light a match.\nMr. Krabs: Come in.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: What's wrong, boy?\nSpongeBob: I lost my laugh.\nMr. Krabs: You've come to the right place, son. Ya know, there's one thing that always makes me laugh.  Don't it just tickle you, boy?\nSpongeBob: Not really.\nMr. Krabs: This calls for drastic measures. I don't usually do this but you seem desperate. touch it.\nSpongeBob: Nothing.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, this is worse than I thought. After all, money is the ultimate source of joy.\nSpongeBob: Maybe I should ask Sandy. She's a scientist.\nSandy: Oh, it's easy if you approach it scientifically, SpongeBob. Now, what is laughter?\nSpongeBob: The thing that used to give my life meaning and purpose, but now mocks me with its cruel indifference.\nSandy: But scientifically speaking, it's caused by your epiglottis constricting your larynx causing irregular air intake and respiratory upset.\nSpongeBob: Sounds painful.\nSandy: Science makes everything sound painful, SpongeBob.  Now, here's a humor theory textbook, laugh mechanics, and the quantum giggle theory.\nSpongeBob: Thank you, Sandy.\nSquidward: Ah, it sure is peaceful around here since SquarePants became a sad sack.\nSpongeBob: I read all the books and still nothing. I guess I'll never laugh again.\nSquidward: I really hate to see the little guy sad but not as much as I hate to see him happy.\nNarrator: Later that same evening...\nSquidward: I think I found the one thing I hate more than his laugh. I'm sure he'll cry himself out soon.  What have I done?  Oh, that's it! This charade has to end.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, this infernal crying has to stop.\nSpongeBob: But Squidward, I...I broke my laugh box!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, there's no such thing as a laugh box! I made the whole thing up to get some peace from your insipid laughter!\nSpongeBob: You mean...my laugh box isn't broken and it was a cruel lie that sent me into spiral depression.\nSquidward: (taken aback by the revelation) Uhh, well it sounds pretty harsh when you put it that way, but yes.\nSpongeBob: I could laugh the whole time?\nSquidward: Yeah.  You really fell for it.\nSpongeBob: I guess I did.\nSquidward: You even fell for the ol' thermometer in the boiling oil routine.\nSpongeBob: It's really not that funny, Squidward.\nSquidward: It's hilarious!\nSpongeBob: See ya later, Squidward.\nSquidward: Break your laugh box! What a schlemiel.  yahhhh!\nPatrick: Look, he's waking up.\nSquidward: (groans) Where am I?\nSandy: You're in the hospital, silly. You broke your laugh box.\nMr. Krabs: The doctor said it was the most tiny, dried-out, underused laugh box he ever laid eyes on.\nPatrick: So they cut it out.\nSquidward: Cut it out?!\nPatrick: Yeah, wanna see it?  It's fun to shake it up and watch it bounce around.\nSquidward: Gimme! Oh. I can never laugh again?\nDoctor: Nonsense. Your laugh should be stronger than ever.\nSquidward: But, you cut out my laugh box.\nDoctor: Yes, but uhh, one of your friends generously allowed us to transplant part of theirs to you.\nPatrick: Nope.\nMr. Krabs: They wouldn't pay me.\nSandy: You're getting warmer.\nSquidward: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Hey, you laugh just like me.  Ah, there he goes off to share his laugh with the world.\n","66\nDunces and Dragons\nSpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, it's almost time for the joust.\nPatrick: Right behind ya, SpongeBob.\nSpeaker: Welcome to Medieval Moments. You're just 20 wizard's paces away from swords, sorcery and bad hygiene.\nHenchman: Right this way, please.\nSpongeBob: Excuse me, my good man, I believe thou meant to say \"Righteth this wayeth\".\nHenchman: Some day but not today.\nSpongeBob: How's that mutton, Patrick?\nPatrick: Methinks it's mutton-tastic.\nMedieval Queen: Morrie, you're suppose to announce the jousting tournament!\nMedieval King: Good evening, fair patrons of Medieval Moments. By royal decree, we ask that two audience members come forth and participate in the, uhh, royal joust.  Oh, alright. It appears that the pink starfish and the yellow sponge are our lucky contestants tonight. Hoorah.\nSpongeBob: Isn't this exciting, Patrick? To think, we'll be watching the joust this close up.\nRoyal Henchman: You won't be watching the joust, you're in the joust.\nSpongeBob: Pat, do you know how to ride a seahorse?\nPatrick: Nuh-uh.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Seahorse, sir, you're gentle on beginners, aren't you?\nPatrick: SpongeBob, help!\nCrowd: Take his head off!\nSpongeBob: I don't suppose now would be a good time to ask for a bathroom break!  Patrick!\nPatrick: Glad that's over.\nSpongeBob: Look, some employees from the restaurant came to help us.\nHorseman: Arrest these traitors for committing the act of witchcraft by falling from the sky.\nSpongeBob: Whoa, they really go that extra mile for authenticity. Salutations fellow knights.\nHorseman: Silence, heathen!\nSpongeBob: Ah! I get the point.\nDungeon Master: Nighty night, ladies. You'll have many more in here.\nSpongeBob: Gee, Pat, these props sure are convincing.\nSquidly: Oh, blast this confounded instrument. If I never play with ease, may my own great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandson be cursed ten-fold.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, what are you doing here?\nSquidly: Dost thou talketh to me?\nSpongeBob: Good one, Squidward.  \"Dost thou talketh to me?\"\nSquidly: Scoff not, young squire. Thou hast mistaken me for another. I am Squidly, the king's royal fool. Or at least I was until I royally messed up.\nSpongeBob: Wow, what'd you do?\nSquidly: I'll show you. \u266aI was the king's favorite fool. I made merry mirth and laughter. Then I told one bad joke and the king had a stroke, now I hang from ye olde rafter.\u266a\nPatrick: What does a guy have to do get some mutton around here? I'm starving!\nSquidly: Don't hold thy breath! We'll be lucky if we get fed again by the 12th century!\nSpongeBob: They sure do take their role-playing seriously around here.\nPatrick: What's that?\nSquidly: \u266aThe evil wizard's dragon is here. See the townsfolk scream with fear. See the townsfolk try to run. I can tell this won't be fun. The dragon will torch everything. Everything in the valley. Hospitals, schools, retirement homes, and even ye olde bowling alley.\u266a\nCitizen: Not the bowling alley!\nSpongeBob: Knights, jesters, dragons, medieval bowling alleys, 12th century? Don't you see, Patrick? We really are in medieval times!\nPatrick: Oh no, I think I left the water running at home!\nDungeon Master: The king wants a word with you two.\nPatrick: Yay!\nSpongeBob: Wait, we don't leave without Squidly.\nDungeon Master: Why should I take him?\nSpongeBob: Because, umm, Squidly has thought of some brilliant songs for the king and he just has to hear them. Isn't that right, Squidly?\nSquidly: Absolutely.\nSpongeBob: Squidly, uhh, maybe you should wait for the king to hear that.\nSquidly: Suit thineselves. Thou dost not knowest what thou art missing.\nKing: Woe is me. Woe is me. Woe is me. What to do? What to do?\nPearl: Father, what art thou going on about now?\nKing: Oh, just the same ol' thing dear daughter. It's that wretched wizard Planktonamor. His insidious dragon's destroyed half the kingdom. Soon, there'll be no citizens to tax. Not one of me best knights have been able to defeat him.\nPearl: Father, remember your blood pressure. You wouldn't want another leech treatment, would you?\nLeech: Meow.\nHenchman: Your highness, the dungeon master has brought the prisoners you asked for.\nKing: Well don't just stand there, send 'em in.\nHenchman: Sure thing, your highnessssssssss.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs.\nKing: How dare you bark at me in that tone, knave! I am the feared ruler of this kingdom and will be addressed as such.\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\nKing: And why have you brought this fool back into me throne room?\nSquidly: If your majesty may be so kind, I think I have a song that will answer all your questions.\nKing: Ohh, alright, alright. But this is your last chance, fool.\nSquidly: Oh, thank you sir. Thank you. You won't be disappointed. \u266aOh hear me king for I must sing, how you are the greatest at everything. Like letting a dragon burn down our city, a horrible sight that wasn't pretty. 'Twas all your fault and 'tis a pity, you are bad, you are to blame, now hang your kingly head in shame.  La la la la la la la la la la la!\u266a\nSquidly, SpongeBob, and Patrick: \u266aThe king is bad, the king's to blame, he hangs his kingly head in shame. La la la la la la la la la la la!\u266a\nKing: Guards, send these slanderers to the guillotine.\nSpongeBob: Wait, you don't understand. We're not from here.\nKing: That's because you're witches who were sent by Planktonamor to destroy me.\nSpongeBob: No, we're time travelers.  Help me out here, Patrick.\nPatrick: I'm not sure that there's anything I can add at this point.\nKing: Ok, I'm through playing around. Guards!\nPearl: Father, you must spare them. Hast thou forgotten about the prophecy.\nKing: What prophecy?\nPearl: The one right above your head.\nKing: How long has that been there?\nPearl: The story tells of two brave knights who fall from the sky, and are sent by the king to rid the lamenting town of the evil dragon controlled by the one-eyed wizard. Father, don't you get it? It's them. These strangers have come to rescue us, like in the prophecy.\nKing: How dare you defile my house, demon!  Princess Pearl! I'm coming, Pearl. Prepare to meet thy maker, foul beast.\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess this is it, Patrick.\nPatrick: I guess so. I'm gonna miss you, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: I'll miss you, too, buddy.\nPearl: Daddy, help!\nKing: Pearl!  Can no one stop this madness?  You two, my apologies.  Most noble and valiant warriors.\nPatrick: I guess this is what you call the royal treatment.\nKing: May Neptune grant you safety on your perilous journey to the evil wizard's castle to which no one has escaped alive.\nSpongeBob: We're going on a perilous journey?\nKing: Well, of course, you're the chosen ones. Huh, what's this? A lost piece of the prophecy? Hmmm\u2026\nSpongeBob: Lemme guess, more praise for our heroic stature?\nKing: Actually, it says I'm supposed to kick you out of here.\nSpongeBob: Say no more, Your Majesty. Us manly knights are so manly, we kick ourselves out of places. Come on, Patrick!\nPatrick: Look out trouble!\nSquidly: Well, so much for their company.\nKing: On second thought, you better go with 'em. They could use the entertainment.\nSquidly: Have it your way.\nKing: Good luck, strange ones!\nSpongeBob: I know we're a prophecy and all, but I don't think we can stop the dragon with our bare hands.\nPatrick: Yeah, we need some gloves.\nSquidly: Perhaps yonder blacksmith can provide some arms for your battle.\nSpongeBob: At last, an honest man of the soil. Observe, as a I effortlessly commingle with this brutish native.  Greetings, iron man. I am Sir SpongeBob of Bikini\u2026  ...Bottom.\nBlacksmith: I told you people before, I'd have the rent when I have it.\nSpongeBob: We just wanted to buy some armor.\nBlacksmith: Well, why didn't you just say that?  Hmmm, I've got just the thing for you.\nPatrick: This is awesome.  Hey, SpongeBob, get out here!  Whoa, SpongeBob, you look incredible.\nBlacksmith: And now for the piece de resistance.  Your sword, brave knight. Hand-forged from anodized dragon's skin. It is truly a weapon worthy of a knight of your stature.\nSpongeBob: A little heavy, isn't it?\nBlacksmith: That's gonna need some stitches. Let me see what I else I got.  Unfortunately, all I have in the way of light weaponry is this jellyfish net.\nSpongeBob: That's perfect!\nSquidly: We doth have a long journey ahead of us.\nSpongeBob: It's a good thing I packed us a lunch of delicious Krabby Patties.\nPatrick: Ooh!\nLord Planktonamor: This be the legendary prophecy?  Oh, that be-eth rich. 'Twould almost insult me were it not so funny.\nKaren the Crystal Ball: Planktonamor, thou art cocky and overly confident with thyself.\nLord Planktonamor: Trusteth in me, Karen. I doth knowest what I am doing. Come hither, boy.  Deliver my demands onto his majesty, King Krabs.\nDark Knight: Halt, who goes there?\nSquidly: Doth my eyes betray me? 'Tis the nefarious dark knight. \u266aOh, dark knight, spare us please, don't cut off our heads or boil our knees. Pray take these two and let me go free and I will give to thee some...cheese!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Dark knight?!\nDark Knight: I asketh once more. Before I rip thee limb from limb, reveal thyself!\nSpongeBob: I am SpongeBob and this is Patrick.  We've been sent to rescue Princess Pearl from Planktonamor.\nDark Knight: If thou wishes to get across, thou willst have  to get through me!\nSpongeBob: Medieval Sandy! I know how to handle this: With a little karate!\nDark Knight: By the hammer of Odin, this be a new fighting style my eyes have not yet seen.\nSpongeBob: I am bad, oh yeah! Whoo!\nDark Knight: Doth thou tryeth to insult me? Thou willst drink from the fountain of shame!\nSpongeBob: Pssh, did you hear that, Patrick? I told you she thinks like a squirrel.  Good one, Medieval Sandy. But can you handle my feet of fury?\nDark Knight: Wouldst thou like a little rub down?  You have bested me, yellow knight... Strike quick and true, noble sponge...\nSpongeBob: I don't understand a word you just said!  Uhh, Medieval Sandy, you don't look so good. Sandy? Sandy\u2026?  Patrick, it's working. Do it again.\nDark Knight: Thou hath spared me, kind and noble sponge. And unto thee, I owe a debt of gratitude, for I will follow you on your quest to defeat Planktonamor and learn a trifle of that karate.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, karate!\nSquidly: Oweth.\nHenchman: Your Majesty! Your Majesty! A scroll hath arrived for thee.\nKing Krabs: Thou must hand over thy village and thy throne or thy daughter shall be dipped into a cauldron of lava?! Pearl!\nSquidly: That be the shriek of the fair Princess. \u266aHark, the Princess, she screams from the tower, by the sound of her shrieks this is her final hour.\u266a\nDark Knight: Then time be of the essence. Doth we all remember thy plan?\nPatrick: No, uhh, I mean yes. Yes! That's what I said, heh. Yes.\nDark Knight: Then let us forge on. Make way, heathens. Dark Knight coming through.\nGuard: State thy business, Dark Knight.\nDark Knight: These village idiots are conspirators against Master Planktonamor and I needeth know which form of torture thy master wishes upon these wretched fools. Do I have their limbs tied to horses and swiftly yanked apart? Rip! Or pluck each individual eyelash one by one, taking away their every single last eyelash wish!\nGuard: Very well, Dark Knight. Entrance be granted.  Halt! Make a wish.\nDark Knight: Wow, goodsome thinking, Sir SpongeBob. Posing as a frightened wee babe in ye ol' diapers did make it most believable.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, you think we fooled them?  Wait, that's Pearl. I must fulfill the prophecy while you untie Patrick and the royal doofus.\nSquidly: That be royal fool.\nSpongeBob: Hang on, Pearl, we're coming to rescue you!  We're a-comin'. Almost there. Oh, dear Neptune.\nLord Planktonamor: Soon, the King's village will be mine, mine, mine!\nSpongeBob: Unhand her, you fiend!\nPearl: The prophecy is nigh!\nSpongeBob: We're here to rescue you, Pearl. Whew! Can I get a glass of water?\nLord Planktonamor: Sparkling or regular?  Psycheth!\nSpongeBob: You truly are the nastiest wizard in all of Bikini Bottomshire. Prepare to be vanquished.\nLord Planktonamor: Bring it oneth, knave.\nSpongeBob: What the\u2026? Where\u2026? Oh\u2026  I didn't see you. You're so tiny.  That tickles! Tiny powers! Tiny powers!\nPearl: I be-eth ok.\nLord Planktonamor: Wow\u2026 huh?  Yes! Yes! Sicketh them boy!\nSquidly: Perhaps a soothing limerick will calm thee. \u266aThere once was a dragon so handsome and smart, he let me go free for he had a big heart.\u266a  Everyone be-eth a critic.\nDark Knight: Hi-ya!\nPatrick: No! No! No!\nLord Planktonamor: Dead end for you, simpleton.\nSpongeBob: Wait a second.  Wow, the boys back home will never believe this.\nPatrick: I'm right here and I don't believe it.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: No! No! No! No!\nSpongeBob: Well, I guess this is it, Pat.\nPatrick: Yeah. Hey, can we eat those Krabby Patties now?\nSpongeBob: Sure, buddy.\nPatrick: Yay!  Hey!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, look! He's eating the Krabby Patty.\nPatrick: Huh? No! No! No-o-o! The horror. The horror.\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, it's a good thing.\nPatrick: It is?\nSpongeBob: Sure it is. Just listen to him purr. He loves that Krabby Patty.\nLord Planktonamor: Forsooth. What be-eth going on here? Destroy them! Do it now or so help me.\nSpongeBob: Umm, I'd be more than happy to make you some more of those delicious Krabby Patties.\nLord Planktonamor: Curses. You win.\nSquidly: Make way. Thy king's heroes cometh through. \u266aHark! Ring the bell, 'tis all ended well! The dragon is vanquished, the princess returned, and only a few of us got badly burned!\u266a\nKing: Order up!  Hmmm, I doth wonder if I could sell these, uhh, Krabby Patties.\nCitizen: Not that horrible noise.\nCitizen #2: Make it stop!\nMedieval Queen: Hey, kid, are you okay? That was some fall you had.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I guess I shouldn't have agitated that seahorse. That was some dream, huh, Patrick? Patrick?\nPatrick: Try telling that to Squidly.\n","67a\nEnemy In-Law\nPlankton: Oh, good, the lunch rush. Now that my ChumBot has dropped you into my clutches, you'll be forced to eat at the Chum Bucket.\nNat: What?! You mean you kidnapped us just to sell us your fast food?\nPlankton: C'mon, it's a standard marketing technique.\nNat: You little twerp.\nPlankton: Hey!\nKaren: He's right, ya know.\nPlankton: Karen?! You think I'm a twerp?\nKaren: Well, yes, but I was referring to the kidnapping.\nPlankton: Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.\nKaren: Maybe it's because you are always wrong.\nPlankton: Fine, I'm wrong and you're right.\nKaren: You said it, not me.\nPlankton: Why did I ever install that nagging software?\nKaren: Nagging software? I heard that! Come back and dust my screen!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, money. You're always there for me.\nMama Krabs: Hello, Eugene.\nMr. Krabs: Mother! Uh, what brings ya by today?\nMama Krabs: I just wanted to see my favorite son.\nMr. Krabs: How much of my money do you want?\nMama Krabs: Well, I did see the prettiest hat in town today.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye!  Whew, that was a close one.\nPlankton: Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman - not a girl in a cold-hearted shell.  Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.\nKaren: Plankton! You've fallen in love with another woman?! I'm your wife!\nPlankton: You're a W.I.F.E.. Wired Integratred Female Electroencephlagraph.\nKaren: Oh, you always pull that one out! \"You're not a real wife, you're just a computer!\"\nPlankton: Why don't you have an 'off' switch?\nKaren: Plankton, don't you dare...\nPlankton: And now to woo that beloved creature.\nRobot Plankton: Roses are red. Violets are blue. World domination has nothing on you.\nPlankton: Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan.  You\" on the ground, but while destroying some of the town when doing this. Mama Krabs reads it and screams a few times Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal.\nMama Krabs: Am I really that pretty?\nPlankton: Oh, yeah... I am smooth.  Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this.\nMama Krabs: Hello?  I'm hanging up.\nPlankton: Wait! This is your secret admirer.\nMama Krabs: Oh, you're that giant robot?\nPlankton: No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?\nMama Krabs: How did you know I wanted a hat? Have you been spying on me?\nPlankton: It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.\nMama Krabs: Well, how about the Krusty Krab? Tonight at 8:00?\nPlankton: Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear.\nMr. Krabs: Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!\nSpongeBob: OK.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet.  Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance.\nMama Krabs: Isn't it nice, Eugene? It's just the one I wanted.\nMr. Krabs: But, Mommy, you shouldn't be spending my inheritance...I mean, since you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up.\nMama Krabs: Where did you get this old thing?\nNat: She looks so peaceful.\nFred: Yeah. But wasn't she wearing a hat?\nMama Krabs: You can take this one back to the trash heap.\nMr. Krabs: Yes, Mommy.  Squidward, I need you to make a return for me.\nMama Krabs: Thank ye for your concern for my finances, but me new boyfriend bought me this hat.\nMr. Krabs: Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?\nMama Krabs: I don't know. I'm meeting him here, tonight.\nMr. Krabs: Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime!\nPlankton: I've reservations for two, tonight.\nSpongeBob: Right this way, sir.\nPlankton: Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!\nSpongeBob: Terribly sorry, sir.  Will there be anything else?\nPlankton: Is my tie on straight?\nSpongeBob: You look fabulous!  Your gentlemen caller awaits.\nPlankton: Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight.\nMama Krabs: Oh, my, you're a tiny thing, but awfully cute. Tell me about yourself.\nPlankton: Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.\nMama Krabs: Never heard of it.\nPlankton: It's across the street.\nMama Krabs: Doesn't ring a bell.\nPlankton: It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad!  Never mind, never mind. I'd like to hear about you.\nMama Krabs: Well...\nMr. Krabs: Plankton!\nPlankton: Krabs!\nMama Krabs: Eugene!\nMr. Krabs: Mommy?\nPlankton: \"Mommy?\"\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob...!\nPlankton: This delectable creature is your mother?\nMr. Krabs: This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?\nSpongeBob: And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skulduggery you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out.\nMama Krabs: Eugene, you put me boyfriend down, this instant!\nPlankton: Boyfriend?\nMr. Krabs: But, mommy...\nPlankton: You heard the lady. Let me go.\nPlankton: That's more like it.\nMama Krabs: Come, Plankton. I'm sorry me son had to spoil our romantic evening.\nMr. Krabs: Mommy?  You!\nPlankton: Eugene.\nMr. Krabs: I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.\nPlankton: I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.\nMr. Krabs: All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.\nPlankton: What are you talking about?\nMr. Krabs: I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!\nPlankton: Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?\nMr. Krabs: Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family!  I'm telling you for the last time: stay away from me mother.\nPlankton: Not family, eh? I can fix that.\nMama Krabs: Eugene!\nMr. Krabs: Mommy!\nMama Krabs: What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?\nMr. Krabs: Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.\nMama Krabs: For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula. I doubt that he even knows that I know it.\nMr. Krabs: Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.\nMama Krabs: I forbid ye to interfere in me private business. Go to your office, now!\nMr. Krabs: Yes, mommy.\nPlankton: Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.\nMama Krabs: Oh, Sheldon.\nPlankton: Oh, Mrs. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, brother.\nPlankton: Attention, attention, everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.\nCrowd: Aw!\nPlankton: Would you marry me?\nMr. Krabs: Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man!\nPlankton: Gasp!\nMr. Krabs: Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!\nPlankton: Too late, Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son!  Huh? What's this, honey bunch?\nMama Krabs: I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment.\nPlankton: What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there?\nRobot Plankton: I... I... this is very uncomfortable. I'll just wait in the car.\nPlankton: I don't believe this! You led me on!\nMama Krabs: Now, now, Plankton, it's not what ye think.\nPlankton: I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.\nMama Krabs: The formula? Is that what this whole thing was about?\nPlankton: No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh.  Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost than never to be loved at all!\nKaren: Working.\nPlankton: So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?\nKaren: What did you say?\nPlankton: Nothing, dear.\nKaren: Yeah, that's what I thought you said, honey bunch.\n","68a\nPatrick SmartPants\nPatrick: You're it.\nSpongeBob: You're it.  Wait, Pat, you're it!  The sign!\nPatrick: Huh?  Duuhh... aaann... ger...  cliff!\nSpongeBob: Patrick!  Let me help you out of there, buddy!  Is the rest of you down there?\nPatrick: The rest of me is up here.\nSpongeBob: Whew, you had me worried there, buddy.  Here's your head.\nPatrick: I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.\nSpongeBob: Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'!  Go ahead, you get first crack.\nPatrick: Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.\nSpongeBob: Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.\nPatrick: Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.\nSpongeBob: Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets. C'mon, Patrick.  Look, buddy, I captured one!\nPatrick: Yes...  I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner.\nSpongeBob: Okay...what do you wanna do?\nPatrick: Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.\nSpongeBob: Pretty.\nPatrick: Yes, quite.\nSpongeBob: Fragile.\nPatrick: Indeed.\nSpongeBob: C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun.\nPatrick: Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?\nSpongeBob: I was thinking more like jumping rope,  1-legged races , or playing duck-duck-hermit crab.\nPatrick: Doesn't feel like fun.\nSpongeBob: How about some jokes?  Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?\nPatrick: You can't strum a jellyfish.\nSpongeBob: Yes!\nPatrick: Oh my, look at the time. I really must be going.\nSpongeBob: What's wrong with Patrick? I sure hope he gets better soon.  Are you better, Pat? Uhh, whatcha doing?\nPatrick: Just studying this amazing sub-species.\nPlankton: I'll show you subspecies!\nSpongeBob: Wanna visit Squidward?\nPatrick: Well, since I am finished with my work, I'll humor you with your trivial pursuits.  I'd recognize that piece anywhere! Cornelius Pufferfish's Opus 67, \"Symphony in Blue.\"\nSquidward: Patrick?\nPatrick: It's a beautiful piece. Execution needs some work.  May I suggest on the 7th bar of the adagio andante that you add a little fortissimo on the arpeggiated b-flat scale.\nSquidward: Wow, I never thought to do it like that.\nPatrick: Well, that is because you rarely think.\nSpongeBob: How do you know so much about music?\nPatrick: A creative outlet provides a spiritual release and helps facilitate a healthy mental balance.  Ah.\nSpongeBob: Does that include...  belch-talk-ing?\nPatrick: Mr. SquarePants, I find your humor vulgar.\nSquidward: I had no idea you were so knowledgeable, Patrick. Do you think you can be my musical mentor?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, guys?\nPatrick: Let's take it from the top.  Not so excellent, Squidward. Let me demonstrate the proper technique.  On second thought, practice makes perfect. Let's begin.  Thank you, my good chap. Unfortunately, this is a solo piece for clarinet only. And 1, 2, 3, 4...  Stop! Enough!  Find yourself a new mentor!\nSpongeBob: Now that you have some free-time, let's get some grub.\nPatrick: No, SpongeBob, I'm afraid not.\nSpongeBob: Well, I have a brand new bottle of super-bubbly bubble soap.\nPatrick: No, thanks again.\nSpongeBob: Well, maybe later we can play pirates.\nPatrick: Robert, my dear, it's no use. We've just grown apart.\nSpongeBob: What? What do you mean?\nPatrick: I know we've had fun in the past, but we're just not compatible anymore. It's time we went our separate ways...such is life.\nSpongeBob: But Patrick... you're my best friend.\nPatrick: I know it's hard, but brace up, chap.\nSpongeBob: Yeah.\nPatrick: Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Think fondly of me, Mr. SquarePants.\nSpongeBob: Goodbye... Mr... Best friend!  Sandy, you there? I need some professional help.  Patrick?\nSandy: Well, Pat, the new you gets an A+.\nPatrick: Why, thank you, Sandra. I find your intellect rather stimulating as well.\nSandy: Oh, really? Well, thanks.  Well, Patrick, what do you think about this problem?\nPatrick: You simply change the literal term to a coefficient and the minuend will achieve the desired quotient. Even the simplest of mammals can figure it out with a little thought.\nSandy: What do you mean by that, Patrick?\nPatrick: I'm merely suggesting you lack the ability to solve remedial equations.\nSandy: Are you suggesting I'm dumb?\nPatrick: I'd use a more sophisticated word like 'impaired'.\nSandy: I think you'd better leave.\nPatrick: I was only trying to help.\nSandy: I don't need your kind of help, Mr. know-it-all. I liked you better when you were a barnacle head!\nSpongeBob: I never thought I'd lose my best friend. How can I compete with geniusness? Ohhhhhh!\nPatrick: Surrounded by knowledge and no one to share it with. No one I can call friend. Who's that old chap I used to run with?  SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Well, at least Patrick's my friend in my memories.\nPatrick: Aww, the glory days, why have we grown apart? I must apply all that I know to solve this problem!  What could it be?  What's different? Ah!  What?! I'd do anything to have my old buddy back by my side again!\nSpongeBob: Coming...  Patrick, you're kidnapping me?\nPatrick: Yes, I am.\nSpongeBob: Yay!  What should we do?\nPatrick: We are going to have fun. Whatever the cost may be.\nSpongeBob: Let's do this.\nPatrick: Yes, let's have some fun.\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah!\nPatrick: Oh, absolutely!  Are you quite sure I found this activity to be fun?\nSpongeBob: Yeah.  That was fun, huh Patrick?\nPatrick: When did the fun go away, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off.\nPatrick: That's it!\nSpongeBob: That's what? Patrick, what are you doing?\nPatrick: I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...nge!\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Hold on, buddy!  There ya go.  Don't worry, Patrick. I found your head last time, I'll find it again!  Not back there.  Not under here. What if I can't find it? Oh, poor headless Patrick!  Patrick, your head is back! But, uhh, do you feel different?\nPatrick: Quite unchanged, actually.\nSpongeBob: I guess... we'll never have fun together again.\nPatrick: You said you found my dislodged cranial cap last time.\nSpongeBob: Yes.\nPatrick: Where exactly did you find it?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, it was right here.\nPatrick: Hmmm, impossible! If I landed here, the trajectory of my dismembered skull would cause it to come to rest, not there, but here, exactly five meters due north.\nSpongeBob: But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over...  Brain Coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy.  Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and sophisticated to be my friend again?\nPatrick: Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot!\nSpongeBob: Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal.  Patrick? Say something, Patrick.\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're back!\nPatrick: Patrick, you're back.\n","68b\nSquidBob TentaclePants\nTina-Fran: Squidward, we love you!\nAudience Member #2: I love you, Squidward.

Your star will shine at the clarinet recital tomorrow.\nSpongeBob: Time for another glorious day at work.  Good morning, Squidward!  And isn't it a lovely morning? Why are you playing the clarinet on your way to work?\nSquidward: I'm practicing for my clarinet recital. Soon, all of Bikini Bottom will recognize the talent that is Squidward Tentacles. Goodbye, SpongeBoob.\nSpongeBob: See ya at the Krusty Krab, Squidwart. Hey, Sandy, what's this?\nSandy: Well, this here is my new matter transporter. It can move things from one place to another in the blink of an eye.\nSpongeBob: Ooh, that sounds fancy.\nSandy: Let me show you how it works.\nSpongeBob: Whoa!  Where'd it go?\nSandy: Just where you think it would be.\nMrs. Puff: Oh!\nSpongeBob: Uh-oh, I'm late for work. Do you think your machine can zap me over to the Krusty Krab?\nSandy: I always did want to try a critter. Sure, why not? Get in there, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Whoo-hoo!\nSandy: Hold on tight.\nSpongeBob: Gee, Sandy, this sure feels...\nSquidward: Well, here we go again.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward!\nSandy: What's going on with this thing?  What in tarnation?\nSpongeBob: Hi, Sandy!\nSquidward: I'm not sure what it is, but I something seems different about me.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, me too.\nSquidward: Hey, what are you doing with my hand? What am I doing with your hand? Ahh! What is this? We're all mixed up together.  This is horrible! I have my clarinet recital tomorrow!\nSpongeBob: Oh, it's not so bad, Squidward. Now we can be best buddies and do everything together, forever.\nSquidward: Sandy, was this your doing? You've got to get us separated!\nSandy: Well, I wish I knew how.\nSquidward: Well, you have to do something!

But it's still in the embryonic stage.\nSquidward: Try anything! I cannot go to my clarinet recital like this.\nSandy: I'll continue working on it.

The Krusty Towers is now opened for business!\nSpongeBob: Why did you build a hotel, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I'm glad you asked, son. Remember when I went to that fast food convention and stayed in that fancy hotel? I had a beautiful room. The employees were so friendly. They catered to me every whim, no matter how demeaning it was. Because they lived by a code. And that code was engraved in fine gold above the grand fireplace: \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\". Everything was perfect until I got the bill! They charged me for everything. $25 for a hamburger!  If they can charge that much for a lousy burger, imagine how much I could charge for a lousy Krabby Patty! And thus, the Krusty Towers was born.\nSquidward: Why would anyone stay in a hotel in Bikini Bottom? It's in the middle of scenic nowhere! There's nothing to do but get stung by jellyfish.  See?\nSpongeBob: Ooh!\nMr. Krabs: Come inside.  Isn't it beautiful?\nSquidward: Where are all the new hotel employees?\nMr. Krabs: My first hotel guest! Watch me reel him in.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers, where our motto is \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\".\nDave: Oh, that's great. I'd like a double Krabby Patty with no onions and extra pickles.\nMr. Krabs: If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to rent a room and order room service.\nDave: Ooh, I've only got an hour for lunch.\nSquidward: Boy, you reeled that one in like a pro.\nMr. Krabs: Okay, Squidward, you man the front desk.\nPatrick: I'd like a Krabby Patty, please.\nSquidward: This is a hotel now. If you want a Krabby Patty, you'll have to get a room and order room service.\nPatrick: Okay, one Krabby Patty and one room with cheese. Oh, and can I get cheese on the Krabby Patty, too?\nSquidward: Patrick, you only live 400 yards away. Why do you want to check into a hotel?\nPatrick: Sometimes I just need to get away from it all.  Wow, this hotel has everything!\nSquidward: Gimme that! Now sign the register.\nPatrick: I didn't know there would be a test. I didn't study!\nSquidward: Patrick, all you have to do is write your name.\nPatrick: Oh, okay.  Do you mind?!  Don't look!  Done!\nSquidward: Close enough. Here's your room key.\nPatrick: I'll need some help with my bags.\nSquidward: How can you have bags?! You just found out this is a hotel!\nPatrick: This is a hotel?\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Yes, Squidward?\nSquidward: Take Patrick and his bags to his room.\nPatrick: What about my Krabby Patty?\nSquidward: And bring him a Krabby Patty.\nMr. Krabs: Squidward, you can take Patrick's bags up to his room. SpongeBob, you go make the Krabby Patty.\nSquidward: Oh, Mr Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: What's the matter? Afraid of a little manual labor?  I'm Squidward and I have to work for a living. Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo.\nSquidward: Fine. Let's go, Patrick.\nMr. Krabs: This elevator is for guests only. Take the employee elevator.\nSquidward: What's in these bags, rocks?  Hey, these are rocks! Why is your suitcase full of rocks?\nPatrick: I don't tell you how to live your life!\nSquidward: Well, here's your room.\nPatrick: Wow.\nSquidward: Enjoy your stay.\nPatrick: Squidward, wait!  Keep up the good work and there'll be more where that came from.\nSpongeBob: Your Krabby Patty, sir.  Hey, Squidward, cool rock.\nPatrick: Hold on a second, SpongeBob.  Here you are, my good man.\nSpongeBob: Why, thank you, Patrick!\nPatrick: There's plenty more where that came from, my good friend  Squidward!\nSquidward: What now?!\nPatrick: I don't like crusts on my sandwich!\nSquidward: It's a bun; it's all crust! How am I suppose to cut the crust off a bun?\nPatrick: Peel it.\nSquidward: Happy?\nSpongeBob: Room service! Here's the fifty Krabby Patties you ordered.\nPatrick: Could you do one more thing for me?\nSquidward: Why don't you ask SpongeBob?\nPatrick: Good idea, Squidward!\nSpongeBob: How may I serve you, sir?\nPatrick: I need you to eat these Krabby Patties with me.\nSpongeBob: Oh, yes, sir!\nMr. Krabs: Hold on. Squidward! Patrick needs your help.\nSquidward: What?! Why didn't he ask me before I walked all the way downstairs?\nMr. Krabs: He said he didn't want to bother you, but he got over it.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward!\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, this is ridiculous! Patrick's being completely unreasonable!\nMr. Krabs: He can be as unreasonable as he wants! The plaque, Squidward, the plaque!\nSquidward: But, Mr. Krabs...\nMr. Krabs: Deny no guests!  Why, hello, Patrick. You need Squidward to come up right away? He'll be right there.\nSquidward: A bubble bath?! Why would I give you a bubble bath?!\nPatrick: Well, because Mr. Krabs said you would! Well, be sure to make my back extra shiny clean.\nSquidward: That's it! I've had enough!\nPatrick: Squidward, wait! The toilet's backed up again!\nMr. Krabs: Hey! Hey, you can't take that elevator! You're an employee!\nSquidward: Not anymore. I quit.\nMr. Krabs: Quit? You can't quit.  Welcome to the Krusty Towers... Squidward?!\nSquidward: One room, please. On the top floor.\nMr. Krabs: What do you think you're doing?\nSquidward: I need a vacation. I'm overworked. And what better place to relax than Krusty Towers? Where \"we shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\".\nMr. Krabs: I don't have to rent you a room!\nSquidward: I've got cash.\nMr. Krabs: Oh... here's your room key.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, carry my things to my room.\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, guest sir.\nSquidward: And you can carry me to my room.\nMr. Krabs: And why in tarnation would I do that? You got four legs that aren't broken.\nSquidward: The plaque.  Too bad we couldn't take the elevator, but it is for guests only, and you are an employee.\nSpongeBob: Your room, sir.\nSquidward: And I'd like to order room service. I'd like a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenail clippings, and nose hair.\nMr. Krabs: You've got to be kidding me!\nSquidward: And I want it here in five seconds.\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir!  Here you are, sir.\nMr. Krabs: Well, you got your stinky sandwich. Now eat it.\nSquidward: Oh, I'm not gonna eat this. You are.\nMr. Krabs: What?! You're out of your mind if you think I'm going to eat that!\nSpongeBob: Psst, that's not really a Krabby Patty with cheese, toenails, and nose hair.\nMr. Krabs: Now I get ya, boy. Alright, Squidward.  SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs! We were all out of cheese.\nPatrick: Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: What is it, Squidward?\nSquidward: Send up a dozen cookies just like mother used to make.\nMr. Krabs: Here's your homemade cookies.\nSquidward: These don't taste like anything mom used to make!\nMr. Krabs: Well, how did your mother make 'em?\nSquidward: How should I know?! Ask my mother!\nMrs. Tentacles: Hello?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: No good, Mr. Krabs.\nMrs. Tentacles: Allow me, boy.\nMr. Krabs: Great! Now that me laundry's in the trunk...\nSpongeBob: There's room for you to sit up front!\nMrs. Tentacles: Let's go bake some cookies, boys.\nSpongeBob and Mr. Krabs: Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: Well?\nSquidward: I'm impressed! These are just like mother used to make! I just wish mom was a better cook.\nMr. Krabs: So you're all taken care of?\nSquidward: Hm, just one teensy tiny problem. This room is hideous. Redesign it. Neptune the 14th would be nice.\nMr. Krabs: What?\nSquidward: \"We shall never deny a guest even the most ridiculous request\".  Perfect!\nMr. Krabs: This room is exactly the same as when we started!\nSquidward: Nothing like getting back to the basics.\nMr. Krabs: Let's get outta here, SpongeBob!\nSquidward: Oh, before you leave, I wanna go swimming.\nMr. Krabs: The pool's out back!\nSquidward: Ha ha, are you crazy? I'm not going outside to swim.  Come on in, the water's fine.\nMr. Krabs: Anything else stupid and unreasonable that you want?\nSquidward: Nope, that's it.\nMr. Krabs: You don't need me to chew your food for ya? Or make you a back scratcher out of me own spine? Or maybe extinguish the sun so the light don't get in your eyes?!\nSquidward: No, I'm good.\nSpongeBob: Me, too.\nPatrick: Wow, an indoor pool?! Well, this place is fancy!  Cannonball!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, that hotel was a bad idea from the start.\nPatrick: That was a hotel?\nNurse: Your bill, sir.\nMr. Krabs: $15,000?!\nSquidward: You're not gonna have a heart attack, are you?\nMr. Krabs: Not at these prices! Forget hotels. This hospital rack is where the money is!\nPatrick: This is a hospital?\nMr. Krabs: Pack your bags, boys! You're going to medical school!\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Hooray!\nSquidward: Oh, boy.\n","69b\nMrs. Puff, You're Fired\nMr. Fitz: Morning, Mrs. Puff. I'm Mr. Fitz. I represent the 'Boating School Teachers Accreditation Bureau'. As you know your teaching certificate is up for renewal. However, we have noticed there have been an unusual large number of failings from this classroom.\nMrs. Puff: That's impossible. In all my years of teaching, only one student has failed my class.\nMr. Fitz: Yes, but he's failed 1,258,056 times.\nMrs. Puff: You don't understand. SpongeBob is unteachable.\nMr. Fitz: We cannot blame the students for the incompetence of the teacher.\nSpongeBob: Honk honk! Beep beep! I'm ready to drive. Are you ready for my driving test today, Mrs. Puff?\nMr. Fitz: Okay, Mrs. Puff, if SpongeBob fails this test, you will be replaced.\nMrs. Puff: Okay, SpongeBob, let's demonstrate for Mr. Fitz everything I've taught you in boating school. Now, what's the first thing we do before we start boating?\nSpongeBob: Seat-belt-aroony. One second.\nMrs. Puff: Then what do you do?\nSpongeBob: Start the engine?\nMrs. Puff: Yes.\nSpongeBob: Now what do I do?\nMrs. Puff: Drive the boat.\nSpongeBob: Did I pass this time, Mrs. Puff?\nMrs. Puff: No, SpongeBob, you failed.\nSpongeBob: I failed?\nMr. Fitz: It's not you that failed, SpongeBob. It's Mrs. Puff that's failed you. You are relieved of your teaching duties.\nMrs. Puff: I won't be teaching SpongeBob anymore?  No more... SpongeBob? I thought this day would never come. Goodbye, SpongeBob! Have a nice life. \"\" Free at last, Free At Last!\nSpongeBob: I got Mrs. Puff fired.\nRoderick: Hello, worthless students. I'm your new instructor.  No one's ever failed my class... that's lived through it. I can assure you these next 4 weeks will be the worst years of your miserable lives. Your spine will break, your teeth will ache, your eyes will be bloodshot. You will drive out of this school in style. Or you will be carted out in your granny's hand basket. Everyone will follow the rules of the class. First rule: No talking.\nPeterson: Does that mean...\nRoderick: Second Rule: no eating in my class. Would anyone care for a bon-bon.\nMonroe: Uhh, I'll eat one.\nRoderick: Pick your favorite.  How's it taste?\nMonroe: It's a delightful taste sensation.\nRoderick: No eating in my classroom!  Now, if anyone else is man enough to stay in this class...  Looks like you're the man, Sponge.\nSpongeBob: I am?\nRoderick: Do you wanna learn how to drive or what?\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir! I'm ready to drive\nRoderick: What do you think you're doing?\nSpongeBob: Ready for my test, sir.\nRoderick: You're not ready to drive yet until you learn that first.  This is  most grueling driving course ever devised. You will learn every turn, bump, and crack on it. You'll start out crawling it.\nSpongeBob: Crawl?\nRoderick: Hut two. Hut two. Hut two. Hut two.\nSpongeBob: Left turn.  Crack. Bump. Nickel. Hey a nickel!\nRoderick: Keep your eyes on the road, cadet.\nSpongeBob: Pebble!  Oh whoa!  Oh whoa!  Whew!\nRoderick: I'm ashamed of you, cadet.  Tripped up by a wee pebble.  What are you suppose to be learning in my class?\nSpongeBob: How to drive, sir?\nRoderick: Affirmative. But before you learn to drive, you must learn to crawl. Then you learn to walk and then you learn to run. But before you learn to walk, you must learn to crawl.  I want you to crawl!\nSpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!\nRoderick: Now get out there!  Every good boater needs to know his vehicle inside and out.  Here, go take that boat apart.  I'm impressed, son. Put it back together again!\nSpongeBob: That'll be easy.\nRoderick: Are you sure?\nSpongeBob: Um, yeah. You just put the jigamahoo on the doohicky and uhh...  I might need a couple minutes.  It's ready, sarge!\nRoderick: Jumpin' jellyfish...\nSpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians. Check mirrors. Observe that speed limit. Watch for pedestrians!  So, umm, how'd I do?\nRoderick: How'd you do? Why don't you ask the shattered remains of this pedestrian... HOW YOU DID!\nSpongeBob: Now I know this forwards, backwards, and sideways. Am I ready to get behind the wheel?\nRoderick: Not quite.  Now do it blindfolded.\nNarrator: Several days later...\nSpongeBob: 1003, 1004, 1005.  Ooh, pebble #143.  Ha! You will not trip me up again, pebble #143. 1006, 1007, 1008.  Old lady with a ham sandwich. 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1... 13.\nRoderick: Congratulations. You're ready to get behind the wheel.\nSpongeBob: Really? I'm ready! I'm ready. I'm...\nRoderick: Let's see what I taught you, laddy.\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir!  Left turn at pebble #143. Kid with a ball.  Nice boy.\nRoderick: Nice driving. Now parallel park up ahead.  Very good.  Now, boy, the time has come to show Mr. Fits what you've learn.\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir! Step 1: seatbelts.\nRoderick: Excellent work, cadet. What's next?\nSpongeBob: Step 2 would be... ignite engine.\nRoderick: Step 3?\nSpongeBob: Step 3 would be...  ...engage blindfold.\nRoderick: What? You can't drive a boat with a blindfold on. That's illegal.\nSpongeBob: But I can't do it without a blindfold.\nRoderick: Drive, boy! Drive!\nRoderick: Mayday! Mayday! You're off course.\nMrs. Puff: Ah, I feel so serene now that I'm away from that homicidal maniac, SpongeBob.\nRoderick: The brake son!\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.  There you go, sir. All I had to do was unscrew two of the bolts.\nRoderick: I'm gonna stop this thing. Tell my wife I love her.  Come get some!\nSpongeBob: Man down. Man down.  Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I can't stop the boat right now.  I can't see! I can't see!\nPatrick: My pants!\nSpongeBob: Hey, I can't see!  Did I pass?\nMr. Fitz: Well, if there was a 'destroy the city' part of the test, you would have.\nPatrick: The nerve of some people.\nMr. Fitz: Sorry, SpongeBob, you failed again. Even our finest instructor could not teach you. Mrs. Puff, you're hired again.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mrs. Puff! Sorry I'm \"unteachable\".\nMrs. Puff: It's okay. Mr. Fitz gave me my teaching certificate back.  And your dossier was destroyed in the explosion,  so it's as if you never failed.\nSpongeBob: I got you a welcome back gift, Mrs. Puff.  I found all the pieces and glued them back together. I promise it won't take me a million tries this time.\n","70a\nChimps Ahoy\nSpongeBob and Patrick: It's here!\nSpongeBob: Behold, Patrick! The official Goofy Goober Backscratcher! And it only cost me 52 box tops.\nPatrick: Wow.\nSpongeBob: Ooh. Mm-hmm. Oh... Oh! Whoo! Oh, yeah, that's it!\nPatrick: Let me try!\nSpongeBob: Uh, Patrick, that's not the backscratcher. That's my arm.\nPatrick: Oh, sorry.\nSpongeBob: You know, we shouldn't keep this all to ourselves. We should let Squidward try it out.\nPatrick: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Onward... to Squidward's house.\nSquidward: Go away!\nSpongeBob: To Sandy's house.  Hey, Sandy, you gotta see this!  Sandy? What's going on here?! Sandy, are you okay?  What's wrong, Sandy?\nSandy: They're coming. They're coming. The chimps are coming.\nSpongeBob: Who?\nSandy: My bosses. They're coming for an inspection. I've worked day and night for a week, but none of my inventions are any good. If I don't have a real impressive invention by this afternoon, they'll cut my funding, and I'll have to leave Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: Oh, come on, Sandy. I'll bet you invented lots of useful things. This helmet looks impressive.  What's it do?\nSandy: It lets you talk to nuts. What use is that?\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Peanut. Come in, Peanut.\nPatrick: What's it saying?\nSpongeBob: It's saying... \"It's dark in here.\" Got anything else, Sandy?\nSandy: There's my nuttaccino machine. It makes a hot, frothy cup of any nut you choose.  And lastly, my fully automated nutcracker.  Oh, I can't even make a simple nutcracker!\nSpongeBob: So it's got a few bugs. Patrick and I'll help you fix it. Right, Patrick? Patrick?  Everything'll be fine.\nSandy: Oh, it's no use, SpongeBob! I just have to face facts. I'm leaving Bikini Bottom because... I'm a failure.\nSpongeBob: We can't let Sandy leave, Patrick!\nPatrick: What'll we do?\nSpongeBob: They're looking for an invention, right?\nPatrick: Right.\nSpongeBob: So let's start inventing!\nPatrick: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: It's time to get serious, Patrick.\nPatrick: Right!  I made an invention. It's a stick you can draw or write stuff with.\nSpongeBob: That's a pencil, Patrick. It's already been invented.\nPatrick: Ooh, ooh, this is a good one! It's a glass ball that lights up so you can see in the dark.\nSpongeBob: Light bulb, already invented.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, I know this one will work. I've invented a parallel universe.\nSpongeBob: That's a mirror, Patrick. It's already been invented.\nPatrick: Somebody keeps stealing my ideas!\nSpongeBob's Reflection: Well, I thought it was a pretty good idea.\nSpongeBob: Ooh... I give up. I'll never invent anything.\nSandy: \u266aSo long, Bikini Bottom, I can't leave without a good-bye. But please don't think bad of me, if'n I start to cry. So long, Bikini Bottom, there's so many things I'll miss, from your smoggy, crowded city, to your stingin' jellyfish. This town is filled with many things, that I've come to love. From the birds that fly upon the ground, to the flowers up above. Farewell, Bikini Bottom, now I really hate to go. 'Cause the things I'll miss the most of all, are the friends I've come to know.\u266a\nSpongeBob: I'm ashamed of myself, Patrick. I gave up too quickly. We'll build Sandy's bosses an invention so amazing, they'll give Sandy funding forever!  We've done it, Patrick! We've created the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Patrick, they're here.\nPatrick: Who?\nSpongeBob: Sandy's bosses.  The reason we spent all afternoon inventing!\nPatrick: I have no idea what you're talking about.\nChimp #1: Good day, gentlemen. Allow me to introduce ourselves. I am Professor Percy. This is Dr. Marmalade.\nDr. Marmalade: At your service.\nProfessor Percy: And this is Lord Reginald.\nLord Reginald: Charmed.\nPatrick: You guys talk funny. Say more words!\nProfessor Percy: We are the board of directors of Tree Dome Enterprises Limited, and we are here to ascertain if Miss Cheek's inventions are up to snuff.\nSpongeBob: Why, everyone in town has benefited from Sandy's scientific knowledge! Before Sandy showed up, I used to be a scrawny weakling!\nPatrick: And I used to be dumb.\nProfessor Percy: Quite. And whom do I have the pleasure of addressing?\nSpongeBob: My name is SpongeBob.\nPatrick: And I am Professor Patrick.\nSpongeBob: Professor?\nPatrick: Doctor Professor Patrick. Don't mind him. You know how interns are.\nProfessor Percy: Where is Miss Cheeks?\nSpongeBob: She should be back any moment.\nPatrick: I thought she ran away because she couldn't invent anything.\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\nPatrick: That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick to you!\nSpongeBob: Don't you think it's time to show them Sandy's invention, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick?\nPatrick: Good idea.\nSpongeBob: Well?\nPatrick: Hey, you're the unpaid intern. You do the work.\nSpongeBob: Gentlemen, I can say without exaggeration that this is the most important invention in the history of the universe! I give you...  The Automatic Backscratcher, Hair Comber, Nose Picker, and Ukulele Tuner 9000!\nProfessor Percy: This is where our research money went?\nSpongeBob: Uh-huh. Isn't it great?!\nLord Reginald: An automatic back scratcher, hair comber, nose picker, ukulele tuner. Yes, well, I've heard that claim before.\nProfessor Percy: Yes, how do we know this contraption works?\nDr. Marmalade: Let's see a demonstration.\nPatrick: Step right up.  You look like you've been neglecting your personal hygiene.\nLord Reginald: Me?  Are you sure this is safe?\nPatrick: As sure as I'm a doctor professor.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, don't you think we should test it?\nPatrick: Okay.\nSpongeBob: That's not exactly what I had in mind!\nProfessor Percy: Lord Reginald, are you all right?\nLord Reginald: Oh, I say, this is splendid.  Oh, absolutely splendid. What's this?  Oh, marvelous. This machine has evacuated my nostrils of unwanted residue in a manner most pleasant.\nSpongeBob: Good work, Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.\nPatrick: Thank you, lowly assistant.\nLord Reginald: Oh, I say, now it's feeding me delicious pudding!\nSpongeBob: Pudding? I don't remember that part of the invention.\nLord Reginald: Now it's tuning my ukulele!  Ouch! Ooh! I say, was that necessary?  You, sir, are impertinent.  Oh, dear.\nDr. Marmalade: Lord Reginald, are you all right?  I'm sorry, was that a yes?\nProfessor Percy: Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick, what is the meaning of this?\nPatrick: It's okay. The horrible screaming means that it's working!\nSpongeBob: Oh, I really wish Sandy were here.\nBus Driver: All aboard!\nSandy: Will this bus take you somewhere when you've got nowhere else to go?\nBus Driver: It sure does. We make stops in Quittersville, Failuretown, and Loserburg.\nSandy: What in tarnation?!  What's with all the monkey business?!\nSpongeBob: Sandy!\nSandy: SpongeBob! What the heck is going on here?!\nLord Reginald: Ouch.\nPatrick: It works! It works!\nProfessor Percy: Lord Reginald, are you all right?\nLord Reginald: I seem to have ruptured my pomposity.\nProfessor Percy: We shall commence closure of this establishment immediately.\nDr. Marmalade: Frankly, I'm beginning to question the economic benefits of underwater treedomes. Doesn't make much sense once you get right down to it.\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Sandy. We were trying to keep you in Bikini Bottom, but all we did was ruin your chances to stay.\nSandy: I was about to be fired anyway. Thanks for trying to help, SpongeBob. You, too, Patrick.\nPatrick: That's Mr. Doctor Professor Patrick.\nSandy: Don't push it.\nPatrick: Sorry.\nProfessor Percy: We are departing, Dr. Marmalade.\nDr. Marmalade: My word, all of this excitement has drastically reduced my potassium levels.  Good gracious! Can it be?\nProfessor Percy: Try it again.\nLord Reginald: Oh! It is! It is! It's the banana peeler we have been searching 117 years for!\nSpongeBob: Wow, Sandy, they're going bananas for your nutcracker!\nSandy: Yeah.\nProfessor Percy: Well, Miss Cheeks, I must say you have exceeded expectations.\nLord Reginald: It may be the extreme head trauma I've suffered, but I am going to offer you a 20-year contract with a substantial pay raise.\nSandy: I accept.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!\nProfessor Percy: I expect great things out of you, Miss Cheeks. Great things.\nLord Reginald: Perhaps you could put your talents toward that automatic poop-throwing machine that's eluded us for so long.\nDr. Marmalade: Now, now, one miracle at a time.\nAll Chimps: Goodbye!\nSandy: Well, the only thing left is to figure out what to do with this infernal contraption.\nPatrick: My turn.  Whoo-hoo!  All right!\n","70b\nGhost Host\nFlying Dutchman: Curse this cursed, ghostly fog. I can barely see past me own nose.  Urrgh!   Arrgh!  Me ship.  Hello, Roadside Assistance?

I meant that I'm just used to it, that's all.\nFlying Dutchman: Don't lie to me!\nSpongeBob: You just gotta scare someone other than me.\nFlying Dutchman: Hmm...\nFish: Mind if I test it out?  Yeah, this does feel comfortable.\nMattress Salesman: Would you excuse me for a moment?\nFlying Dutchman: Grr!  Raargh! Raargh! Move! Raargh!  Ah, forget it.\nMattress Salesman: So, what do you think?\nFlying Dutchman: It's official; I'm not scary anymore.\nSpongeBob: Just what kinda talk is that? You're just off your game, that's all.\nFlying Dutchman: Maybe I just need a break. Take some time off, you know?\nSpongeBob: Sure, relax a little.\nFlying Dutchman: Maybe stay with a friend for a while. On a comfy couch in a pineapple. Just for a little while longer? 'Til I get back on my feet?\nNarrator: 6 Months Later...\nSpongeBob: Hey, champ! How's it...\nRed Ghost: Turn it up...\nPurple Ghost: Turn the knob up.\nYellow Ghost: Whoo!\nFlying Dutchman: Who'd guess we have so much in common? You like teddy bears; I like teddy bears. You like ponies; I like ponies!\nNancy: Is that a wedding ring?\nFlying Dutchman: Oh, this?

Time to scoot, honey.\nSpongeBob: Dutchie! Do you wanna spend eternity on this couch?\nFlying Dutchman: Well, it is comfy.\nSpongeBob: Look in the mirror. You're a ghost of your former self!\nFlying Dutchman: Ah, you're right, SpongeBob. I'm pathetic.\nSpongeBob: Yes, you are. But we're going to raise you up from your squalled conditions through the use of visual aids. Watch now.\nFlying Dutchman: What in barnacles is it?\nSpongeBob: A journey into self-awareness.\nFish: The power within. The power within.\nFish #2: The power within. The power within.

No such thing.\nFlying Dutchman: No such thing as ghosts? No such thing as ghosts?! You don't believe in ghosts?!\nSquidward: SpongeBob?\nFlying Dutchman: Ooh, scary!\nSquidward: No! No! That's impossible!  Ghosts! Ghosts!\nSpongeBob: Dutchie, it worked! You got your scare back!\nFlying Dutchman: And me confidence, too. Now I feel like I can scare the living criminy out of anybody! All thanks to you, my boy.\nSpongeBob: And, maybe your ship will be repaired soon.\nFlying Dutchman: Actually, I have a confession, SpongeBob. My ship's been done for three months now. Well, it was nice roomin' with ya.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I left you a little something something for all your trouble. Now, it's time for me to ruin more souls.\nSpongeBob: Good Ol' Dutchie!\n","71a\nWhale of a Birthday\nRadio: Good morning, Bikini Bottom!

How could you think I wouldn't know that? What are you gonna be, 12?\nPearl: I'm going to be 16! It's only the most important birthday in my entire life. If I don't have a completely awesome party, my whole high school reputation will collapse. I'll have to drop out, I won't go off to college, I'll never leave home. You'll have to support me for the rest of my life.\nMr. Krabs: Well, we don't want that to happen.\nPearl: Then promise me you'll give me a real party this year. And don't be cheap!  Hi, girls.\nFriend #1: Hi, Pearl.\nPearl: Are you guys coming to my totally coral birthday party tomorrow?\nFriend #1: I don't know, Pearl. Is this going to be as totally coral as last year, when your dad passed out paper clips as party favors?\nJudy: Remember the time we all had to share one balloon?  Please.\nFriend #2: Remember the pony ride?\nFriend #1: I can't wait to see how he ruins this year.\nPearl: Daddy!\nMr. Krabs: Uh-oh. Everybody, brace for impact!\nPearl: Tell me you've got something totally coral planned for my birthday party.\nMr. Krabs: Now, now, don't snap your mizzenmast. Everything is all set.

Now promise me you won't be cheap!\nMr. Krabs: I promise.\nPearl: Good, because I made a list.  Now I want everything on this list at my party.  Bye. I'll be at the mall with my friends.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: While I plan the party, I want you to buy Pearl's present.  Here you go, boy.\nSpongeBob: What's this, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: It's me credit card. You use it instead of money.\nSpongeBob: I can buy stuff with just this piece of plastic? I don't need money?\nMr. Krabs: Exactly.\nSpongeBob: Wow.\nMr. Krabs: Now remember, nothing's too good for me little Pearl. I wanted to give her nothing, but she's too good for that. Now follow her around and see what she likes. You know, do some detective work.\nSpongeBob: Detective work. I'm going undercover.\nPearl: So, that's when Marcy told me that Julie said that Angela did like Brad.\nFriend #1: Oh.\nSpongeBob: Angela likes Brad.\nPearl: Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing I have seen in the whole world.\nSpongeBob: I'd like to buy that piece of plastic with this piece of plastic.\nCashier: Mr. Krabs, huh? Quick, how do you spell \"Krabs\"?\nSpongeBob: Umm...I'm pretty sure it has a 'B' in it.\nCashier: Close enough.  There you go, kid.\nSpongeBob: That's it? Hmmm, I'll never understand the workings of high finance.\nPearl: Wow, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in the whole world. Glitter gloss!\nSpongeBob: Oh, no, I bought the wrong present.\nJudy: Pearl, you have got to see this.\nPearl: Coming, Judy.\nMary: Oh...hmmm...\nSpongeBob: Now this is obviously the greatest present ever.\nPearl: This is the greatest thing in the whole world!\nSquidward: The banner's up, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: I've had that since the day she was born.

This is so coral.\nPearl: Oh my gosh, it's Billy Fishkins.\nAll: Hi, Billy!\nBilly: Meep.\nSpongeBob: Isn't he dreamy?\nCashier: Price check on 4.\nBilly: Meep.\nSquidward: I finished Pearl's portrait, Mr. Krabs. It's a true masterpiece.\nMr. Krabs: Hey...maybe I should have hired that ice sculptor.\nSquidward: Ice sculptor? Any fool can sculpt in ice. It takes true genius to transform 400 pounds of raw Krabby Patties into a work of such majesty.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah. Well, we've got the decor covered. Now how about entertainment? Pearl wants some boy band called 'Boys Who Cry'.\nSquidward: Boys Who Cry? They're my favorite band. They charge a million dollars just to show up. And if you want them to lip-sync, it'll run into real money.\nMr. Krabs: You're a real fan, huh?\nSquidward: Oh, yeah, I know all their songs.\nMr. Krabs: All their songs?\nPearl: Wouldn't it be cool if my dad got me this for my birthday?\nFriend #1: It sure would be. If he was cool, which he's not.\nPearl: Yeah, he probably got me another box of staples.\nMr. Krabs: It's almost time for the party to start!\nSpongeBob: I'm back, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what took you so long? And where's Pearl's present?\nSpongeBob: The delivery truck will be here momentarily.\nSquidward: Here she comes, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Everybody, get into position.\nAll: Happy birthday!\nJudy: \"It's a boy\"?!\nPearl: Daddy!\nFriend #1: Stale popcorn.  It tastes like dishwater.\nSquidward: It is dishwater.\nPearl: Is that supposed to be me?  It's made out of Krabby Patties! Gross!\nMr. Krabs: Who wants cake?\nPearl: Well, the cake does look good.  It's made out of cardboard!\nMr. Krabs: And frosting.\nFriend #1: Well, Pearl, sixteen lame parties in a row. Must be a new record. Let's get out of here.\nPearl: Wait, don't leave. My dad got Boys Who Cry to play. You did get Boys Who Cry, right?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, even better, sweetie. Hit it.\nSquidward: Hello, ladies.  When my tear ducts get issue, I can't use just any tissue... I need 4-ply, 4-Ply, 4-Ply, when I cry... Huh!\nFriend #2: Hey, that is not Boys Who Cry.\nJudy: Yeah!\nFriend #2: Boo!\nFriend #1: What a rip-off!\nJudy: This stinks!\nPearl: Daddy, how could you? I... gave... you... a list!\nMr. Krabs: Pearl, come back!\nPearl: You ruined everything! You couldn't stop being cheap, even for me.\nMr. Krabs: I'll make it up to you somehow, Pearl.\nSpongeBob: That's it. Back it up. Right there. Let 'er go!\nPearl: You bought me a boat?\nMr. Krabs: I did? I mean...I did?!\nFriends: Wow.\nPearl: Oh, daddy, I don't know how it could get better than this.\nSpongeBob: Just watch.  Hit it, boys!\nEndsong: Boys Who Cry \"It's All About You\"\nIt's all about you girl, On your sixteenth birthday! Pay attention to you girl, Everyone has to do just what you say. You get your very own spotlight tonight, Cuz it's all about you! Yeah, it's all about Pearl! You're the birthday girl!\nMr. Krabs: Boy, how much is all this costing me?\nSpongeBob: Here's the receipt.\nMr. Krabs: I ought to...\nPearl: Oh, daddy, you got me everything I wanted.\nMr. Krabs: Ah, nothing's too good for me daughter. Heh.\nSpongeBob: You're a good dad, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Don't push your luck, boy.\n","71b\nKarate Island\nSpongeBob: All right, Gary, ready for your yearly shell waxing?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Just look at that shine! Now let's check under the hood.  Geez, Gary, this place is a real snail-sty.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Still? From New Year's Eve?  What?! I've been looking everywhere for this, Gary.  My favorite novelty t-shirt!  Oh, someone's here.\nMailman: Special delivery for SpongeBob SquarePants.\nSpongeBob: Special delivery? Just for me? You think I'm...special?\nMailman: Alright, do we have to go through this every time I give you your mail? Sheesh.\nSpongeBob: What could it be today, Gary?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: A videotape?  \"You're a winner -- SpongeBob SquarePants\". I'm SpongeBob SquarePants!\nAnnouncer: Karate Island: A serene and exotic location where nature and beauty abound, and hundreds of fighting styles collide in a wave of non-stop, pulsating, no-hold barred action! For centuries, the world's top karate artists have journeyed to this land to be crowned King of Karate.\nSpongeBob: King of Karate?\nAnnouncer: Now it's your turn...\nAnnouncer 2: ...SpongeBob SquarePants.\nAnnouncer: You've won an all-expense paid trip to Karate Island! Hi-yah! Where you'll be crowned this year's King of Karate!\nSpongeBob: Ooh... Did you hear that, Gary? I'm going to be crowned...  King of Karate!  Whoo-hoo!\nSandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Hello, Sandy. Have you heard the news? I've been invited to Karate Island to be crowned the king of karate.\nSandy: Karate Island? I've never heard of Karate Island.\nSpongeBob: Oh, sure, Sandy, all the big karate experts go there.\nSandy: But, my karate is better than yours by a country mile, and I've never been invited.\nSpongeBob: Maybe your karate was the best, but now they've recognized a new number one.\nSandy: There's something rotten in the Alamo. I'd better tag along with you and see if it's on the up-and-up.\nSpongeBob: All right, Sandy, you can come with me to witness my crowning moment.  Are we there yet?\nSandy: Yup. That's it over there.\nSpongeBob: What make you think that's Karate Island?\nSandy: I don't know -- lucky guess?\nSpongeBob: Hello there, the King of Karate has arrived.\nFish: Welcome to my island, SpongeBob-san.\nSpongeBob: Oh, thank you.\nMaster Udon: I am Master Udon.\nSandy: Howdy, Master Udon, I'm Sandy Cheeks. I do a little karate, myself.\nSpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. Mr. Udon isn't interested in a karate novice like you. He only has time for royalty.\nSandy: Oh, brother.\nMaster Udon: Please, show me some of your moves, Master SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: You hear that, Sandy? He called me \"master.\" Bring on your best fighters! I'll try to go easy on 'em.\nSandy: SpongeBob, your karate's not good enough to handle those sidewinders.\nSpongeBob: Pa-shaw! Watch and learn, sister.  Yup. That's how the King of Karate does it. Who's next?\nSandy: Something smells like rancid rodeo around here.\nMaster Udon: Excellent. Truly, you are King of Karate.\nSpongeBob: The one and only.\nMaster Udon: We must make ready for your coronation.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready to be King of Karate!\nMaster Udon: King of Karate-san, it is time for you to take your rightful place on your throne.\nSpongeBob: My throne.\nSandy: All right, Udon, I'm on to you. This place is as crooked as a dizzy sidewinder.\nSpongeBob: Come, Sandy, take your place next to the king and share in my crowning achievement.  Bring a seat for my air-breathing friend.\nSandy: SpongeBob, ya'll are getting a bit wily.\nSpongeBob: Oh, do I detect a note of jealousy, Sandy?\nSandy: Heck, I could karate you into a country fiddle with one paw tied behind my back.\nSpongeBob: But who's being crowned King of Karate - not you.\nSandy: I'm getting off this crazy train!\nMaster Udon: Master, don't worry about her. She is missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime.  Let the coronation begin!\nSpongeBob: Sandy's going to miss out, big time.\nSandy: That dang SpongeBob. Who does he think he is? I taught that yellow egomaniac everything he knows about fighting -- and that ain't much.\nSpongeBob: No!\nSandy: SpongeBob's in trouble!  SpongeBob is the \"King of Karate\". He doesn't need me. Eh, he can handle this himself.\nSpongeBob: Sandy, I need you! I can't handle this myself.\nSandy: Hold on, buddy!\nSpongeBob: No, Sandy!\nMaster Udon: She will never reach you. She must first pass through the 'Four Floors of Fear'.\nSandy: SpongeBob?\nThe Tickler: Ha. Ha-ha-ha. You cannot pass unless you defeat me, The Tickler, and my iron-finger style.  Ha-ha. Look!\nSandy: Huh?\nThe Tickler: Prepare for the tickling of your life!\nSandy: Taste these!\nThe Tickler: Oh no! Jelly-filled donuts? How did you know they were my weakness?\nSandy: No one can resist jelly-filled.  Sticky around, I'll be back with the glazed.\nThe Tickler: I could use a wet napkin.\nSandy: All right, who's next?\nLip Service: Halt! No one advances past me, Lip Service, and my power-flexi dynamo-lip thruster style.\nLip Service: Dance, squirrel, dance.\nSandy: Advanced hair-dryer style!\nLip Service: What do you expect to do with that?  Oh, no! Not chapped lips!\nSandy: That's enough lip out of you.\nFilthy Phil: No one has ever made it to the lair of Filthy Phil. No one passes except me. Now, feel the steam of my horrible body odor.\nSandy: Ha-ha, Phil! Your foul stench can't permeate my fresh-air dome.\nFilthy Phil: Fresh-air dome?  Man, I really do stink.\nMaster Udon: You are one impressive squirrel. You even made a costume change.\nSandy: Release SpongeBob!\nMaster Udon: Never.  He is forbidden to leave until...he signs this contract.\nSandy: What are you talking about?\nMaster Udon: Real estate.\nSandy: You mean this whole thing was a scam to get us to buy real estate?\nMaster Udon: Yes. If there was a real Karate Island, I'd be a millionaire.\nSpongeBob: You mean I'm not King of Karate?\nMaster Udon: No. But you could be King of Condos. Here, let me explain. It's really quite simple.  See, if you invest in a time share here on Condo Island, you can see your equity increase ten-fold. Perhaps you and your yellow friend would like to set up a timeshare plan?\nSpongeBob: Don't do it, Sandy!\nSandy: I won't give in to your timeshare vacation scam!\nMaster Udon: Then give into my fists.\nSandy: You're in the soup now, Udon!\nSpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sorry I acted like a jerk back there. Thanks for saving me from...  buying a condo.\nSandy: Aw, shucks, SpongeBob, that's what friends are for.\nSpongeBob: I still have one question, though. Does this mean I'm not King of Karate anymore?\nSandy: You are in my book, SpongeBob. You are in my book. Now let me tell you about real estate. It's all about location...\nSquidward: I'm here! The King of Clarinets has arrived!\n","72a\nAll That Glitters\nCustomer: One monster Krabby Patty, please.\nSquidward: Hmph, no one's ordered the monster Krabby Patty in ages.

Monster Krabby Patty?!\nCustomers: Monster Krabby Patty?!\nCustomer #2: Monster Krabby Patty?!\nSpongeBob: Oh, dear Neptune.\nSquidward: Oh, boy.\nSpongeBob: We can do this.

How can I go back to work without... without Spat?!\nMr. Krabs: Use another spatular.\nSpongeBob: WHAT?! There is only one spatula for me, and that is Spat. Spat, wait up! Spat!  I'm coming, Spat!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Spat, we've been through so much together.\nDoctor: There\u2019s no easy way to say this. SpongeBob, if I were you, I would give serious consideration to start thinking about a replacement spatula.\nDoctor: Go home. Get some rest. We\u2019ll try to do everything we can.\nSpongeBob: Thank you, Doctor.\nDoctor: Oh, I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor who\u2019s searching for a role. Yes! Woohoo! I am so totally gonna get this part.\nSpongeBob: Replacement spatula? How can anything ever replace... HEY! Look at that!\nSpongeBob: Ooh. Looks fancy. So shiny. All those lines so sleek. What am I talking about? I don't need this.  Maybe I do need this.\nDoctor: I would give serious consideration to...  a replacement spatula.\nSpongeBob: OW!\nEmployee: Uh-uh! No touchy-touchy the Le Spatula! It is very, very expensive.\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry.\nEmployee: Of course, if you purchase this fine item, you may... hold it.\nSpongeBob: I've got some loose change in my pocket, will this cover it?\nEmployee: Umm...  ...no.\nSpongeBob: How about now?\nEmployee: No.\nSpongeBob: Now?\nEmployee: No.\nSpongeBob: Now?\nEmployee: No.\nSpongeBob: Now?\nEmployee: No.\nSpongeBob: Now?\nEmployee: No.\nSpongeBob: Now?\nEmployee: No.\nSpongeBob: That's everything I have.

Ooh, breezy today.\nSquidward: Nice outfit, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. It was worth every penny.\nMr. Krabs: What\u2019s all the lallygagging about?\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, get a load of SpongeBob.\nMr. Krabs: This better be good.\nSpongeBob: Soon, everyone will know of your beauty.\nMr. Krabs: Alright, what's going on in  ...ooh... Don't you have any shame, boy?\nSpongeBob: All my shame went into here, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Le Spatular! What in blazes is that?\nSpongeBob: Oh, just the answer to our little production dilemma.\nMr. Krabs: Well, what can it do?\nSquidward: Can it make me famous?\nSpongeBob: Anything you want and more.\nMr. Krabs: Ooh, that sounds exciting. Let me have a go at it.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs, no can do.\nMr. Krabs: What? Are you going against your commanding officer?\nSpongeBob: No, it's not that. It's just that this is a highly developed piece of engineering that takes quality time to master.\nMr. Krabs: With that fancy machinery, I expect you to make Krabby Patties twice as fast.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, Mr. Krabs. In fact...\nLe Spatula: Le Spatula 3000 at your service!\nMr. Krabs: Huh, impressive. Well, let's see that thing impress me even more by bringing in more customers and more money in me pocket.\nSpongeBob: Oh, you won't believe what Le Spatula is capable of. Ready to show \u2018em, buddy?  Oh, it's okay. No need to be shy. It's always tough the first day on the job.\nMartin: Uh, can I get 1 Krabby Patty, please?\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I need 1 Krabby Patty.\nSpongeBob: 1 Krabby Patty, coming up lickity split.  Spat, is there something wrong, pal?\nLe Spatula: I would not dare touch such slop as this, how you say, Krabby Patty. I am designed for the up most interesting cuisine. No less!\nSpongeBob: But, but, I thought we were friends.\nLe Spatula: Friends with you?! Ha! We are not even in the same social class.  Have a nice life of mediocrity, fry cook!\nSpongeBob: Le Spatula, wait. I gave up everything for you. We had something.\nLe Spatula: How\u2019s that for something? Au revoir, peasants! Have fun laboring in your greasy spoon.\nMr. Krabs: What happened?\nSpongeBob: Le Spatula is gone, Mr. Krabs.\nMr Krabs: Well, how are you gonna make Krabby Patties WITHOUT A SPATULAR?!\nSpongeBob: I had a spatula once. A real spatula. One that stood by me through thick and thin, through grease and gristle, and I betrayed his loyalty, like a fool!\nMr. Krabs: I always did like your old spatular. It got the job done every time.\nSpongeBob: You're right, Mr. Krabs. The true measure of a good spatula is by his actions. Not by some fancy chrome and buttons. I gotta find my old spatula.\nMr. Krabs: Go to em. Go now, boy. Go before I lose all me customers.\nSpongeBob: Spatula? It can't be true. It's too late!\nDoctor: SpongeBob, I hate to tell you this...\nSpongeBob: I know. He's moved on to the big kitchen drawer in the sky. He's gone!\nDoctor: Actually, it's not that. I didn't get the acting part.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I'm so sorry.\nDoctor: Oh, by the way, that's not your spatula. Your buddy's all patched up in the infirmary.\nSpongeBob: Spatula!  Oh, buddy! Oh, I'm so glad you're better!  Spatula, what's wrong?  But I didn't mean to betray you. Mr Krabs needed a replacement. Krabby Patties don't flip themselves, you know. It was a moment of weakness. I'm sorry! Oh, what have I done?! What have I done?!\nSpongeBob: : All that glitters is not gold.\nSpongeBob: Goodbye, best friend!\nSpongeBob: I'll never find another spatula like him again.  Spatula? You're back!  Oh, spatula, now that we're together again, nothing will ever separate us.\nSquidward: One monster Krabby Patty.\nSpongeBob: Okay, buddy, we can do this. Ready? 1, 2, 3.  D'oh!\n","72b\nWishing You Well\nMr. Krabs: Nothing. Oh well.  That sounds like a quarter crying for help.  Come to papa!\nMartha Smith: Hold it right there, buddy! My son just dropped that quarter.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah? Well that kid looks pretty shifty to me. How do I know he didn't steal it?  Hey! That little brat is throwing perfectly good money away! Oh, so if I can't have it, no one...  I hope he throws all your retirement money down a hole!  Poor little quarter. What the...? This well is full of money! Don't worry little fellas, I'll save you!  Oh, it's no use. Me poop deck's too big.\nDebbie: Make a wish, dear.\nHarold: All my wishes have already come true.\nDebbie: Oh you.\nMr. Krabs: No!  I'll save ya, money!  Gotcha. What do you heartless brutes think you're doing?\nHarold: Umm, using the wishing well.\nDebbie: You toss in a coin and make a wish.\nMr. Krabs: And then what?\nHarold: And... that's it. Nothing else happens.\nDebbie: It's fun!\nMr. Krabs: You mean suckers throw in money down a hole for fun? That's the greatest scam ever.\nHarold: Can we have our quarter back now?\nSquidward: SpongeBob, why aren't those patties ready?\nSpongeBob: You can't rush perfection.\nSquidward: I'm not rushing perfection. I'm rushing you.\nSpongeBob: Always the kidder, Squidward.\nSquidward: Oh, this job stinks! But at least I'm not digging ditches.\nMr. Krabs: Squidward, SpongeBob, I got a new job for ya.  X marks the spot of the Eugene Krabs Memorial Wishing Well.\nSpongeBob: A wishing well, here? Wow!\nSquidward: Don't you have to be dead to have a memorial anything?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, Squidward, don't you believe in magic?\nSquidward: No, I don't, and neither does Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Well, I do. This well's gonna make a lot of dreams come true.  What's the first thing you're gonna wish for?\nSquidward: To be far away from you as possible. C'mon, SpongeBob, this hole's not gonna dig itself. And I'm certainly not gonna do it.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, aren't you excited? This is really gonna help people. \u266aTake a penny and some magic, even though your life is tragic...\u266a\nSquidward: Hey!\nSpongeBob: \u266a...you can throw all your dreams down the well. Although everyday the pain grows you ride unicorns on rainbows, if you throw all your dreams down the well. When your life's come apart at the seams and you've given up all your dreams, here is just the means to make those dreams come true. No more suffering, no more sighin', no more pain and no more cryin'.\u266a\nSquidward: I'm not cryin'!  Ow. Ow.\nSpongeBob: \u266aWhen you throw all your dreams down the well.\u266a  Well, Squidward, what do you think?\nSquidward: That was the worst song I ever heard. But at least this stupid well's finished.\nMr. Krabs: It's beautiful.  You smell that, boys? That's the smell of money.\nSpongeBob: You mean magic, don't ya?\nSquidward: All I can smell is that dumpster.\nMr. Krabs: All right, Squidward, you can go back to the register.\nSquidward: As long as there's no singing.\nSpongeBob: And I've got a date with a Krabby Patty.\nMr. Krabs: Hold on there, SpongeBob. Let me show you your new station. It's kind of a promotion. Sorta.\nSpongeBob: A promotion?  Why do I have to go down in the well?\nMr. Krabs: To collect the money!\nSpongeBob: How long do I have to stay down here?\nMr. Krabs: See ya in 8 hours.\nSpongeBob: Thanks for the promotion. It sure is dark and scary down here.\nSandy: I sure wish I had a fancy telescope. One that works underwater. That'd make me happier than a junebug at a porch light sale.\nSpongeBob: Our very first wish! I can't wait till it comes...\nPlankton: I have presented you with a monetary offering as custom dictates. My wish, n\xe9e my command, is to be taller. Just a little? Just big enough to crush my enemies, like the vermin they are!\nSpongeBob: Gosh...  Ow!\nMrs. Puff: I wish I had a snazzy new boat. I wanna be a hot rod momma.\nSpongeBob: Hey!\nPatrick: Oh my gosh. Who said that?\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\nPatrick: How do you know my name?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, this is a wishing well. Just throw in a coin and make a wish.\nPatrick: Okay, magical talking trashcan.  I wish SpongeBob were here to see this.\nSpongeBob: Patrick.\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob! I got my wish.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're supposed to let go of the coin when you throw it.\nPatrick: But I got my wish.\nSpongeBob: Well, we've got 6\xbd hours \u2018til the end of my shift. What do you want to do now?\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what kind of haul did you get?\nSpongeBob: I did great, Mr Krabs. I got a nickel from Sandy, 2 pennies from Mrs. Puff, a penny from Plankton...  ...and this slightly used pair of dentures.\nPatrick: And I fell on my head.\nMr. Krabs: Well, I could probably get a couple of bucks for Patrick. Nah. You better just hand up the money.\nSpongeBob: This wishing well was a wonderful idea, Mr. Krabs. Has anyone's wish come true, yet?\nMr. Krabs: Uhh, not yet. But I'm sure if you believe strong enough, and dug deep enough, everyone's wishes will come true.\nSpongeBob: Really?\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, sure, whatever.\nSpongeBob: Can we come out now?\nMr. Krabs: Goodness, no. You gotta stay down there just in case any late-night wishers come by. I'll be back for ya at dawn.\nSpongeBob: Aww, no one's wishes are coming true. What did we do wrong? I know I believe hard enough. Maybe I just didn't dig deep enough. What do you say, Patrick? Are you ready to dig for some magic?\nPatrick: Yeah.\nSpongeBob: \u266aOh, the magic has gone missin' and everyone's still wishin' but their dreams have fallen flat upon the ground. You'll find magic under rubble so, Patrick, grab a shovel and here is where the magic can be found. We're at the bottom of a well but man won't it be swell, when we make everyone's wishes all come true.\u266a  Holy mackerel, look, Patrick! We've struck magic.\nPatrick: Is that good?\nSpongeBob: Next to being a fry cook, it's the most important thing I've ever done.\nPatrick: It's the only thing I've ever done.\nSquidward: Having fun down there, SpongeBob?\nPatrick: Hi, Squidward.\nSquidward: Patrick's down there, too? It just gets better and better.\nSpongeBob: Do you wanna make a wish?\nSquidward: I got my wish. You two are stuck in a dark hole and away from me.\nSpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? We found the magic.\nSquidward: There's no magic, SpongeBob. Wishing wells are just a scam to fool saps like you.\nSpongeBob: No, it's true! We did find the magic. Oh, I wish you could see it.  Squidward! You decided to join the party.\nPatrick: Party!\nSquidward: Let me out of here.\nSpongeBob: We were just gonna play some party games.\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\nSpongeBob: Tag, you're it.\nPatrick: Tag, you're it.\nSquidward: I gotta get out of here.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Go Squidward! Go Squidward!\nSquidward: There's no way to climb out of here.\nSpongeBob: Maybe if you had more upper arm strength.\nPatrick: Yeah, you should work out more.\nSquidward: Well, why don't I just start right now? After all, I got a couple of dumbbells right here.\nPatrick: I don't get it.\nSquidward: Could you not stand so close? You're making me claustrophobic.\nPatrick: What does claustrophobic mean?\nSpongeBob: It means he's afraid of Santa Claus.\nSquidward: No, it doesn't.\nPatrick: Ho, ho, ho!\nSpongeBob: Stop it, Patrick, you're scaring him!\nPatrick: Ho, ho, ho!\nSquidward: It's not working, Patrick.\nPatrick: Darn.\nSpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, you're standing on my foot.\nSquidward: Oh, sorry, SpongeBob.\nPatrick: And you got your elbow in my ribs.\nSquidward: Eww. Patrick!\nPatrick: And stop stepping in my potato salad.\nSpongeBob: Hey, hey, hey, guys.\nSquidward: Stop pushing me, Patrick.\nPatrick: Oh, you mean like this?\nSquidward: No, like this!\nSpongeBob: You shouldn't fight in here. This is a magical place.\nSquidward: Patrick, get off of me!  I told you I am claustrophobic!\nPatrick: Nice try, Squidward, but there's no Santa Claus here.\nSquidward: Patrick!\nMr. Krabs: Good morning, SpongeBob! Let's see what ya got.  Boy, it's heavy. Must be a lot of money.\nSquidward: Free. I'm free!\nMr. Krabs: Squidward? What were you doing down there? I didn't approve of the overtime. Or were you sneaking here in the dead of night for free wishes?\nSquidward: The only thing I wish for is to be far away from here.  Ow.\nSpongeBob: Bye, Squidward. Enjoy your trip!\nPatrick: Lucky.\nMr. Krabs: So how much money did you make last night?\nSpongeBob: We didn't get any money. But we found something better. We found the magic.\nMr. Krabs: The what?\nSpongeBob: We dug down deeper in the well and found the magic. Now all the wishes will come true!\nMr. Krabs: Listen closely, SpongeBob. You don't get what you want in life just by wishing for it.  What in the deep blue is that?\nSandy: There's a full moon out tonight. Do you like my new telescope I wished for?\nSpongeBob: That's great, Sandy!\nSandy: That wishing well sure does work.\nMr. Krabs: Just a coincidence.\nMrs. Puff: What do you think of my new hot rod?\nSpongeBob: It's beautiful, Mrs. Puff. How's about letting me take it for a spin?\nMrs. Puff: No.\nSpongeBob: See, Mr. Krabs? She wished for that boat.\nMr. Krabs: You mean she stole that boat.\nPlankton: Morning, SpongeBob. Krabs. Beautiful day.\nSpongeBob: Is that proof enough for ya?\nMr. Krabs: You'll never get me to believe in magic, never! Just to prove it to ya.  I'll demonstrate. I wish... I was steamed and served with a side of melted butter.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! No!\nMr. Krabs: Well, where's your magic now?  Oh, where am I? What's going on here?  Uh-oh. I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! I do believe in magic! Oh no!\n","73a\nNew Leaf\nPlankton: I surrender!\nMr. Krabs: Eh? I wonder what form of trickery is up that miniature cyclops' sleeve this time.  Alright, Plankton, I don't know what you're trying to pull on me, but I'll tell ya right now, it ain't going to work.\nPlankton: There's no pulling, Krabs. Can't you see my peace offering?\nMr. Krabs: What is this?  Ha-ha! Very funny, Plankton! But you're gonna have to do a lot better than taking a stab at my illiteracy to offend me.\nPlankton: Don't you get it, Krabs? I give up. I'm through competing with you!\nMr. Krabs: But what about all those fevered attempts at trying to steal my Krabby Patty recipe?\nPlankton: Exactly! They've all been just attempts. And every single one a miserable failure. I can feel my arteries clogging up with anxiety just thinking about it.  Let me show you something.  Look at this place!\nMr. Krabs: Criminy, Plankton, you ever heard of spring cleaning?\nPlankton: What's the point? Do you know when the last time I had a customer was?\nMr. Krabs: Actually, I don't recall you ever having a customer.\nPlankton: Well, there he is.  That's why I've decided to quit the restaurant business altogether, and turn the Chum Bucket into...  this!\nMr. Krabs: You want to turn your restaurant into a pile of junk?\nPlankton: No! These are knickknacks for the new gift shop I'm opening up.\nMr. Krabs: Come on, this has got to be a joke, right?\nPlankton: I'm serious, Krabs. Soon, the Chum Bucket will be a nice little store for bric-a-brac and bubblegum.\nMr. Krabs: All right, Plankton. But be aware, I'm not letting my guard down.\nPlankton: Guard away, my ex-enemy. I'll just be here starting my new competition-free career.\nSpongeBob: What's going on Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Plankton's concocting another hair-brained scheme to steal me recipe. So keep your eyes peeled.\nSpongeBob: Whatever you say, cap'n.\nMr. Krabs: Now that's an employee who follows orders.  What in blazes is that noise?\nPlankton: Ah, would you look at that? I have a feeling I'm going to like this new life of novelty items.\nMr. Krabs: Uh-huh. Clever, Plankton! Two can play at this game.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, look at this cool knickknack I got at the Chumporium.\nMr. Krabs: Hmm, I know there's a microphone or camera in here somewhere.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Mr. Krabs, I really don't think there's anything weird in there.\nMr. Krabs: Eh, we'll see about that.  I'll just put this in here for safekeeping. You here that, Plankton?! Join your other friends from the past.  Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he can take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf.\nSpongeBob: That's some good news, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: It sure is, you little half-wit. And you know what else is good news? We can finally use that DJ system. Hit it, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Right away, sir.\nMr. Krabs: Let's party!  Ow! I won! It's time to boogie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!\nSquidward: This is idiotic.\nMr. Krabs: Dance or you're fired.\nSquidward: You got it, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: How do you like them apples, you little...\nPlankton: Come on, buddy, let's get some shut eye. We have a big day ahead of us at the Chumporium Gift Shop.\nMr. Krabs: Wait a minute.  What the...?  Store shelves? Novelty toys? Lava lamps?  Useless knickknacks? Very convincing. But I'm still not buying it. You want a battle, Plankton? I'm gonna give you a war.\nPlankton: Ah. A clean snow globe is a happy snow globe.\nMr. Krabs: Plankton! You may have fooled everyone else, you might have even fooled yourself, but you ain't fooling me.\nPlankton: Oh, I get it. You caught me red-handed.  Those were the days, huh Eugene?\nMr. Krabs: Grr...\nPlankton: But I found there more to life than just trying to steal your formula. And I found it all right here in novelty items.\nMr. Krabs: Bubkes.\nPlankton: Ah, Eugene. Stuck in your old ways.\nMr. Krabs: Bubkes! If there's one thing certain in this world, it's that you can't resist me formula.  You know you want it.\nPlankton: Thanks, but no.\nMr. Krabs: A-ha, I knew it.  It was all a trick to get me to hand over... Wait, did you say no?\nPlankton: Well, if you don't believe me, that's your problem not mine.\nMr. Krabs: Problem?! I don't have a problem! You're the one with the problem! Look at this. It means nothing. It's all a facade, a hoax, a con, a front...  ...a sham, a snow job...  ...bologna with a side of flimflam and an order of Jive!  See?! Who's the one with the problem?!\nPlankton: Look what you've done. This is my livelihood.\nMr. Krabs: Sure it is. And this isn't the formula that you don't want. Come on, eh? Eh? Oop. Too slow.\nPlankton: Get out!\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I get it. Stick to your guns, and eventually we'll all believe it. Soften us up and when our backs are turned, you'll make your move.  Oops.\nPlankton: What's this?  Hey, Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: I knew you'd come back.\nPlankton: You forgot something.  Can't you understand I've wasted so much time chasing after you? And now I have something that's mine. And it makes me happy.\nMr. Krabs: I never thought I'd see the day. What happened to the invertebrate I used to know? Plankton!\nPlankton: Coming, coming.  Yo.\nMr. Krabs: Uh, Plankton?\nPlankton: Eugene?\nMr. Krabs: Uh, hey.\nPlankton: Hey.\nMr. Krabs: Listen, uh, I just wanted to...you know...apologize for my behavior today. Wasn't right what I done. And I realized I hurt the feelings of, uh, someone I care about. You still there?\nPlankton: Yes. I'm still here.\nMr. Krabs: Heh, good. Uh...I want to make it up to you. What do you say we grab a soda?\nPlankton: Sure.\nMr. Krabs: Glad you could make it, buddy.\nPlankton: So, what's this about, Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I figured since we're no longer archenemies, maybe, maybe we can start over.\nPlankton: Yes. Yes, I would like that very much.  I guess I won.\nMr. Krabs: Uh, I don't know about this, Plankton.\nPlankton: Oh, come on. Just fall back. Trust me, I'll catch you.\nMr. Krabs: That was truly amazing, Plank, old buddy. I guess I really can trust you 100%.\nPlankton: Thanks, Eugene. That means a lot to me.\nMr. Krabs: And just to prove it to you, I want you to have something.\nPlankton: Oh, no, no, come on now. No gifts.\nMr. Krabs: No, no. I want you to have this. It's the secret formula.\nPlankton: I can't believe you would even think...\nMr. Krabs: Things are different now. Honestly. It would mean a lot to me.\nPlankton: You...you're serious. Eugene, if I take this formula from you now, there will always be a hint of doubt.\nMr. Krabs: Come on, take it.\nPlankton: You sure?  Life is good, Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Sure is, buddy. Sure is.\nPlankton: Yeah, baby! This is it. Yeah! Whoo!  I got it! I got it! My diabolical, extremely convoluted plan worked! I should've been a politician.\nMr. Krabs: I never gave you the formula. I fooled you with an even more convoluted charade.\n","73b\nOnce Bitten\nSquidward: What a sun-tastic day!  Snail trail.  That SpongeBob needs to keep his pet out of my yard. I am sick of cleaning up after him.\nGary: Meow.\nSquidward: Not my pet rock collection.  That's it! This isn't the first time you've soiled my yard with your revolting excretions. But mark this down in your little notebook: it will be the last time!  This cheap, splintering wood will keep even Gary out. Now, I feel safe.  SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hi, Squidward.\nSquidward: Hey, SpongeBob...  Keep your shell vermin off of my property! The next time, my annoyingly yellow neighbor, your wet pet oozes on my lawn, you leave me no choice but to call Snail Control. That little monster...  He bit me!\nSpongeBob: Gary! No, dirty boy. This isn't like you.\nSquidward: Oh, but it's just like you, SpongeBob, to raise such a misbehaved mutt.\nSpongeBob: Gary's not misbehaved!\nSpongeBob: But there does appear to be something wrong with him.\nSquidward: I'll say. I hope he had his shots.\nSpongeBob: Oh, of course.\nSquidward: All of his shots?\nSpongeBob: Affirmatory.\nSquidward: For rabies?\nSpongeBob: Yup.\nSquidward: Snail pox and soft shell dance?\nSpongeBob: Yupie.\nSquidward: Bronchitis, lumpy-bump trump, teen angst?\nSpongeBob: Yup, yup, yup.\nPatrick: Well, let's not forget the worst of them all: Mad Snail Disease.\nSpongeBob: Uhh...\nPatrick: You mean your pet hasn't been vaccinated for mad snail disease?  Looks like the rash has already started.\nSquidward: Rash?\nPatrick: Tell me, do you have any soreness of throat?\nSquidward: Well, now that you mention it, my throat is a little dry.\nPatrick: This disease will ravage your body with bloodshot eyes, loss of balance, messy pants, ticklish rib cage, severely untrimmed toenails, and finally, the bite from that infected snail will turn you into... A zombie.\nPatrick: You need to get that snail of yours to a doctor before he bites someone important.  There's a mad snail on the loose!\nSpongeBob: Gary? Gary?! Gary?! Gary?!\nPatrick: That mad snail is coming! If he bites you, you'll turn into a zombie.\nFish: Jeepers, what's with all the lunatics?\nFish's Wife: Oh look, honey, isn't he the cutest?\nFish: Come here, little buddy.  He's just adorable.  Mad snail disease is real! I'm a zombie. I've been bitten by a mad snail. I've got mad snail disease!\nFish #2: Then I've got it! A snail just bit me, too!\nJohnny: We interrupt this program to bring you a news blast. Terror in a shell. This just in... fear and disease is spreading like wildfire as a killer snail has been biting the citizens of Bikini Bottom infecting them with... mad snail disease.  Ask any old fish on the street and they'll tell you that germs enter through the bite radius, traveling upstream until the entire host body is full of... mad snail disease.  We now take you to Action News Reporter Perch Perkins live on the scene.\nPerch Perkins: Perch Perkins here with the first victim of this epidemic. Tell me Mr Tentacles, when did you first begin to suspect that you were a zombie?\nSquidward: Well, after I was bitten by a mad snail, I began to get a rash; followed by loss of balance, ticklish rib cage, and a few other symptoms.\nFrank: Hey, I was bitten by a snail. I kinda feel off balance.  Whoa.\nPerch Perkins: Hey, I have a ticklish rib cage, too. And I haven't even been bitten.\nFrank: Oh no, it's spreading through the air!\nPerch Perkins: Well, you heard it here first. We're all doomed to a horrible demise. Thanks to a diseased snail.\nSpongeBob: Gary?  I can't believe that sweet and slimy snail would cause all this destruction.\nSquidward: I'm a zombie, here to dine on your squishy yellow flesh.  It's locked!  Somebody let me in.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come in, boy. And bring your friends in, too. They look hungry.\nFrank: Stop! You can't let anyone in!\nMr. Krabs: But they just want to dine on some Krabby Patties.\nFrank: They're zombies. They only want to dine on our flesh.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, alright, but it's coming out of your paycheck.\nFrank: I don't work here.\nSpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs, it's me, SpongeBob.\nMr. Krabs: But how do we know you haven't become one of those voracious flesh-eaters?\nSpongeBob: Could a voracious flesh-eater do this?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, it's you.\nSpongeBob: That's right. So let me in before I'm eaten.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, that's SpongeBob all right.\nPatrick: Or is it?\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nPatrick: I don't believe that's the real SpongeBob. He looks pretty zombie-fied. Just look at how yellow he is.\nSpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, would a zombie have a picture of his best buddy in his wallet?\nPatrick: Perhaps not. Now, I got my eye on you!\nOld Man Jenkins: If you could pull out your eye and put it on him, wouldn't that make... You a zombie too?\nPatrick: You're right.  I'm a zombie!\nOld Man Jenkins: Who's to say we're not all zombies?!\nGary: Meow.\nAll: The snail!\nSpongeBob: Gary! Are you okay, buddy? Come here, boy.\nHarold: No, don't get near it. Oh, the pity of it all!\nEvelyn: I can't watch.\nSpongeBob: All those people think you're a monster. But I know you're just a snail.  Gary...  How could you?\nHarold: SpongeBob's been infected by his own pet snail. Oh, the irony! Quick, we must quarantine that infected snail before he bites every last Bikini Bottomite. Let's get the snail!\nAll: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: No, don't hurt him.\nHarold: Hand over the snail.\nMr. Krabs: It's... for his own good, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: No, I won't let you touch Gary.\nHarold: Stop the madness, man. The Mad Snail Disease ends now. Seize the snail!\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Halt! Did someone say 'Mad Snail Disease'? Is that what all this fuss is about?\nPatrick: Yeah. What do you know about it?\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Funny you should ask. Allow me to introduce myself. Doctor Gill Gilliam. S.D.E. and S.E.\nSpongeBob: S.D.E. and S.E.?\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Snail disease expert and snail expert. I'm sorry to break this to you all, but that 'mad snail disease' you're talking about, it doesn't exist.\nAll: Huh?\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: That's right. No such thing. It's an old urban legend. A myth.\nPatrick: Well, does that mean we're not zombies?\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Of course not. No one is. It's just mass hysteria.\nNathiel: But what about my severely untrimmed...\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Those are only moderately untrimmed. All the supposed symptoms are just common ailments.\nSpongeBob: Easy, boy. But what about Gary then? If he doesn't have a disease, why'd he bite all those people, including me?\nDoctor Gill Gilliam: Hmmm... mm-hmm. Ahh! The problem's right here. He's got a little splinter in his foot.  I'm sure this was the cause of his distemper making for serious grouchy snailitis.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I knew you weren't disease-ridden. You still love me?\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Good ol' Gary's back.  Squidward? You're not a zombie, remember?\nSquidward: Oh, yes I am.  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I take your order?\nMr. Krabs: All's well that ends well.\nMr. Krabs: Ow!\n","74a\nBummer Vacation\nMr. Krabs: Squidward! SpongeBob! Just put me out of my misery.\nSpongeBob: Why, Mr. Krabs? What could be wrong on this fine day?\nMr. Krabs: Fine?!  Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union. It says here fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants has accumulated too much vacation time. And if you don't take some time off, I'll have to pay a fine.\nSpongeBob: Time off?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I guess there's no other way to say this...SpongeBob, take a vacation.\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Well, that went better than expected.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready, vacation. I'm ready, vacation. Vacation. Vacation.  Hey, Gary.\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: That's right, Gary, I am home early. I'm on vacation. Well, good night, Gary.  Good morning, Krusty Krew! Hello, Squidward.\nSquidward: I thought you were on vacation.\nMr. Krabs: He was and is. I told you to take a vacation, boy.\nSpongeBob: What's a vacation?\nMr. Krabs: Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work.\nSpongeBob: No work?! But what'll I do all day?\nMr. Krabs: Oh, I dunno. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. Ya just can't be here.\nSpongeBob: But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone.\nSquidward: Nor will I.\nMr. Krabs: That's why I've hired an unpaid intern as your temporary replacement.\nPatrick: Good morning, boss. I'm ready for my first day.\nMr. Krabs: Speaking of starfish, here's your replacement right here.\nSpongeBob: Replacement?\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nMr. Krabs: That's enough banter on my dime.\nPatrick: Ok, boss.\nMr. Krabs: Wait a second, Patrick. You'll need the right tools for the job.\nPatrick: Wow.  Huh! They put a tiny me in the belly scratcher.  Wow. It scratches backs, too!\nMr. Krabs: Ah, take it from me, SpongeBob. Just go on home. Enjoy your vacation.\nSpongeBob: I really should tell Patrick the proper patty-flipping technique.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I'm on vacation, Gary. I'm not allowed to go to work.  My stomach has receded! Mr. Krabs said I couldn't work at the Krusty Krab. He didn't say I couldn't eat there. This is my ticket back inside!\nSquidward: Go away, SpongeBob. You're ruining my vacation...from you.\nSpongeBob: I'm not here to see you, Squidward.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, do we have to go through this again?\nSpongeBob: I'm here as a customer not as an employee. Just gonna grab a Krabby Patty with Patrick for lunch.\nMr. Krabs: Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davey Jones' locker.\nSpongeBob: You have my word, sir. No working.  Hey, Pat, it's time for your lunch...  Patrick, you can't do that!\nPatrick: Huh?\nSpongeBob: You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit.  Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What did I tell you about working?\nSpongeBob: Wait, it's not what you think.\nMr. Krabs: Out you go, boy.\nSpongeBob: But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs: We've got it all under control here. I don't want to see hide or tail of ya 'til your vacation is over. You got that?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Well, boy...  off ya go! And don't come back 'til it's over.\nSpongeBob: Oh, what to do, what to do. I know just the thing to get the spirits up. The official Krusty Krab playset.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I need 20 Krabby Patties on the double, please.\nSpongeBob: Sure thing, Mr. Squidward, sir. 20 Krabby Patties coming up.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what are you doing here? You're gonna cost me some loot if you don't get your square keister home. Out, out, out until your vacation is over.\nSpongeBob: Oh, what to do on this boring vacation. Hey, I know just the thing to get the ol' spirits up.\nSquidward: I need 20 Krabby Patties, please.\nSpongeBob: Sure thing, ol' buddy, ol' Squid. 20 Krabby Patties coming...\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: You're right, Gary. It is unhealthy to think of the Krusty Krab while I'm on vacation. I need to get out of the house.\nSquidward: Uh, Mr. Krabs, he's out there again.\nMr. Krabs: I'll deal with this. Boy, you're on Krusty Krab property. Back it up.  Further.  Further.  Further.  Further.  That'll do.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally.  Hey, that reminds me of...  Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax.  That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds.  That one's a jellyfish!  That's a pirate ship.  And that's low salt ketchup...whoa! Low salt ketchup?  Got your steaming, hot bun delivery here.\nDelivery Fish: Huh? What's the big idea, here?\nPatrick: Hello? Hello? Hello?  Huh, I didn't even know I had an ear.  Hey, I just cleaned that one.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, shhh.\nPatrick: It talks!\nSpongeBob: Somebody help, I'm stuck!  Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.  Um, Mr. Krabs?  Noooo!!  Uh oh.\nMr. Krabs: Now what?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  I've had enough for one day, son.\nSpongeBob: Thanks for the ride home, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Not a problem at all, me boy.\nSpongeBob: Just take the next right.  Mr. Krabs, we just passed the turn off.\nMr. Krabs: Uh-huh.\nSpongeBob: My house is back that way, Mr. K.\nMr. Krabs: Far out, little man. Far out.\nSpongeBob: Where'd you say you were taking me?\nMr. Krabs: Look, boy,  I brought your spatuler.  C'mon, boy, get it. Get the spatuler. Go get it!  Enjoy your vacation, boy!\nSpongeBob: It's not fair. Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me? I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a...  ...permanent vacation! That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known! Patrick's had his eye on my job all along! He's been scheming! They think I'm outdated! They think I'm all washed up! Well, I'll show them!\nPatrick: Working at the Krusty Krab. Making Krabby Patties all day. Flipping Krusty Krab working patties krab...uhh, that's a hard song to remember.  Huh?\nSpongeBob: Who do they think they are? I gave the best years of my life to this place and they think they can just fire like that? Like trash? I don't think so!\nPatrick: SpongeBob? Is that you?\nSpongeBob: I've been waiting for you, Patrick!\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you're scaring me. Ahh!\nSquidward: What\u2019ll be?\nCustomer: One Krabby Patty, please.\nSquidward: One shell on a shingle.\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'll be...Patrick! Your cooking's improved one-thousand fold. Congratulations, boy, you've finally got the hang of it.  SpongeBob? No wonder. Patrick could never flip that many patties in an hour. What happened to that feller, anyway?\nSpongeBob: Oh, I told him to stay home and watch television.\nMr. Krabs: Why'd you do it, laddy?\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr Krabs, I love the putrid grease of the Krusty Krab so much, I just couldn't stay away!\nMr. Krabs: You don't have to.  Your accumulated vacation time is used up.  The union can't fine me, anymore.\nSpongeBob: You must've saved a fortune.\nMr. Krabs: Bumping barnacles, yes.  There she is.\nSpongeBob: Wow! That's more than I make in a year.\nMr. Krabs: Don't be askin me for a raise. Just get back to work.\nSpongeBob: Yippee! I happily acquiesce.\n","74b\nWigstruck\nBand Member #1: Man, this is gonna be our most rocking tour, ever.\nBand Member #2: Yeah.\nNed: Hey, dudes, check out the debut of my new look.\nBand Member #1: Whoa, what's that on your head?\nBand Member #3: Yeah, is that a wig or a pile of toilet paper?\nNed: C'mon, guys, give it a chance.\nBand Member #2: Let me try it on.\nNed: Hey, you've revealed my shiny dome!\nBand Member #2: Hot potato.

Ah, what is this? Curly tresses, poofy texture,  itchy scalp...  it's a wig!  Hi, Patrick. How do you like my new wig?\nPatrick: I'll save you.\nSpongeBob: Pa... trick... what are... you doing?\nPatrick: I'm saving you from that brain-eating alien that's attacking your...  ...head!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, the only thing attacking me is you!\nPatrick: Oh, sorry.\nSpongeBob: It's okay.  Why did you do that?\nPatrick: Well, I thought it was a new type of cotton candy you wear on your head.\nSpongeBob: Well, it's not, but that is an excellent idea.\nPatrick: Then what is it?\nSpongeBob: It's my new look. I'm wearing a wig.\nPatrick: A wig?  Oh, boy. Don't you think that's a little silly?  Oh, man, it's time for my weekly condiment soak.  Do you mind?\nFish #1: Nice wig.\nSpongeBob: Thanks. I am very fashionable today.\nTina: Hey, SquareFashion, nice couture.\nSpongeBob: Why, thank you.\nPilar: So then...  Huh...?\nPeterson: Nice do, SpongeBob.\nPilar: Yeah, where can I get one?\nSally: Whoa. That wig really suits you.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Squidward!\nSquidward: Who? What? Where? What? How?\nSpongeBob: Notice anything different about me today, Squidward? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? ...Huh?\nSquidward: Nope.\nSpongeBob: I'm wearing a wig.\nSquidward: Oh yeah, how could I have missed it?\nSpongeBob: Can you believe I found it lying around in the street?\nSquidward: Umm...maybe.\nSpongeBob: If you want to, after work, we can go look for a wig for you.\nSquidward: I can't wait.\nSpongeBob: Wig away!  Order up, Squidward.\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs!  I've served a lot of junk here, but a hair patty?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: What in Davy Jones' locker is on your head, son?\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's my new wig, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Well, take it off. The hair's getting into the patties.\nSpongeBob: Take it off? But I can't, Mr. Krabs. My wig makes everyone so happy.\nMr. Krabs: Happy?\nSpongeBob: Ever since I've been wearing it, everyone I see gets a big grin on their face.\nMr. Krabs: I can imagine.\nSpongeBob: Oh, please let me keep it, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Well, if it means that much to ya, you can keep it. But you gotta wear a hairnet.  And if I see one more hairy patty, your wig goes in the dumpster.\nSandy: There you are, SpongeBob. Are you ready for karate prac...tice?\nSpongeBob: I see you've noticed my new wig. Pretty impressive, huh?\nSandy: Wig's... uh great...SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Glad you like it.  I'll see you later, Sandy.  Two krabby patties and a side order of looking good.\nFrank: Nice wig.\nAbigail: Like to keep in style, huh?\nSpongeBob: You know it.\nFrancis: Off to meet the queen, Sir Nerdlaroy?\nSpongeBob: Uh, the name's SpongeBob and no, I am not meeting royalty. You must be referring to my regal appearance.  Thank you all for your kind words. I wish I could give you such nice wigs.\nJimmy: How 'bout a little off the top?\nTom: Yeah, your wig is big enough to go around.\nSpongeBob: This isn't good. Everyone's getting jealous.  Squidward, I'll be hiding in the kitchen if you need me.\nSquidward: Hide your shame, SpongeBob. Hide your shame.\nRecord Producer: Well, well, well, Ned and the Needlefish. You're fired.\nBand: Fired?!\nBand Member #2: But why?\nRecord Producer: Ask Baldy McBalderson over here.\nBand: Ned!\nBand Member #2: Good going, dude.\nNed: I can't help not having hair!\nBand Member #3: When we formed this band, it was for one reason and one reason only: to make a lot of money. And you not having hair is getting in the way of that!\nRecord Producer: We are selling records, not denture cream!  Either you come back with hair, or don't come back at all!\nMr. Krabs: Time to go home, boys.\nSpongeBob: Almost finished.  See, Squidward, it's functional, too.\nSquidward: It's about as functional as your brain.\nSpongeBob: Thank you, Squidward.\nSquidward: That wasn't a compliment! The entire town is laughing at you!\nSpongeBob: I don't understand.\nSquidward: Just look at yourself.\nSpongeBob: Hello, handsome.  Sss.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, your head is twice as large as before.\nSpongeBob: Hmmm, I've never been tall before.\nSquidward: That wig is infested with parasites.\nSpongeBob: That tickles.\nSquidward: Can't you see how ridiculous you look?\nSpongeBob: I think that it looks cool.\nMr. Krabs: Hahahaha. You wouldn't know cool if I locked you in the freezer.\nSpongeBob: For your information, Mr. Krabs, Squidward has locked me in the freezer, so I think I know what cool is.\nMr. Krabs: Well, stop wearing that nasty thing to work.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...\nMr. Krabs: No buts.\nSpongeBob: So I can't have a wig or a butt?\nMr. Krabs: No, SpongeBob, it means until you get rid of that wig. Get your butt out of here!\nSandy: I never got a chance to talk to SpongeBob yesterday. I was laughing too hard.  SpongeBob? Huh?\nSpongeBob: Hi, Sandy. What do you think?\nSandy: We need to talk.\nSpongeBob: Why would I want to get rid of my wig? Look at how happy it makes everybody.\nSandy: Well, it does attract a lot of attention.\nSpongeBob: I know. People just can't keep their eyes off of me.\nSandy: Neither can I, SpongeBob.\nMartha: It's true, John, this isn't my real hair! I stole it!\nSpongeBob: Oops. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.  and SpongeBob trips over it. SpongeBob gets his wig stuck in some cheese on the floor. Get sunstuck but a soda is still in the wig Hey, the wig broke my fall!  Mmm, popcorn.  Ah, you always come through for me.\nDale: Hey buddy, do you mind?\nSpongeBob: Shhh! It's very rude to talk during a movie!\nSandy: Umm, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: You, too, Sandy. People are trying to watch the movie.\nSandy: Well, they can't. Look, your stupid wig is blocking the whole screen.\nAll: Fish #1: Take it off, Jerk!; Fish #2: Hey!; Fish #3: Hey! Down in front!; Fish #4: Take the wig off!\nSpongeBob: People, return your attention to the movie. I know my wig is glamorous and exciting but there is no need to start a riot.\nScooter: That's a great idea! Let's start a riot.\nFrank: I told you that movie was terrible.\nSandy: Now do you see what I'm saying, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I guess you're right, Sandy. I got so much enjoyment out of the wig, myself, I assumed everyone else did, too.\nSandy: It's time to be strong.\nSpongeBob: I know.  I just want you to know that even though I didn't know you existed a few days ago, I can't imagine life without you!\nSandy: Hurry up, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: No matter what they say, you'll always be cool to me.  I'll never accessorize again.\nSandy: You did the right thing, SpongeBob.\nNed: Where am I gonna get some hair? My career is ruined. Ruined!  Can it be? It is! My wig. Yes! Victory is mine.\nSpongeBob: Wigs. Wigs, wigs, they're everywhere.\nDebbie: Oh, he's got your hair.\nShubie: Thank you.\nPatrick: SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Patrick! At least he's not wearing a wig.\nPatrick: Look at my new wig.\nSpongeBob: Everyone's wearing wigs! Everyone! I'm starting to feel a little betrayed. Hey, you made fun of me yesterday. I thought powdered wigs were uncool.\nFish #1: Yeah, they were. But look...\nSpongeBob: Wow. Ned and the Needlefish wearing my wig. So, I was cool before anyone else?\nFish #1: Yes, you were. But not anymore. See ya!\nSpongeBob: I wish I had a wig.\nPatrick: Don't be sad, SpongeBob. You can borrow one of mine.  Just wash it before you return it.\n","75a\nSquidtastic Voyage\nFrench Narrator: Today,  we study the gentle of rhythm of the sea.\nNarrator: Gentle rhythm!  Oh, never mind.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!\nSpongeBob: Ocean wave.  Tropical breeze.\nPatrick: Whirlpool.\nSpongeBob: Reverse Whirlpool.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, turn that noise off!  This'll get his attention.\nSpongeBob: Oh!  Oh.\nSquidward: Sponge...\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you've swallowed your clarinet again. I'll get it.\nSquidward: No!  No!  Don't...  touch...  me!\nSpongeBob: I'll get a better look.  Mm. It's too dark. This calls for extreme measures.  Got it! Hey, the pointy bit at the end is missing.\nSquidward: It's called a reeeee!\nSpongeBob: What's a  reeeee?\nSquidward: Great.  My reed...  is still...  stuck in my...  throat.  And it's all your fault.\nSpongeBob: There's only one thing to do. We gotta see Sandy.\nSandy: Hmm.  Just as I thought.  You have that pointy bit from the end of your clarinet stuck in your throat. That was  clumsy of you.\nSquidward: I didn't. It was SpongeBob who...\nSandy: Well, there's nothing to do for it, but surgery.\nSpongeBob: Ooh!\nSandy: Now is my chance to try out my new invention-- The solution to your problem.\nSquidward: A submarine?\nSandy: That's right, Squidward. Let me show you.  This whole lab is called the Chamber of Shrinkage.  I'll shrink the sub and myself to microscopic size..  ...then navigate through  your brain,  down into your throat,  then extract the reed  from inside. Simple!\nSquidward: Why don't you just shrink the reed?\nSandy: Oh, Squidward, always wanting to do it the hard way  We're all set, Squidward! Are you ready for the sedative?\nSquidward: Are you sure this is safe?\nSandy: Completely! As long as someone competent is behind the wheel. Hey, what's that?  Hi-yah! Sweet dreams, partner. Oops! I forgot to pack food for the trip. I've got to get some supplies from my treedome, and I need you to guard the submarine while I'm gone.  Do you think you can handle it, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Can do, Sandy!  Hut-hut-hut, hut-hut-hut! Hut- hut-hut, huttidy-hut-hut!\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Hell,o citizen.\nPatrick: What are you doing?\nSpongeBob: Guarding Sandy's submarine.\nPatrick: Wow! I've never been in a submarine. Let's look inside.\nSpongeBob: Can't. I'm guarding it.\nPatrick: Oh, man! Could you guard it from the inside?\nSpongeBob: You're right!  Patrick, you're a genius!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Ooh!\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob and Patrick reporting for guard duty.\nPatrick: Hmm.  \"Shrink.\" I do have a lot of issues.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Pretty.\nSandy: I'm back, SpongeBob.  Uh-oh.\nPatrick: You're so tiny.  A giant SpongeBob!\nSandy: Patrick! SpongeBob!\nPatrick: Sandy's grown to gigantic size!\nSpongeBob: I don't think Sandy grew, Patrick. I think we shrunk.\nPatrick: That's silly. Don't you think it's more likely that the entire world grew?\nSandy: Hi, Squidward.  Well, the submarine is safely inside you.\nSquidward: Wonderful. Wait! If you're out here, then who's in here?\nSandy: Well, why don't you take a look for yourself?\nSquidward: SpongeBob and Patrick are piloting a miniature submarine inside my head. SpongeBob and Patrick... SpongeBob and...\nSandy: You better calm down, Squidward. With them little critters inside you, I wouldn't be moving around too much. You could knock them into something important.\nSpongeBob: Where are we, Patrick?\nPatrick: I don't know, but it's a real dump.\nSandy: SpongeBob, Patrick, can you hear me?\nSpongeBob: It's Sandy.\nPatrick: She's in there?  I'll save you, Sandy!\nSandy: Stop it, you itty-bitty idiot!\nSpongeBob: Sandy, where are you? Where are we?\nSandy: You're trespassing, SpongeBob -- in my lab, in my submarine -- and you're trespassing  inside of Squidward.\nPatrick: I thought this place was in bad shape.\nSquidward: I heard that!\nSandy: Let's get you out of there, SpongeBob. All you need to do is locate the autopilot. It'll safely take you through your mission and then out the extraction point.\nSpongeBob: Um...we broke it.\nSandy: Stop it! What are you trying to do? Kill him?\nSandy: This is approximately 17 times harder to drive than a boat mobile, which you've never successfully done.  So, just take it nice and easy.\nSpongeBob: No problemo. Nice and...easy!\nSquidward: So, how's it going?  I can't control my eyeballs!\nSandy: Don't worry, it's temporary. Now, just sign this!\nSquidward: Okay, now what is this?\nSandy: Oh, just your autograph for when you're, uh... famous.\nSquidward: Oh, of course. I've got  head shots, you know.  What the...\nSandy: Squidward!\nSquidward: What's happening?\nSpongeBob: Give me that!\nPatrick: No, give it back!\nSandy: They're hitting your central nervous system!\nSquidward: Oh. Ya think?\nSandy: You're not in control of your actions!  Hey!\nSquidward: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not in control of my actions.\nSandy: They've gone off course!  Oh my gosh! You're out of control!\nSpongeBob: Ew! Where are we?   Mayday! Mayday! We're sinking! And Patrick won't stop screaming!\nSandy: The stomach acid levels are way too high!\nSpongeBob: The reserve tanks are almost empty.  Patrick!\nPatrick: Finished.\nSandy: SpongeBob, you gotta get out of there! It's a straight shot up the stomach to the esophagus where the reed is!  You can complete your mission if we can just access an alternative fuel.  Like natural gas.\nSpongeBob: Natural gas?\nPatrick: Like this!\nSquidward: Stop burping inside me! That's disgusting!\nSandy: Wait a minute, Squidward. He might be on to something.\nSquidward: What?\nSandy: If you can make a big enough burp...\nPatrick: We can filter the CO2 through our ballast tanks, refire the engines, and ride the shock wave out of here!\nSpongeBob: Wow.\nSandy: He's right.\nSquidward: What?\nSandy: We're going through with your plan, Patrick!\nSpongeBob: Yay!\nPatrick: What plan?\nSandy: Now burp, Squidward! Lives are on the line!\nSpongeBob: I never thought it would end this way.  It's working!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Whee!\nSandy: They're headed for the esophagus.  Phew, what have you been eating?\nSquidward: Morons.\nSpongeBob: SpongeBob to Sandy. We've reached the foreign obstruction.\nSandy: Okay, you're going to have to go out and dislodge it somehow.\nSpongeBob: I'm already on it.\nFrench Narrator: Two hours later.\nSpongeBob: This stupid hammer won't break anything.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, do what you were born to do! Dance!\nSpongeBob: You're right Patrick. Whirlpool Spin!\nSandy: Good work, guys. Mission accomplished.  Now all you have to do is...\nSquidward: Get out of my body! Go!\nPatrick: Grow?\nSandy, Squidward, and SpongeBob: No!\nMr. Krabs: Almost ready to open.  There.\nSquidward: Good morning, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Hello, Squidward. Neptune's trousers! What's gotten into you?\nSpongeBob: Reporting for Duty, Mr. Krabs.\nPatrick: Squidward, the toilet's backed up again.\n","75b\nThat's No Lady\nFish: Hey!  Hey, you there!\nPatrick: Uh, me?\nFish: Yes, you.  Get outta town!  Get outta town! And take a vacation to beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort.  Here ya go, sir.\nPatrick: I gotta get out of town!  Oh, thanks, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Sure, Patrick, ya...\nPatrick: I gotta get going! He told me to!\nSpongeBob: Who did?\nPatrick: Uhh, well, uhh... hmmm, I'm not sure. But he had a briefcase.\nSpongeBob: Ahh, a briefcase?! He might be a paid assassin!  But, Patrick, you can't go. Not like this. Who will go with me to the next jellyfisherman's expo?\nPatrick: It'll have to be one of your other chums 'cause my mind is set.\nSpongeBob: Unset it, please unset it!\nPatrick: I guess I'll pack up my stuff and get ready to go.  My clothes.\nSpongeBob: Umm, Patrick, those are my clothes.\nPatrick: My peanut butter!\nSpongeBob: That's my peanut butter.\nPatrick: And my pickles!\nSpongeBob: I can't believe you're leaving, Patrick.  With all my pickles!\nPatrick: It's the end of me being here.\nSpongeBob: Wait! Stop! What about all our plans?  8:00am - Wake up Patrick, 9:00am - Eat Kelpo with Patrick, 10:00am - Brush teeth with Patrick, 1:00pm - Stare at Patrick. Who's gonna do all that with me?\nPatrick: I'm sorry, there's no stopping the unstoppable. Patrick Star will live no more, forever... in Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: But... what if you weren't Patrick Star?\nPatrick: Oh, no. I'm not Patrick Star?\nSpongeBob: You are Patrick Star, but you won't be for long.\nPatrick: Huh?  There ya go, Patrick. No one will know it's you.  Patrick, you okay?\nLarry: Hey guys! Yo, Patrick, cool shades.\nSpongeBob: Well, Pat, that disguise didn't work. We're gonna have to try harder.\nPatrick: Yeah, well, thanks ol' SpongeBob for your help. It was a noble effort but alas, all in vain, it's no use. I must leave.  Goodbye rock. Goodbye coral.  YOW!  Goodbye seaweed.\nSpongeBob: Too bad we couldn't come up with a better costume.  Hmmm...\nPatrick: Goodbye sky.\nSpongeBob: That's it. With the seaweed on your head, you could be a...\nPatrick: Oh, I know, I know! I could be Mr. Seaweed Monsterman. And live happily forever after in Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, there already is a Mr. Seaweed Monsterman.\nSeaweed Monsterman: Hey!\nPatrick: D'oh!\nSpongeBob: It's okay, Patrick. So you can't be a monster. But that vegetation on your head gives me an idea of what you can be.  You're all set. Come on out, Patrick.\nFish #2: Hi, SpongeBob. And hello, lady.\nSpongeBob: The disguise is working, Patrick... I mean, Patricia.\nLarry: SpongeBob, you never told me you had a girlfriend.\nPatrick: Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. I'm Pat...\nSpongeBob: ...tricia. Pat-ricia. Patricia!\nLarry: Bro, your girlfriend is not ugly.\nSpongeBob: Actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend, she's just a...\nLarry: It's cool, buddy. You don't have to explain your girlfriend to me.\nSpongeBob: But she's not my girlfriend.\nLarry: I don't know why you're standing here talking to me when you could be talking to your girlfriend.\nSpongeBob: C'mon, Patricia.\nPatricia: Bye.\nLarry: Congratulations on the new girlfriend, dude!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! This is not the time for Sunday Stroll. It's time for work.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab doesn't open for another two hours.\nMr. Krabs: There be no such thing as opening too early, me boy. Excuse us, miss. Huh?  SpongeBob, who's your friend?\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, this is Patricia.\nMr. Krabs: Patricia. The most beautiful sound I've ever seen. SpongeBob, do we need any more help down at the Krusty Krab?\nSpongeBob: No.\nMr. Krabs: We do? Great, she can start right away.\nSquidward: He-  And who are you, my rubenesque beauty?\nMr. Krabs: That's Patricia, our newest Krusty Krab employee.\nSquidward: Well, she sure is stunning.\nMr. Krabs: Just keep your eyes on the customers, Mr. Squidward.\nSquidward: Hi, Patricia. I drew this for you.  Likeness is uncanny, if I do say so myself.\nPatricia: Uhh, thank you, Squidward.\nMr. Krabs: Order up, Miss Patricia.\nPatricia: Excuse me, Squidward.\nMr. Krabs: This order goes to table 7 and remember your manners.\nPatricia: Forty... thirty...\nMr. Krabs: That's a 7, Patricia.\nPatricia: Mr. Krabs, you ordered two Krusty meals?\nMr. Krabs: Did I order two meals? Oh, silly me. I can't possibly eat two Krusty meals, myself.  I guess you'll just have to help me finish all this food.\nPatricia: Okay.\nMr. Krabs: Patricia, we may have only known each other for a short time, now, but I feel like a special connection has been made.\nSpongeBob: Quite an appetite, but she's all woman.\nSquidward: Eh? Ya know, Patricia, they don't call me the 'Sizzle Lips Squid' for nothing.  So, are you free this Saturday night?\nPatricia: No, that's the night SpongeBob and I are having a staring contest.\nSquidward: SpongeBob?!\nMr. Krabs: Get back to work, you gold-bricking freeloader. Hut two, hut two, yah, yah! And don't come back 'til all the patties are krabby.  Well, now that we're alone, how would you like to be my date Friday night to a...\nPatricia: Well, I can't. SpongeBob and I will be flying submarines that night. I have to get back to Krusting the Krab.  Man, why are those two so nice to me? They were never this nice to Patrick. It's weird.\nSquidward: Are you sure about Saturday night?\nPatricia: Persistent bunch.\nMr. Krabs: How about Sunday brunch?\nPatricia: No thanks, again!\nSquidward: But I made reservations for two at...\nPatricia: I said no.  No.  No way.  No.  No.  NO!  What is it about me that makes those two so friendly? It must have something to do with this disguise. I can't wear this any longer.\nSpongeBob: But if you reveal your secret identity, you'll have to leave Bikini Bottom!\nPatricia: Well, I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I just can't live like this anymore. I'm tired of pretending to be someone I'm not.\nFancy Fish: The lovely Patricia  has returned to us!\nPatricia: I have an announcement to make. The entire day that I've worked here I've wanted to say...  Um-um-um-uh...  I've wanted to say that, uhh, th-that...  That I will eat any leftovers on your plate!\nCustomers: Huh?\nSunny Seashores Salesfish: Ahoy, waitress, aren't you gonna take my order?\nPatricia: I'll be right there, sir.\nSpongeBob: What's the matter, Patrick?\nPatricia: That's the guy with the briefcase. The guy who's trying to run me out of town.\nSpongeBob: The assassin.\nPatricia: What can I get you, sir?\nSunny Seashores Salesfish: Say, don't I know you from somewhere?\nPatricia: No!\nSunny Seashores Salesfish: Hmmm... that's it. Get outta town!\nPatricia: He's onto us.\nSpongeBob: I won't let you do it. You'll have to do something horrible to me before I let you throw Patrick out of town.\nSquidward & Mr. Krabs: Patrick?!\nSunny Seashores Salesfish: You forgot your flyer.\nSpongeBob: Get outta town! To beautiful Sunny Seashores Resort. Look, this guy wasn't trying to run you out of town, he just wanted to sell you a luxury vacation at a modest price.\nPatricia: Well, I guess I don't need this disguise anymore.\nSquidward: Umm, I think I need to take a shower.\nMr. Krabs: So, let me get this straight, uh, you're not a woman?\nPatrick: No.\nMr. Krabs: Well then, you're fired. Uhh, if anybody needs me, I'll be in my office for, I dunno, the next 20 years or so.\nSpongeBob: Hey, buddy, what do you say we go home and get started on this list?\nPatrick and SpongeBob: Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooo!\n","76a\nThe Thing\nSquidward: It's too quiet. Something isn't right around here.  Could it be? SpongeBob is gone for the evening.  Here's to a delightful evening alone with you, public television.\nPatrick: Do it again. Do it again.\nSpongeBob: Okay.\nSquidward: Will you two be quiet?! I'm trying to watch public television.\nPatrick: Do it again, do it again.\nSquidward: If those two want to ruin my quiet evening at home, they're going to have to do better than that.  What?\nSpongeBob: Squidward!\nSquidward: You're still there, aren't you?\nSpongeBob: Good evening, Squidward.\nSquidward: Not so fast. You two little monsters aren't about to ruin my evening.\nSpongeBob: Oh, we're not here to ruin it. We're here to enhance it. Isn't that right, Pat?\nPatrick: Yeah. We're here...\nSquidward: Can't a hard working Squid get a little TV time alone?  SpongeBob? Patrick? Oh, what's the point?\nPatrick: Could you turn it up?\nSpongeBob: Uh, Squidward, could you turn it down a little?\nPatrick: Squidward, what's this about?\nSpongeBob: Squidward, how come he's so emotional?\nPatrick: Is he the bad guy?\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\nPatrick: Squidward?\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\nPatrick: Squidward?\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\nPatrick: Squidward?\nSquidward: That's it! All I wanted to do was watch some smooth jazz on public television. But apparently, that's not going to happen. Once again, I'm going to have to leave my own home just to get some peace and quiet. Enjoy my TV.\nPatrick: Oh wait, I think I've seen this before. This part's funny.\nSquidward: I'm going to go somewhere far away. Somewhere far away from those two watching public television on my TV. Pfah! They wouldn't know real culture even if it hit them like a truck full of cement.  Oh.  Day five, I think. I've been waddling these fields. I'm hungry, tired, and lost. The only good thing about this is no SpongeBob.  Jellyfish Fields.\nSpongeBob: What is that thing, Patrick?\nPatrick: I dunno. Let's get a closer look.\nSpongeBob: Hi, stranger. I am SpongeBob.  Wait a minute. Maybe he's not a monster. Maybe he's an endangered species. We should help him.\nPatrick: Yeah, help him. Go away. Can't you tell nobody wants you? You're endangered.\nSpongeBob: Not like that. With lots of love and affection. We can take care of him.  Well, Smelly, here you are. Your new home. Oh, Smelly, this is going to be great. We'll be one big happy family. Let me show you around. Here's your bed, Smelly.  Here's your food bowl.\nPatrick: And some kibble.\nSpongeBob: You can live here forever and ever.  Oh, look, Pat. He's crying tears of joy. Well, Smelly, there's one more family member you haven't met.  Smelly, meet Gary.  Aww, look at that, Smelly, Gary likes you.  Gary, no!  Gary!\nPatrick: I don't think Gary likes Smelly.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, Gary's never attacked anyone like that except Squidward. I guess Smelly can't live here.\nPatrick: Ah! He can come live with me.\nSpongeBob: That's a great idea, Patrick. You\u2019ve always wanted a pet.  Isn't that cute? Look how excited he is to get to your house.  Bye, Smelly. Have fun at Patrick's.\nPatrick: No, no, Smelly. Squidward doesn't like pets.  Hey, Smelly, wanna play catch?  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Almost.  Again.  So close.  Yeah, now you're...  Smelly! What's gotten into you?!  Hello, Animal Control? There's a wild animal loose in my house.  Sure, I'll hold.  Smelly! Come back! Smelly!\nPolice: Freeze!\nSpongeBob: Hmmm, what's all the commotion?\nPolice: You're surrounded. There is no way out.\nSpongeBob: Smelly.  Excuse me. Pardon me. If I can just scootch through there. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. You leave Smelly alone. He's just a poor, dumb wild animal.\nPolice: Wild animals don't belong here, son. They belong in the zoo. Get 'em, boys.\nSpongeBob: Smelly.\nIsabelle: Mommy, what is that thing?\nSadie: I don't know but it's hideous, isn't it?\nSpongeBob: This isn't good.\nPatrick: You're absolutely right.  It needs mustard.\nSpongeBob: No one should be treated like that. Not even someone as ugly as Smelly. Something needs to be done about this. And I know exactly what that thing is.  Okay, Patrick, remember the plan?\nPatrick: Oh, yeah.  This one, right?\nSpongeBob: No, not that. I'm talking about the plan to break Smelly out of this animal prison.\nPatrick: Mmm, good plan.\nSpongeBob: All right, I'll go down first. Keep a lookout and follow me.\nPatrick: You're my hero.  SpongeBob! Help! Ah!\nSpongeBob: Shh, we'll get caught.\nPatrick: What?! I can't hear you! I'm screaming too loud!\nSpongeBob: Fear no longer, dear Smelly, we are here to rescue you. Understand? We are taking you home.  Look how excited he is. Flip the switch, Patrick.  Smelly, you're free!\nPolice: You're surrounded. There's no use trying to run.\nSpongeBob: Run, Patrick, run!  Faster, Patrick.\nPatrick: I'll let Smelly go first.\nSpongeBob: Don't worry, Smelly, you're safe with us.\nPatrick: I think we lost them.\nSpongeBob: Well, we're all one big happy family again. Let's see where this dark sewer tunnel leads.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la.\nSpongeBob: Oh, it's all right, Smelly. Soon, we'll be home and you can sleep in that cozy little pet carrier you love so much.\nPatrick: Hey, I see light.\nSpongeBob: You're right, Patrick. That must be the way out. Whoa... where are we?  Let's go ask those guys. Um, excuse us.  Hey, they look just like you. Go, be with your real family. Go ahead, Smelly. I know you've come to think of us as a family, but it's better this way.\nPatrick: I'm going to miss him, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Me too, buddy. Me too, but he's with his kind now, where he belongs, and on that note, let us go back to where we belong.\nKelpy G: Ah... salutation, my children. Are you ready for your daily dose of smooth jazz?\nSquidward: Um... hi.\n","76b\nHocus Pocus\nSpongeBob: Come on, stovie, pop that corn!  Get ready, Gary.  Incoming!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Popcorn is served!\nMedley: That, bro, is trouble at any car wash.\nTV Announcer: We will return to \"Bikini Bottom Car Wash\" after these messages.\nCommercial Announcer: Are you boring?\nCharlie: Yes, yes I am.\nCommercial Announcer: When friends describe you, do they use words like...  \"dull!\" or \"drab!?\"\nCharlie: Don't forget \"platitudinous\".\nCommercial Announcer: Yes, that too, Charlie. But what if I told you that you can change all that with the magic of... magic!\nCharlie: I look like some kind of magician. Now people won't ignore me.\nCommercial Announcer: Let's hope not, Charlie. With my \"Mister Magic Magical Magic Kit\", even you can impress and amaze your friends.\nSpongeBob: I want to impress and amaze my friends!\nCommercial Announcer: Just send $19.95 to me, Mister Magic.\nNarrator: 4 to 6 weeks later...\nMailman: One magic kit and another one of these yellow things.\nSpongeBob: Here it is: Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit.  Look at all this! A book of spells, my very own wand of whimsy, the beard of Rasputin, and, of course, the all-important license to practice magic.  Squidward! He'll appreciate my newly delivered skill.\nSquidward: Brine soda, low-fast seaweed crisps, cool jazz.  Mm, mm, Squidward you have done it. You have officially spoiled yourself rotten.\nSpongeBob: Well, let the rotting continue, friend, while I impress and amaze you with...magic!\nSquidward: Magic? Can you make yourself disappear, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Silly Squidward. I won't learn vanishing spells until I become a level 10 wizard.  No, I better start with something simpler.  Say card conjuring.  Here, hold this simple, playing card while I transform it into a magic playing card before your very eyes. Let's see...  step 1...\nSquidward: This can't possibly end soon.\nSpongeBob: Which brings us to... step three. Juggle something. Well, if you insist, Mister Magic.\nSquidward: I don't care where I'm going, just take me away from here.\nSpongeBob: Then take one card and shove it in your ear.\nMonroe: But I don't like pistachio!\nTom: Then why did you ask for it?\nSpongeBob: And finally, say the words \"Hobris-Pobris\".  Squidward! My simple card-trick has turned you into an ice cream cone. Which means... I am a level ten wizard! I suppose I should change you back to squid form.  Presto!  Uh, let's see. Umm... A-ha! Alakazam!  Abracadabra.  Okilee-dokilee. Hobra-cobra. Oh! Open sesame. Change-o back-o to Squidward-o, please-o? Oh, I am so sorry, Squidward.  I've transformed you into a delicious dairy dessert and I can't change you back! There, there, Squidward. There is no need to cry. I promise you will continue your normal life despite the fact that you are now edible.  Whoa-oh!  Squidward! Speak to me! Speak!  Hey, Squid, are you okay?  Hey, Squid, are you still okay?  Hey, Squidward, I got something for ya! Someone to keep you company in that drab ol' freezer.  Oh, aren't they cute? I promise to stand by as an eternal guard over my buddy.\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?\nSpongeBob: I have turned poor Squidward into a frozen dessert.\nPatrick: That's awful. How tragic. Poor Squidward.\nSpongeBob: It's all my fault.\nPatrick: Did you say frozen dessert?\nSpongeBob: Yeah. I turned him into a tasty soft-serve with a waffle cone.\nPatrick: Oh...soft serve.\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Stop eating Squidward!\nPatrick: Oh, sorry.\nSpongeBob: Patrick!  Pat...!\nPatrick: But he's so tasty!\nSpongeBob: Look, Patrick! Don't you understand!?  This isn't just your ordinary ice cream cone.\nPatrick: It's pistachio.\nSpongeBob: No! It's Squidward!  And no matter what happens, I promised him that I would watch over him to ensure his soft, frozen life is unchanged.  Patrick! Squidward has melted! Quick, call the police. What am I going to do?! Oh, Neptune, it's all my fault! What have I done?! What have I done?!  It's all your fault!  Curse you, Mister Magic's Magical Magic Kit! Curse you! Hey, that's it! That's the answer to our problems!\nPatrick: Warning: From ages 9 to 99.\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, the one mystic being that can help us: Mister Magic!  Just follow the brown-tiled road to the most mysterious mystic of them all! No one's ever seen him in person.\nDeep Male Voice: Enter!  Who dares to see Mister Magic?!  Speak up!\nSpongeBob: It is I, SpongeBob of the SquarePants, Magician Level 1. And I have turned my friend into ice cream.\nMister Magic: Good job.\nSpongeBob: Well, thank you, but well, I can't change him back.\nMister Magic: Hmmm, um, well, have you ever thought of a different hobby?\nSpongeBob: I need your help to change him back.\nMister Magic: My help?  Uh, no thank you.\nSpongeBob: But if you don't, my friend will be a cone forever.\nMister Magic: Sorry, I... umm... I'm out to lunch, that's it.\nSpongeBob: I'll wait.\nMister Magic: I'm on a two-year lunch.\nSpongeBob: Oh, please.\nMister Magic: Silence!\nSpongeBob: But, sir, no one else has your power of sorcery.\nMister Magic: Thank...you.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, there's a guy over here talking into a tubey thing.\nHorace: Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.\nMister Magic: Uhh, ignore your friend. The fish you see is only an illusion.\nPatrick: Why's he saying the same thing Mister Magic's saying?\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. Who are you, good sir?\nHorace: Well, I... uh... I'm Horace B. Magic.\nSpongeBob: Are you Mister Magic?\nHorace: Technically, yes. But the only magic around here is the magic of business.\nSpongeBob: Does that mean you can't change my friend back?\nHorace: I'm, I'm afraid not. So sorry about that, laddie. Your refund check is in the mail.\nSpongeBob: I don't need a refund, I want my friend back! This isn't about money. You're nothing but a fake--just a lying, corporate businessman, tainting the purity of magic with your corrupt commercial ways!  You have ruined my faith in the magical arts.\nHorace: Security.\nSpongeBob: What are we going to do about Squidward?\nPatrick: We could always eat him. I'm kind of hungry.\nSpongeBob: Mister Magic was a fake and all his magic stuff is fake! All those magic words, they were fake. Yacky, shmacky, bappy, dappy, doppy, blabby, flabby, murkery, fool, magic of bloob-jiggacacies!...\nSquidward: Ew.  What are you doing, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Squidward! You're back. The magic words worked.  I really am magical after all. Can I turn you into something else, now?\nSquidward: Hey, stop!  Get me out of here!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob? I'm still hungry. Can you turn me into a jar of mayonnaise so I can eat myself?\nSpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Patrick-a mayonnaise-ica.\n","77a\nDriven to Tears\nNarrator: It is a very special day in Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!  I'm ready! I'm ready! Patrick, did you bring my flashcards?\nPatrick: Right here, buddy.  Everything you need to pass the test is on these cards.  Mmm.\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick!\nPatrick: Hey, learning tastes good.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I needed those.\nPatrick: Oh, fiddlesticks. You've taken that driving test more times than anyone.\nSpongeBob: 57 times.\nPatrick: Well, then 58 is your lucky number. You're gonna pass that driving test, SpongeBob, because you're a winner.\nSpongeBob: I'm a winner?\nPatrick: Who's a winner?\nSpongeBob: I'm a winner.\nPatrick: Who's a winner?\nSpongeBob: I'm a winner.\nPatrick: Who's a winner?!\nSpongeBob: I'm a winner! I'm a winner! I'm a winner!\nNarrator: One minute thirty seven seconds later...\nPatrick: How'd you do, winner?  Let's see that license.\nSpongeBob: I didn't get a license, Patrick.\nPatrick: Are they gonna mail it to you?\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick, I failed the boating test. I guess 58 wasn't my lucky number after all.\nPatrick: No way! 58 is, like, the luckiest number ever! The test must be rigged.\nSpongeBob: Let's just go home, Patrick.\nPatrick: We're not going anywhere until I get to the bottom of this. I'm taking that test, myself.\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick! I've been training for years. They'll eat you alive.\nPatrick: Please, SpongeBob. I think I know what I'm doing.\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. No!\nMrs. Puff: Good morning.\nPatrick: You're not the judge of me!\nMrs. Puff: Actually, I am. Let the testing begin!\nSpongeBob: I shouldn't have let him do it.

You're the one millionth person to pass the test.\nPatrick: Does that mean I get a free key chain?\nFish: Uhh, no.\nPatrick: Oh.\nFish: You get a brand-new boat mobile. The new Bass Blaster 3000. The ultimate boating machine.\nPatrick: Yeah! All right!\nFish: Women will want you.  Men will want to be you.  You'll be the envy of your friends.\nPatrick: Isn't this great? I got my license and a new boat.\nSpongeBob: I'm so happy for you...  Whoa!\nPatrick: The horn works.  Woo! This is the greatest day ever. Right, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Right, Patrick. I can't think of one thing that would make this day better. Except maybe getting my license.\nPatrick: Maybe if you apply yourself you could be the two millionth person to get his license.\nSpongeBob: Two millionth?\nPatrick: Then you can get a free boat just like me.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, just like you.\nPatrick: I try to serve as an inspiration to others.\nSpongeBob: Can we go home now?  We've been driving around your house for hours.\nPatrick: I know. It's a lot faster than walking, isn't it?\nSpongeBob: Thanks for the ride, Patrick.\nPatrick: No problem, buddy. You can't help being a... pedestrian.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\nPatrick: I'm trying to work on my boat mobile. Now could you keep it down? It's 3:00 in the morning, people are trying to sleep.\nSpongeBob: 4:00?  Who could be at the door at this hou\u2014  Now what is it, Patrick?\nPatrick: You will never guess what happen to me today.\nSpongeBob: You got your license.\nPatrick: Yeah!  But that's not all.\nSpongeBob: You got a new boat.\nPatrick: Yeah. Have you been following me? You know, you need to get your own life.\nSpongeBob: Oh... I just need a few minutes sleep.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Yes, Gary, I saw his new boat.  I'm so tired.\nPatrick: Hey, buddy. Need a ride to work?\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Patrick, but I'd rather walk to work.\nPatrick: Boy, I never realized how empty life is without a license.\nSpongeBob: Thanks for the ride.\nPatrick: No problem, buddy. You can give me rides once you get your license. I mean, if you get your license.\nSpongeBob: That's it. I am through driving around with Patrick. If I have to see one more boat mobile...\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're manning the drive-thru.\nSpongeBob: When did we get a drive-thru?\nMr. Krabs: I realized there's a lot of young people on the go these days. They don't have time to sit down and eat. They're too busy out on the open road living their dreams.\nSpongeBob: I used to have a dream.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah? I used to have a kidney stone. Everything passes eventually. Now stop dreaming and work for a living.\nSpongeBob: Welcome to the Krusty Krab, may I\u2014\nPatrick: The horn still works.  Hey, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: What's with the helmet, Patrick?\nPatrick: Well, since I'm now an expert driver, I have to keep up my image.\nSpongeBob: Uh-huh.\nPatrick: Boy, driving is so easy.\nSpongeBob: Oh?\nPatrick: Do you want me to give you lessons?\nSpongeBob: Oh, that would be great.\nPatrick: Oh!\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\nPatrick: Hi, mommy. Hi, daddy.\nMr. SquarePants: Patrick, how many times do we have to tell you we're SpongeBob's mom and dad, not yours?\nPatrick: What? I'm an orphan? Oh, but guess what? I passed my driver's test.\nMrs. SquarePants: That's great, Patrick.\nPatrick: SpongeBob failed his test, so don't mention it.\nMrs. SquarePants: Oh, we know how to stay clear of that minefield.\nSpongeBob: Mom!\nPatrick: Well, I've got to take Mr. Walks-a-lot back home. He's always asking for rides.\nSpongeBob: Hey.\nMr. SquarePants: Even Patrick has a license.\nPatrick: Let's see what this baby can do.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, the speed limit is 40mph.\nPatrick: Yeah, yeah.\nSpongeBob: 40.5mph? That's almost 41mph. He's speeding. Patrick! Stop this car.\nPatrick: What? Where? Who?\nSpongeBob: Officer, it is my civilian duty to report that the the driver of this vehicle is speeding. Why don't you clock him with your radar gun?\nOfficer: Umm... okay.  Actually, he's going 40mph under the limit. So, move along before I run you in, tattletale.\nSpongeBob: Are you sure you don't want to run him in?  It's a red light, Patrick!  Patrick, you just ran three red lights!\nPatrick: So?\nSpongeBob: You're suppose to stop!\nPatrick: I think the driving genius knows what he's doing.\nSpongeBob: Driving genius?! Why would a genius make an illegal u-turn... through an orphanage?!\nPatrick: They ran for it in time. What are you so mad about?\nSpongeBob: I should've gotten that license, and this should be my boat mobile!\nPatrick: How can you say that?! If you were my friend, you'd be happy for me getting my license!\nSpongeBob: If you were my friend, you wouldn't rub your license in my face!\nPatrick: I'm not rubbing my license in your face! This is rubbing my license in your face!\nSpongeBob: Oh, give me that! I worked my whole life for this! You don't deserve this!\nOfficer: Huh, litterbugs. This is why I joined the force.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: It's the police!\nOfficer: Pull it over, litterbug!\nPatrick: Litterbug?! No!\nOfficer: Ooh, I got me a runner.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what do you think you're doing?\nPatrick: I don't know! I don't have a license anymore.\nJudge: 90 days. I hope you learned a valuable lesson about littering.\nPatrick: So long, buddy. Don't forget to feed Gary. Sometimes you forget to feed him.\nSpongeBob: What have I done? Patrick can't survive in prison. He's too soft. Wait!  Patrick's innocent. I tore up Patrick's license and threw it out the window. I'm the litterbug. Take me instead.\nJudge: Well, considering there's no legal precedent... oh, what the heck. 90 days!\nNarrator: One debt to society later...\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\nPatrick: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: I'm glad you passed the test. I'm glad you have a license. And to prove it, I made you this: Pals 4 Ever.  Let's put it on your boat mobile, buddy.\nPatrick: Oh, I don't have a boat mobile anymore.\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: It stopped working so I threw it away. The needle was on E and I figured that must mean end.\nSpongeBob: Oh, then what do we do with this?\nPatrick: How's that?\nSpongeBob: Yeah!\nPatrick: Ready, buddy?\nSpongeBob: Ready, pal.  Woo! Woo!\n","77b\nRule of Dumb\nPatrick: Yeah?\nStarfish: Good day, sir.

There's someone else.\nMan on TV: Grandpa!\nPatrick: SpongeBob, help! He's onto me! I don't have much time!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\nPatrick: I have to get rid of these books!\nSpongeBob: Why?\nPatrick: I'll show you why.  See him? He's from the library. He knows about my overdue books.  Uh-huh. Which means I'm gonna get thrown into the big house. And you know what that means...\nSpongeBob: Small portion meals?\nPatrick: Exactly!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, don't you worry. I got your back, man.  Hi there.\nStarfish: Salutations, young one. Say, you wouldn't happen to know that starfish that lives under this rock, would you?\nSpongeBob: Huh? No, I don't know any starfish. Even if I did know this \"alleged\" starfish, Patrick wouldn't owe any overdue library books.\nStarfish: Well, it's too bad you don't know Patrick Star, because I am from the Royal Ministry, and have a gift for him.\nPatrick: Ooh, what is it?  This is the worst-tasting gift ever!\nStarfish: That's because you're suppose to wear it, not eat it. Allow me to show you something.  Let's see here. Aha! What I hold in my hands is a family tree that goes back centuries. It starts with the marriage of King Amoeba and Queen Mildew. Then, through a few inbred generations, ends at you, Sir Patrick, which makes you a descendant of royalty. You are a king. And now it's time I adjourn to the Royal Ministry, where I should be at your service. Your Highness.\nSpongeBob: Wow, Patrick, that's great!\nPatrick: What is?\nSpongeBob: That you're king!\nPatrick: What's a king?\nSpongeBob: When you're a king, you can get anything you want.\nPatrick: Anything I want?  SpongeBob, do you think we can get something to eat?\nSpongeBob: Your wish is my command, your majesty.  Good townspeople, let us rejoice in welcoming our new king.\nPatrick: King needs food badly.\nMr. Krabs: What's this all ab...  Well, well, well. What can I do for you, Patrick?\nSpongeBob: The king would like...\nMr. Krabs: Zip it, SquarePants... I'm talking to the rich guy.\nPatrick: I'll have ten Krabby Patties, a Krabby milkshake, large fries...\nMr. Krabs: I've got a better idea.  A buffet fit for a king.\nPatrick: Tasty.\nMr. Krabs: Listen, Patrick, there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to settle down. You know, get a wife, kids, a father-in-law you give all your money to.\nPatrick: Uh-huh, that sounds great. Hey, can I get a little more ketchup?\nMr. Krabs: How about you pay the check, instead?\nPatrick: Oh, sorry, Mr Krabs, no can do. As king of Bikini Bottom, I am allowed to have anything I want. Isn't that right, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: That is correct. Anything you want, and it's all free.\nMr. Krabs: All free?!!?  Nobody eats in me restaurant for free, king or no king!\nPatrick: Are you gonna eat that?\nHarold: I was planning to, why?\nPatrick: I want it.\nHarold: Hey! What gives you the right to take my food?\nPatrick: Tell him, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Pat, I'm not sure this is what being king is all about.\nPatrick: I thought you said I could have anything I want. Was my bestest friend lying to me?\nSpongeBob: Don't be ridiculous, Patrick. I'd never lie to you.\nPatrick: Good! Now tell him.\nSpongeBob: Hi. By proclamation of the Royal Ministry, the king is entitled to get whatever he wants.\nHarold: This isn't fair.\nPatrick: Life isn't fair, pal. Get used to it.\nFish: I finally did it! At long last, I've acquired issue #2 of Wonder Space Fish, and in mint condition. Now my 40 year-old life and my comic book collection are complete. Mom's gonna be so proud of me.\nPatrick: No, she won't be, because these comic books are mine!\nFish: But, I've spent my entire life collecting those.\nPatrick: Yeah, well, now you can spend the rest of your life crying about it. I'm the king!\nFish: I will cry about it.  I'll cry right to my mom!\nPatrick: I love being king.\nSpongeBob: Ok, thank you, sir. I'm sure King Patrick could use this walker.\nOld Man Jenkins: I hope so. Neptune knows I did.  Oof!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Yes, sire?\nPatrick: I need your opinion on something. Do you think the giant flat-screen TV should go over the fancy egg display or the indoor swimming pool?\nSquidward: Hello, sunshine.  What a beautiful morning. Just perfect.\nPatrick: Back. Back. Okay. Yeah, that's good.  Perfect.\nSquidward: My-my-my house. What's happened to my...huh?  SpongeBob, Patrick. What the barnacles is going on here?! Look at what you've done. Look at my poor front yard.\nPatrick: Your front yard?\nSpongeBob: Umm, his royal highness is building a royal Ferris Wheel.\nSquidward: Ferris Wheel?\nSpongeBob: I know, isn't it great?\nSquidward: No, it's not great! It's horrible. Oh, that's it. Stop! People of Bikini Bottom, stop! Stop! Patrick's no king. Look at him. How can this pink blob be king?\nPatrick: Uh...\nSquidward: You. Do you honestly believe that that mindless starfish can possibly be the king of anything?  King of Morons, maybe.\nCrowd: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nWorker: He might be on to something.\nSquidward: Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, see? Uh-huh. See?\nMan: Why are we giving this guy all our stuff?\nSquidward: See? See? You're not a king. And now, they all think so,  too!\nPatrick: Get him! Attack! Attack!  SpongeBob, get him! So I decree. Attack!\nSpongeBob: Uh, right away, your majesty. Umm, Squidward?\nSquidward: What?\nSpongeBob: Umm, could I get you to sign this treaty promising your eternal loyalty to King Patrick?\nSquidward: Give me that! A treaty, huh? Well, here's what I think of your treaty!\nPatrick: My royal subjects have deserted me. And it's all 'cause of that horrible Squidward. This is all his fault. His, his, not mine, his!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what's happened to you?\nPatrick: I don't know what you mean.\nSpongeBob: Uh...  You know, Mr Krabs is probably wondering where I am...and...\nPatrick: And what...\nSpongeBob: Um, well...it's just that, um, you're kinda being a jerk.\nPatrick: Huh?  I thought you were going to say I was abusing my power.\nSpongeBob: Uh...well, I...\nPatrick: Who's saying I'm abusing my POWER!?!  I'll put the whole town in prison!  Questioning my authority is treason! All these giggly speeches are making me thirsty. SpongeBob, I request a drink. SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?! Huh. Gee, everybody's gone. I'm all alone. Fine, I'll get it myself!\nMirror: Knock knock.\nPatrick: Huh?  A knock knock joke!  Who's there?\nMirror: You.\nPatrick and Mirror: I don't get it.\nMirror: I'm you and you are me.\nPatrick and Mirror: What have I become?!\nPatrick: Aaah, help! Monster! Monster!  Huh? Oh, it's, it's you!  Here, here, take it. I don't want it anymore. It's turned me into a monster.\nStarfish: Oh, I think I know what's going on here. Patrick, with great power comes great responsibility.  You haven't a clue what I just told you, do you?\nPatrick: No. Uh-uh.\nStarfish: Oh, just as well. I've come to take the crown back, as it seems that you aren't royalty after all.\nPatrick: Huh?\nStarfish: I've discovered this coffee stain, which upon removal, reveals that Sir Gary is the true heir to the king's crown.\nSpongeBob: Well, would you look at that. Gary, you're royalty!\nGary: Meow?\n","78a\nBorn to Be Wild\nSpongeBob: La la la la la.  Missed ya. Uh-oh.  You shouldn't play in the street, little guy. You could get run over.  The \"Ild Ones\"!

Don't you know who the Wild Ones are, son?!\nSpongeBob: No; I don't know who you are, either.\nFish: Why, they're the most ferocious, bloodthirsty biker gang under the sea. They've destroyed entire cities in an afternoon!\nSpongeBob: Bloodthirsty bikers? And they're headed straight for Bikini Bottom! I've got to warn everybody! I better take the shortcut!  Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Where in the blue barnacles did you come from?\nSpongeBob: There's no time for that, Mr. Krabs. Grab something heavy! Bar the door! Board up the windows.

What are you all riled up about?\nSpongeBob: Bikers... coming... nasty... ferocious... take... over... town. Destroy... must hide!\nMr. Krabs: What are you going on about?

Welcome Wild Ones! They'll be drawn here like a sailor at a tattoo parlor. With the special biker parking and authentic biker decor, with real bloodstains. And to top it off, a custom chopper patty. And best of all, I'll raise me prices 150%.

I don't want to talk about it, man.\nPatrick: Hide me!\nSpongeBob: No, hide me!\nPatrick: Hide me!\nSpongeBob: Me!\nPatrick: No, me!\nSpongeBob: Me!\nPatrick: Me!\nSpongeBob: Me!\nPatrick: No! No more running.\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: Those bikers think they're so tough. With their leather hats  and their leather pants.\nSpongeBob: Their leather socks.\nPatrick: If we dressed up like that, then we'd be the big, scary bikers and they'd be little baby doody-heads.\nSpongeBob: Say that again, Patrick.\nPatrick: Little baby doody-heads?\nSpongeBob: No, no, not that part. The part about dressing up like big, scary bikers.  What do you think, Patrick? Do I look tough?\nPatrick: I wouldn't mess with ya.\nSpongeBob: Nor I with you, my friend. Let's ride.  Fear not. There is no need to panic. The Bikini Bottom bad boys are here.\nHarold: Ooh, I feel protected now.\nScooter: Those are some mean looking rides, dudes.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, it's working. They think we're... vicious bikers.  Bikini Bottom, your salvation is here.\nPatrick: See?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, that's your salivation.\nPatrick: Oh.\nSpongeBob: So, Squidward, are you ready to do your part?\nSquidward: Does that part include laughing at you? \u2018Cause you two look even more idiotic than usual.\nSpongeBob: Don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty?\nPatrick: I'm bloodthirsty. See?  Want some?\nSpongeBob: Oh, no thank you, Patrick. I'm drinking diet blood.  See, Squidward? We walk the walk, but can we talk the talk? Do you want to join our biker gang?\nSquidward: No, I don't.\nPatrick: What about our biker club?\nSquidward: No.\nSpongeBob: How about our biker organization?\nSquidward: No! I don't want to join your biker alliance, your outfits, or your fellowships.\nSpongeBob: What about our coalition?\nPatrick: Ooh, I don't know. That one's pretty exclusive.\nSpongeBob: We'll just pencil you down as undecided.  Hi, Mr. Krabs. We're the Bikini Bottom bad boys and we're bad to the bone.\nMr. Krabs: This'll be great. Those bikers can work up an appetite beating you up in the parking lot. Then they can fill up on delicious Krabby Patties then they can beat you up again.\nSpongeBob: Please, Mr. Krabs. We're going to run off those bikers and save the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs: You're not running off any of me paying customers. You can stay and get beat up in the parking lot if you wish.\nSpongeBob: Then can we save the town?\nSquidward: Has it ever crossed your mind that you might be getting all worked up over nothing?\nSpongeBob: Squidward, when have I ever been known to over-react?  Squidward! We're out of napkins!  Out of napkins!  Squidward! I accidentally removed the \"Do Not Remove by Penalty of Law\" tag on my mattress! Hide me! Hide me!  Squidward! Squidward! I've gone blind!  Oh. Thanks, Squidward.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you always over-react to everything. It's one of your many annoying traits.\nSpongeBob: Me? Annoying?  Yeah, right.\nSquidward: You are so wrong about everything, SpongeBob, that the only thing that I am completely sure about is that there is no motorcycle gang headed this way.  What was that?\nMr. Krabs: Ahoy there, mateys. Motorized vehicles headed over the horizon.\nSquidward: What?  Gimme that.  Don't just stand there, save us!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I know this looks like the end, but you and I can get through anything. As long as we do it together.  Patrick? Patrick!  Well, it's just you and me, Squidward. But I want you to know that we can get through this. As long as we...\nSquidward: Panic! Run for your lives!  The Wild Ones are coming!\nLenny: The Wild Ones?  Mable, get the kids!\nCharlie: Honey, I got the napkins. Oh, what have I missed this time?\nSquidward: Please don't kill me. I want to join you. It's been my life-long dream to be to be a member of a motorcycle gang. I even knitted my own Wild Ones jacket.  I want to ride to live and live to ride.  I'll do whatever you want. I'll betray my friends and neighbors. Just let me live.\nBiker #1: What's that, missy?\nBiker #2: What?\nBiker #1: Howdy, we're the \"Mild Ones\".\nSpongeBob: Mild Ones?  Oh!\nBiker #1: Gimme back my M. Let's go, boys.\nMr. Krabs: Don't you want to spend any money?\nBiker #1: Don't you want to kiss the seat of my pants? Let's ride.\nSpongeBob: Goodbye. They seem really nice. Hey, where's Squidward?\nSquidward: Woo-hoo-hoo!  Ride to live and live to ride!\n","78b\nBest Frenemies\nMr. Krabs: No, it's impossible. I must've counted me money a dozen times, and it still comes up short. Profits are down. Oh, I feel sorry for me self.\nSquidward: Would you like a drink with that order?\nMartin: Oh no, thanks. I got me one of those new KelpShakes before I came in here.\nSquidward: That comes out to two dollars even.\nMartin: Wow, what a steal.\nMr. Krabs: What the...why didn't that guy order a deliciously over-priced fountain beverage with his krabby patty?\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs, we haven't sold a single soda in days.\nMr. Krabs: What? Why not?  All right, boy, it's done! You're gonna suck the whole cup down your gullet if you're not careful.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr Krabs, it's just that this KelpShake tastes so good.\nMr. Krabs: KelpShake?\nSpongeBob: Look around ya. Everyone's enjoying a delicious KelpShake.  Mm-mm. I'll be right back, Mr Krabs. I'm gonna get a refill.\nMr. Krabs: Refill? That's it. Listen up, everybody! New rule: No outside drinks. No exceptions!\nSquidward: That's telling them.\nMr. Krabs: Grr. I better get to the bottom of this.  Ah! A new store!  On my block! Taking my customers.  Pearl.  Me own flesh and blood. How could you do this to your papa?\nPearl: What are you talking about, Dad?\nMr. Krabs: I'm talking about this.\nPearl: Once you taste the secret goodness of a KelpShake...  You can't have just one.\nMr. Krabs: Let me see that.\nPearl: Buy your own.\nMr. Krabs: Why I wouldn't give them a cent.\nPearl: I feel sorry for you.\nMr. Krabs: Then you do understand.\nPearl: Dad, you're embarrassing me.  Oh, get away.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, no! Confound you, new KelpShake store. What's your secret?  Of course. Plankton, I bet he's behind this. A-ha! I knew you were behind this!\nPlankton: Pardon me, I've done nothing wrong.\nMr. Krabs: Then how do you explain this?\nPlankton: Holy Moley, how'd that happen?\nMr. Krabs: Don't try that with me, Plankton. This new store is ruining me business.\nPlankton: Really?! Wait a minute! That's my job!  Blast it! It's bad enough I have to compete with this joker. Now there's this?! KelpShakes.\nMr. Krabs: Wow. I guess you're really not behind this after all. Plankton, they have... a secret formuler.\nPlankton: No, not another secret. And if there's a secret, I want to know about it!\nMr. Krabs: Oh!\nPlankton: They're multiplying. Why, they're on every corner.\nMr. Krabs: Block after block.\nPlankton: They're everywhere.\nMr. Krabs: We've got to do something about this.  You sure this is going to work?\nPlankton: Just stick to the plan.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, let's see, let's see. Ah, there you are.  Plankton, I think I found the kitchen.\nPlankton: Let's do this thing!\nMr. Krabs: Here goes. Wa-choo!  I'm sorry, I have a bit of a  ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...choo!!\nEmployee: Eww.\nPlankton: My eye, my eye, my eye!\nMr. Krabs: I think we lost them. Well, you got any more bright ideas?\nPlankton: Of course I do.\nMr. Krabs: All set, Plankton?\nPlankton: You better believe it. This high-powered mechanical bio-arm I invented should pry those restaurant doors open nice and easy.  What the barnacles? Come on, you piece of garbage.  Ouch! Uncle! Uncle!\nMr. Krabs: If you want anything done right, you've got to do it yourself.  Oh, me back.\nPlankton: Krabs, pipe down. You're gonna soil our plans if you wake up the watchdog.\nMr. Krabs: Never mind that. What about SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Hi, Mr Krabs. Hi...Plankton? Uh, Mr Krabs, I'm a little confused. Don't you and Plankton hate each other?\nMr. Krabs: Of course we do.\nSpongeBob: Then why is he in your fist?\nMr. Krabs: Uh...we've gone into business together. You see, SpongeBob, we were hired, uh...to fix this door.\nPlankton: Now we have to fix the roof.\nMr. Krabs: That's right. That's right. We have to fix the roof. It's, it's, it's leaking.\nSpongeBob: Well, good luck with that. See ya.\nPlankton: Keep her going, Krabs. At this rate, we'll have the Kelpshake's recipe faster than you can say...\nSpeaker: You have three seconds before spontaneous combustion.\nPlankton: Let's beat it!\nMr. Krabs: No kidding.\nPlankton: Wait, you forgotten...  I'm throwing in the towel, Krabs! All these convoluted plans are getting us nowhere. And to top it all off, I'm the only one that's taking the heat!\nMr. Krabs: What's that suppose to mean?\nPlankton: I don't see you on the front lines. Sure, let me do all the work, while you just sit back like the fat gorilla you are!!\nMr. Krabs: Who you are calling a gorilla, you one-cent, one-eyed bottom-feeder!?\nSpongeBob: Mr Krabs, if you want a KelpShake, why don't you just buy one?\nMr. Krabs: Buy one?\nCustomer: I'll have one KelpShake, please.\nMr. Krabs: I don't know about this, Plankton.\nPlankton: It's easy. Just smile and hand the cashier the money.\nCashier: Can I help you?\nPlankton: Good luck.\nMr. Krabs: Hi there. Uh, could I get one KelpShake?\nCashier: Sure, that'll be one dollar.\nMr. Krabs: Uh, okay.\nCashier: Thank you.  Sir, please let go of the bill.\nPlankton: Release your grip, man. Do it!\nCashier: Enjoy.\nMr. Krabs: Thanks.  I can't believe we did it.\nPlankton: Oh, believe it, Krabs. Now let's get to the lab and find out what this stuff is made of.  What's the secret ingredient, Karen?\nKaren: Well, it appears that the main ingredient is, Kelp Juice.\nPlankton & Mr. Krabs: Just kelp juice?\nMr. Krabs: And to think this whole time I could've been selling these meself!\nPlankton: You? What about me? If anyone, I deserve to make a buck of selling this stuff.\nMr. Krabs: No way, pipsqueak. This gold mine is mine.\nPlankton: Not if I can help it.  Ow.\nMr. Krabs: Nice try.\nKaren: I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's another ingredient.\nMr. Krabs: Hey, I paid good money for this thing. Of course I'm gonna drink it.  What the...? I don't get what the big deal is. This tastes like a wet gym sock.\nPlankton: Really? Let me try that.  Actually, there is a bit of a pungent aftertaste.\nMr. Krabs: Hmmm.  Hey, you're right. This ain't half bad.  This is amazing.\nPlankton: Well, don't be selfish.  Oh yeah.\nKaren: Oh no.\nPlankton: Krabs, we're all out of juice.\nMr. Krabs: Well, we gotta get more.\nKaren: You're making a big mistake.\nMr. Krabs: Ah, phooey. You don't know what you're talking about.  KelpShake, KelpShake. Oh how I love a KelpShake.\nSpongeBob: What's happening to me?  They've shutdown the KelpShake restaurants!\nPlankton & Mr. Krabs: Huh?\nHazmat #1: It'll take decades to clean this hazardous material up.\nHazmat #2: I sure do feel sorry for whoever drank this.\nPlankton: Look at us!\nMr. Krabs: Now what are we going to do?\nPlankton: I don't know about you,  but I'm going back to what I do best. Stealing your recipe.\nMr. Krabs: Hey, wait a minute! Plankton!\nPlankton: Come to papa.\nMr. Krabs: Hold it right there. You're not going anywhere...  without a ten second head start.\nPlankton: It's good to be home.\nMr. Krabs: You said it.\nPlankton: I love being hated.\nMr. Krabs: Hey, get back here you little booger!\n","79a\nThe Pink Purloiner\nSpongeBob: You know, Patrick, the Jellyfish migration is my favorite time of year! For three whole days, jellyfish from around the globe gather on one spot to trade jelly secrets.  Patrick, look! It's a blue-crested blaster! I've never seen one before! They're really rare. And a speckled squirter, a two fisted Jumper, and a gold-throated stinger!\nGold Throated Singer: La, la, la, la, la, la, la!\nSpongeBob: Oh, this year's migration is gonna be a big one!\nPatrick: Uhh, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Wow. This looks like a job for Ol' Reliable!\nSpongeBob: Ah, that was the most beautiful day of jellyfishing ever.\nPatrick: Well, I didn't catch a thing with my dumb old net.\nSpongeBob: Lucky for me, I have Ol' Reliable! Carbon fiber handle, titanium alloid netting and form-fitting silicone grips. Yes, sir, Ol' Reliable is the best net in the world.\nPatrick: Wow! I would kill for a net like that! You know, something small like a carrot. But not spiders, they're icky.\nSpongeBob: Good night, Patrick.\nPatrick: Good night, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Ah, I love jellyfishing.  Whoo! Time to get ready for day two of the jellyfish migration. And I'll start with my trusty jellyfishing net, Ol' Reliable.  Ol' Reliable?  It's gone!\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: Oh, right. Pants.\nNarrator: One pair of pants later...\nSpongeBob: Patrick, Ol' Reliable has been stolen!\nSpongeBob: Put one over there, Patrick.\nPatrick: I'm all done.\nSpongeBob: Maybe we should spread out a little.\nJohnny: Flash. The jellyfish migration enters it second day of fantastic jellyfishing. We now go live to our reporter on the scene.\nPerch Perkins: This year's migration is the largest in a century! I feel truly sorry for the poor saps that will miss even one minute of this remarkable event.\nSpongeBob: Attention, Bikini Bottom, my jellyfishing net has been stolen. I am prepared to offer a large reward for its safe return.\nMr. Krabs: Reward? How much we talkin' about?\nSpongeBob: 12 dollars and...  ...38 cents.\nMr. Krabs: I'm on the case.\nPerch Perkins: Guys, I know it's a slow news day, but come on.\nSpongeBob: Oh! Hello? Hello?\nPatrick: SpongeBob, did you get your net back?\nSpongeBob: Oh, get off the line, Patrick. Someone might be trying to call about Ol' Reliable!\nPatrick: Oh, sorry.  Did you get your net yet?\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. Don't call unless you found my net.\nSpongeBob: Hello?!\nPatrick: SpongeBob, I found your net!\nSpongeBob: What?! Really, Patrick?\nPatrick: Uhh, oh, not really. I just got lonely.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I'll never get my net back. I'll just have to accept that Ol' Reliable is gone forever.\nSpongeBob: Patrick's lucky. He gets to practice in the middle of the night with his jellyfish net.  Funny thing is, Patrick's net disintegrated yesterday.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, did you get Ol' Reliable back yet?\nSpongeBob: No, not yet. Hey, Patrick, wouldn't it be the funniest thing if you had taken my jellyfish net?\nPatrick: No.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, that would be silly. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a present.\nPatrick: A present? What is it?\nSpongeBob: It's a Confess-A-Bear. He's a special friend you tell all your secrets to.\nPatrick: Wow, thanks, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: I'll just leave you two alone to get acquainted.\nSpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Hi! My name is Confess-A-Bear! Tell me all your secrets.\nPatrick: Um,  I did something recently I'm not very proud of. I didn't mean to do it. It just sort of happened.\nSpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Oh, maybe you should talk about it.\nPatrick: Well, it involves my best friend SpongeBob. I don't think he knows what happened, but it would really upset him if he found out.\nSpongeBob/Confess-A-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear!\nPatrick: I've said too much already.\nSpongeBob/Confess-a-Bear: Tell Confess-A-Bear now! Now!\nPatrick: Ahh! I accidentally knocked SpongeBob's toothbrush in the toilet and put it back on the counter without washing it! Confess-A-Bear?  You're mad at me, aren't you, Confess-A-Bear?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, we need to talk.\nPatrick: Uh, don't come in! I'm not decent! The house is a mess! There's a radiation leak!\nSpongeBob: Hmmm...  Patrick, where are you? Why are the lights off?\nPatrick: I'm in here. Be out in a second.\nSpongeBob: Ol' Reliable! Ah...ha.\nPatrick: Hello.\nSpongeBob: What's in your hand, Patrick?\nPatrick: Nothing.\nSpongeBob: What's in your other hand?\nPatrick: Nothing in my other hand.\nSpongeBob: Well, I gotta go.\nPatrick: Okay, bye.\nSpongeBob: Patrick wouldn't steal Ol' Reliable. Would he?\nPatrick: I would kill for a net like that!\nSpongeBob: Have I been best friends with a master thief? I must know for sure.

See ya later, Patrick.\nPatrick: Bye.\nSpongeBob: Now, we'll just see what sort of nothing you're really up to, Sneaky McSneakyPants.\nNarrator: Eight hours later...\nSpongeBob: Oh, he is good. You never really know a guy until you stare at him for eight hours through high-powered binoculars. Hey, where'd he go?\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob. What are you doing?\nSpongeBob: Uh, you... what the...? What are you doing?\nPatrick: Nothing. I just finished.  Oh, hey, look. You can see where I was just standing from here. Boy, if you wanted to, you could have spied on me all day from right here.  Creepy, huh? Anyway, what are you doing with those binoculars?\nSpongeBob: I don't have any binoculars, see?\nPatrick: You're acting weird.\nSpongeBob: I'm not acting weird! You're acting weird!  You're... acting... weird!\nPatrick: Okay, bye!  Hello! Who are you?\nSpongeBob: Greetings, young fellow! I am willing to pay top dollar for jellyfishing items with sentimental value, if you know what I mean.\nPatrick: Oh. No.\nSpongeBob: Word on the street is that you know where to get quality jellyfishing supplies hmm.\nPatrick: What street said that? Was it this one?  Mind your own business!\nSpongeBob: Oh Mr. Star, I know that you are in possession of a rare jellyfishing net.  I will pay one billion dollars for that net.\nPatrick: I don't know who you are, but you're not getting this jellyfishing net!  I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars, not for a hundred dollars, I wouldn't even sell it for a dollar!\nSpongeBob: Oh, really?\nPatrick: You can't have it for any price.\nSpongeBob: And why not?\nPatrick: This means more to me than money. It's my friend SpongeBob's.\nSpongeBob: A-ha!\nPatrick: SpongeBob! Oh, thank goodness you're here. There was this scary guy with a mustache asking a lot of weird questions.\nSpongeBob: Patrick,  I'm the scary mustache guy!\nPatrick: Why, SpongeBob, why? Why would you wear such a scary mustache?\nSpongeBob: Why did you steal my jellyfishing net?\nPatrick: What?! I'm your best friend!\nSpongeBob: You were my best friend, you no-good jellyfish net thief!\nPatrick: How could you think that?\nSpongeBob: Because you said it! You said that it was your friend SpongeBob's!\nPatrick: Gift.\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: It's my friend SpongeBob's gift.  I made you a new net.\nSpongeBob: For SpongeBob. You made me a new jellyfishing net? That is so thoughtful of you. Patrick?\nSpongeBob: What'cha doing, best friend?\nPatrick: I'm not your best friend. I'm just a no-good jelly netting thief fish!\nSpongeBob: Where are you going?\nPatrick: I'm leaving Bikini Bottom while I still have my dignity.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, no!  So, this is it?\nPatrick: Barring the unforeseen hand of fate, I'm afraid it is.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, don't go. I'm sorry I accused you. It's bad enough I lost my net. I don't want to lose my friend, too. Please forgive me.\nNat Peterson: What's the holdup? Oh, it's you two.  Look, you left your net on the bus again.\nSpongeBob: Ol' Reliable? I left you on the bus?\nNat Peterson: You do it every week. Now can we get going?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I want you to take this to remember me by.\nPatrick: You're giving me Ol' Reliable?  I accept your apology!\nSpongeBob: Oh, come here, you big lug!\nAll: Aww...\nNat Peterson: They do this all the time. I'm serious. I--ugh, never mind.\nPatrick: I'm staying in Bikini Bottom!\nPassengers: Hooray!\nPatrick: You want to go jellyfishing? I just got a new net.\nSpongeBob: So did I.

Hi, Squidward, wanna play hide-and-seek?\nSquidward: Okay, SpongeBob, you hide first.  Oh, no, where'd he go? I guess he wins.  Defeat has never tasted so sweet.  Yello?\nSpongeBob: How 'bout a game of hangman?\nSquidward: How 'bout a game of hang up?  Well, I guess this brings an end to my luxuriating.\nSpongeBob: How about Duck, Duck, Hermit Krab? Hopscotch? Squidward Says? Steal the Bacon? Sleeping Sea Lions? Sharks & Minnows? Sink the Submarine? Kings & Queens? Mahjong?  Whoa, I've never played this game before. What's it called?\nSquidward: It's called, \"I will never play with you...  ...ever!\"\nSpongeBob: Something tells me Squidward doesn't wanna play today. That's it.

Finally, a server with a good attitude.\nMini Squid: Well, thank you very much.\nSandals: I'll take eight dozen of your finest patties, please. But don't let old chowder pants over there touch them. He might taint the patties.\nSquidward: Fine then. Do my work for me.\nSquidward: I'm starting to like this Mini Squid doing my work, keeping SpongeBob off my back.

Why take a cheap knock off when you can have the original.\nSquidward: Now, where do I sign?\nMilo: Yeah, right, kid!\nSpongeBob: Well, ol' Mini Squidward, I guess this is it. We've had some good times playing charades and dancing around like two giddy butterflies!  Remember?\nMini Squid: Yep, those were the days.\nSpongeBob: But I guess it's time for you to move on, huh? Onto greener pastures. Arrivederci, mon frere.\nMilo: Alright, kid, let's go become a sensation. Oh, and I'll see you at the Clammy Awards. Oh no, I guess I won't.\nSpongeBob: Bye-bye! What's the matter, actual-size Squidward?\nSquidward: My dreams are crushed. But, hey, at least I won't have to see that Mini Squid ever again!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I have something even better!  Another me!\n","80a\nBest Day Ever\nSpongeBob: \u266aMr. Sun came up, and he smiled at me.

Because, Gary, I get to start this wonderful day bringing life to a whole new generation of delicious Krabby Patties, followed by a vigorous mid-day session of karate with Sandy, and an afternoon jellyfishing with Patrick, where I'll unveil my newest, most prized possession: the Deluxe Jelly Slayer Composite Pro! And for the grand finale, every one of my closest friends joining together for Squidward's clarinet recital.

Take them devil sons of the sea away from me restaurant!\nSpongeBob: Whoa! I gotta get to Sandy's!  Wait \u2018til Sandy gets a load of these adhesive karate gloves. Hyah!  Hyah!\nSandy: SpongeBob, what on Earth are you doing?!\nSpongeBob: Oh, just a little something I like to call karate.\nSandy: I can't right now, SpongeBob. I got a leak in my roof the size of a full-grown quarter horse!\nSpongeBob: Mm-hmm. I see. Okay, then I'll come back later.\nSandy: Knock... it... off!  It stopped? SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\nSandy: Hang on. I'm going to get some sealant and patch and trowel!\nSpongeBob: Oh.  Oh. No Krabby Patties, no karate. At least I have jellyfishing with...

No work, no karate, no jellyfishing. Hey, I still have Squidward's concert! I won't let this one slip through my fingers.  Hey, Squidward. Squidward, what's wrong?\nSquidward: The concert is ruined. My reed is shot.  See? I'm finished.\nSpongeBob: Pull yourself together, man! I came for here a concert, and darn it, I am gonna get one!\nSquidward: But my reed!\nSpongeBob: Now play!\nSquidward: But...\nSpongeBob: I said play!\nSquidward: Not bad.\nSpongeBob: Now get in there and give me a concert to remember.\nUsher: Where do you think you're going, kid?\nSpongeBob: I'm going to see Squidward play his clarinet.

Then everything turned to doo-doo.\nMr. Krabs: It's okay, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: No, it's not okay!  This was going to be my best day ever, starting with doing the best job in the world: working at the Krusty Krab.\nMr. Krabs: Boy, you saved me barnacle the way you put the run on them nematodes.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I guess so. But then I was going to do karate with Sandy.\nSandy: I know, but you saved the treedome! Pretty cool, if you ask me.\nSpongeBob: Well, I suppose. But then I was going to go jellyfishing with Patrick.\nPatrick: But then you... Uh, what'd you do again?\nSquidward: And, I hate to admit it, but I suppose if you hadn't fixed my reed, the concert would have been a bust.\nMr. Krabs: You see, SpongeBob, it's not about you or your perfect day or any of those things.\nSpongeBob: It's not?\nMr. Krabs: No.  It's about us!\nSpongeBob: It is?\nMr. Krabs: Yep. And since you did such a good job, we wanna make it up to you.\nSpongeBob: You do?\nMr. Krabs: So, just tell us anything your little heart desires, and it's yours.  Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the Bikini Bottom Players proudly present a very expensive production of... \"The Best Day Ever.\" And it better be good for all it's costing me.\nSpongeBob: \u266aMy perfect job starts my perfect day.\u266a  \u266aThen it's time to kick back, relax and play.\u266a\nMr. Krabs: That wasn't in the budget!\nSpongeBob: \u266aSing along.

Happy Best Friend...whoa.\nPatrick: This chewing gum is my most beloved possession, and I'm giving it to my bestest friend, on Best Friends Day.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I am truly honored and...\nPatrick: What's wrong, buddy?\nSpongeBob: You got me such an amazing gift, and all I got you was...that.\nRobo 2.1: Greetings. I am Robo 2.1, your personal robot servant. I am proficient in providing over 250,000 creature comforts. Would you care for a pastry?\nPatrick: Yum. Sweet, hot, and juicy. SpongeBob, this is a great gift!\nSpongeBob: Well, thanks for your appreciation, Patrick, but it's no giant, old, used ball of gum.\nPatrick: Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, SpongeBob. I love my gift. In fact, I'll go play with it right now. Come on, Robo.\nRobo 2.1: Coming, Master Patrick.\nPatrick: Oh, SpongeBob, you don't mind if I say goodbye to Gummy, do you?\nSpongeBob: No, not at all.\nPatrick: Thanks. Goodbye, Gummy. You be good to SpongeBob, you hear?  I love you, too, Gummy.  Well, he's all yours.\nSpongeBob: O, majestic and much masticated Gummy, although I am not worthy to be in your presence, may my humble abode please you.  Oh, you sure are a big boy, aren't you? Ooh. Hey, I know how to handle this. With a little karate! Hyah!  Ooh. Oh, Gummy, what a beautiful centerpiece you make. With your dirty sock and used toothbrush, flies, and moldy pizza.  Get a hold of yourself, SpongeBob. It's not so bad. After all, it is a gift from Patrick.\nUnderwear: You're...not Patrick.\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Patrick, but your gift has got to go!  Goodbye, stink ball. See ya never!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, whatcha doing?\nRobo 2.1: It appears that he is throwing Gummy away.\nPatrick: What? Is that true?\nSpongeBob: No way, Patrick.\nPatrick: Well, how do you explain this?\nSpongeBob: Well, you see, I liked Gummy and I decided to dress him up.  Isn't this a cute look?\nPatrick: Hmmm. Bold yet understated. Brilliant idea, SpongeBob. Keep up the good work. Come on, Robo, let's find more belly button lint.\nSpongeBob: Okay, no sign of Patrick. Better make this fast.  Get ready for your dirt nap, Gummy!\nPatrick: SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm waiting.\nSpongeBob: Uh... I was digging a hole so I could get a better view of Gummy because he is so attractive and... Allow me to demonstrate.  See, Patrick, the view is beautiful down here!\nPatrick: Yeah, he does look rather dashing from this angle. Be that as it may, Gummy must be displayed properly and proudly. And I know just the place.  Isn't he breathtaking? All right, SpongeBob, we got to go. I'm gonna learn how to use a fork. Right, Robo?\nRobo 2.1: It will be my pleasure, master.\nPatrick: By the way, your house looks a million times better.\nSpongeBob: Thanks.  Oh, what am I going to do, Gary? It's hideous.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Wishful thinking, Gary. What burglar would want to steal that thing?  Shhh.\nFish: Who are you?

How long you've been stuck there, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: All day.\nSandy: Well, your old pal, Sandy knows how to cut you down.\nSpongeBob: No, wait, Sandy. The more you touch it, the angrier it gets.\nSandy: Oh, that's just crazy talk. Hyah!\nSpongeBob: Told ya. Save yourself, Sandy. Run away before you end up like me!\nSandy: Oh, come on now, there's got to be a way.  I've got an idea.  Hang on tight, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, all righty.\nTruck Driver: Come on, Ol' Blue!

Of course.\nSandy: I'm okay.\nPatrick: What's this? SpongeBob, what have you done?\nSpongeBob: Now, Patrick, I can explain.\nPatrick: It's-it's...it's amazing! It's like a gummy wonderland! Whee! Wow, I wish I were having this much fun. I knew you'd love it.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I have something to tell you.\nRobo 2.1: Would you care for a massage, Master?\nPatrick: Enough already. Sheesh. So, you were saying something, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Uh, well, how can I put this?\nPatrick: Aw, just come right out and...  Will you stop? Just stop.\nSquidward: Get on with it, SpongeBob!\nSandy: Wrap it up.\nPatrick: Squidward? Sandy? Gee, everyone is having fun with my Gummy but me. I-I-I mean, your Gummy.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, do you miss your Gummy?\nPatrick: Uh-huh.\nSpongeBob: Well, it's still Best Friends Day. How would you like your Gummy back?\nPatrick: Yes!\nSpongeBob: It's yours, buddy. But first, you got to get us out of this.\nPatrick: Oh, that's easy.  I told you it was easy.  Wow!

But why?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility.

I wish to speak to my daughter alone.  What is this, Mindy?\nMindy: Your crown?\nNeptune: And what does this crown do?\nMindy: It covers your bald spot.\nNeptune: It's not bald! It's... thinning. This crown does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline.  No, this crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. One day, you will wear this crown.\nMindy: I'm gonna be bald?!\nNeptune: Thinning! Anyway, the point is, you won't wear it until you learn how to rule with an iron fist. Like your father.\nMindy: Dad, your \"crown\"...\nNeptune: What the...?  My crown! Aah! Someone has stolen the royal crown!\nPlankton: I got it. I got it!\nGoofy Goober Clock: Hey, all you Goobers, it's time to say howdy to your favorite undersea peanut, Goofy Goober.\nKids: Howdy, Goofy Goober!\nGoofy Goober: Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers.

Wow, the pressure's already setting in.\nSpongeBob: No, Pat, you don't understand. I didn't get the promotion.\nPatrick: What? Why?\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.\nPatrick: What?! That's insane!\nSpongeBob: I know.\nPatrick: Well, saying you're a kid, it's like saying I'm a kid!\nWaiter: Here's your Goober Meal, sir.\nPatrick: I'm supposed to get a toy with this.  Thanks.\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna head home, Pat. The celebration's off.\nPatrick: Are you sure?\nSpongeBob: Yeah.

Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Now, pay attention, Squidward. As new manager, you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers.\nSquidward: Yawn.\nMr. Krabs: What's this? King Neptune is riding toward the Krusty Krab at lunchtime! He's got money!\nNeptune: Stay in the coach, daughter.  This won't take long.\nMindy: Daddy, please. I think you're overreacting.\nNeptune: Silence, Mindy. I know what I'm doing.  Ow! Squire!\nSquire: Yes, Your Highness?\nNeptune: Have this pole executed at once.\nSquidward: A hundred and one dollars for a Krabby Patty?\nMr. Krabs: With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese.\nNeptune: Greeting, subjects. I seek the one known as Eugene Krabs. May he present himself to me at once.\nMr. Krabs: I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness. Would you like to order something?\nNeptune: Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs! You have stolen the royal crown, you cannot deny. For, clever as you are, you left one damning piece of evidence at the scene of the crime.\nMr. Krabs: \"I stole your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs?!\"\nNeptune: Relinquish the royal crown to me at once!\nMr. Krabs: But... But this is crazy! I didn't do it!\nThe Phone: Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs. Leave a message.\nClay: Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay, the guy you sold Neptune's crown to. Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown. I sold it to a guy in Shell City, and I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown.  Which is now in Shell City. Goodbye.\nMr. Krabs: Heh, heh... Don't you just hate wrong numbers?\nNeptune: My crown is in the forbidden Shell City?!\nPlankton: Plan Z. I love Plan Z.\nKing Neptune: Prepare to burn, Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Wait, Neptune! Please, I'm begging you! I ain't a crook! Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me!\nKing Neptune: Very well, then. Before I turn this conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anything to say about Eugene Krabs?\nSpongeBob: I've got something to say about Mr.  Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, you've come just in time. Please, tell King Neptune all about me.\nSpongeBob: I have worked for Mr. Krabs for many years and always thought he was a great boss.\nMr. Krabs: You see? A great boss.\nSpongeBob: I now realize that he's a GREAT BIG JERK! I deserve that manager's job! But you didn't give it to me, because you say I'm a kid. Well, I am 100% man! And this man has got something to say to you.  There, I think I made my point.\nKing Neptune: Anyone else? No? Well, then.\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nMr. Krabs: Ooh! Me pants are on fire! Me underwear's on fire! I'm on fire!  Oh, yeah.\nKing Neptune: And now, Eugene Krabs,  you... will...\nSpongeBob: Wait! I'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.\nKing Neptune: Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City. That's why he must die.\nSpongeBob: Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?\nKing Neptune: You don't understand. My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority. And between you and me... my hair is thinning a bit.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that noticeable... Bald! Bald!}}\nFred: My eyes!\nKing Neptune: All right, all right.\nSpongeBob: King Neptune, sir? Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get your crown back?\nKing Neptune: You, go to Shell City?  No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned. What makes you think you could? You're just a kid.\nSpongeBob: But I'm not a kid. I can do it.\nKing Neptune: Run along. I have a crab to cook.\nSpongeBob: No! I won't let you.\nKing Neptune: Very well, then. I'll have to fry you both!\nMindy: Daddy, stop it! Can't you get through one day without executing someone?\nKing Neptune: Mindy, I told you to stay in the carriage.\nMindy: Where's your love and compassion?  Look at this little guy. He's willing to risk his life to find your crown and save his boss.\nKing Neptune: But, daughter, I...\nMindy: Please, Father? At least let him try. What have you got to lose? Might I remind you of your special problem?\nAll: Bald! Bald! Bald!\nFred: My eyes!\nKing Neptune: All right. Very well, Mindy. I'll give him a chance. But when your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter this crab all over the walls.\nMr. Krabs: Huh?\nKing Neptune: And as for you, be back here with my crown in exactly 10 days!\nPatrick: He can do it in 9!\nKing Neptune: 8!\nPatrick: 7!\nKing Neptune: 6!\nSpongeBob & Mr. Krabs: Patrick!\nKing Neptune: Six it is, then.\nPatrick: Fi--ve.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, shush!\nKing Neptune: Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands!\nMr. Krabs: No, wait! I'm begging you!\nSquidward: Who turned on the AC?  Mr. Krabs! Oh, no, this is terrible! Who's gonna sign my paycheck?\nKing Neptune: Come along, Mindy.\nMindy: Listen, you guys, the road to Shell City is really dangerous. There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere. And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops  who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures. Don't let him catch you, because if he does, he'll take you back to his lair, and you'll never be seen again.\nPatrick: She's pretty, SpongeBob.\nMindy: Here, take this.\nSpongeBob: What's in here?\nMindy: It's a magical bag of winds. I stole them from my father.\nPatrick: You're hot.\nMindy: Once you find the crown, open the bag of winds and you'll be blown back home.\nNeptune: Mindy!\nMindy: I'm coming. Good luck, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Wait. How did you know my name?\nMindy: Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. I've learned the names of all the sea creatures.\nPatrick: What's my name?\nMindy: That's easy. You're Patrick Star.\nNeptune: Mindy!\nMindy: I gotta go. I believe in you guys.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, Mindy.  Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward and I...\nSquidward: Pass.\nSpongeBob: Patrick and I...\nPatrick: Hi.\nSpongeBob: ... are gonna get that crown back and save you from Neptune's wrath. You've got nothing to worry about. Your life is in our hands.  Patrick, let's go get that crown!\nSpongeBob: Feast your eyes, Patrick.\nPatrick: What is it?\nSpongeBob: The Patty Wagon. Mr. Krabs uses it for promotional reasons. Let me show you some of its features. Sesame-seed finish, steel-belted pickles, grilled-leather interior. And under the hood, a fuel-injected French-fryer with dual overhead grease traps.\nPatrick: Wow!\nSpongeBob: Yeah, wow!\nPatrick: Hey, I thought you didn't have a driver's license.\nSpongeBob: You don't need a license to drive a sandwich.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Shell City, here we come!\nPlankton: Ding-a-ling. Hey there, old buddy.  Freeze.  One secret formula to go, please. No, no, don't trouble yourself. I'll get it. Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make... over at the Chum Bucket. Plan Z, I love ya!\nSpongeBob & Patrick: \u266aOh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!\u266a\nSpongeBob: Fill her up, please.\nFloyd: What'll it be, fellas? Mustard... or ketchup?!\nPatrick: Are they laughing at us?\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. They're laughing next to us.\nFloyd: Where you two dumb kids headed, anyway?\nPatrick: Kids?!\nSpongeBob: Now, Patrick. For your information, we are not kids. We are men. And we're off to get King Neptune's crown in Shell City.\nFloyd and Lloyd: Shell City?\nLloyd: Ain't that the place that's guarded by a killer Cyclops?\nSpongeBob: That's right.\nFloyd: Lloyd, take off your hat in respect. Respect for the dead!\nFloyd: You two dipsticks ain't gonna last 10 seconds over the county line!\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.\nBoat jacker: Out of the car, fellas.\nSpongeBob: How many seconds was that?\nLloyd: Twelve.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: In your face!\nSpongeBob: That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!\nPatrick: Who's the kid now?\nFloyd: They're dead.\nPerch Perkins: Perch Perkins here with an incredible news flash. Plankton is selling Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket. How is this possible? Let's find out.\nPlankton: Step right up. Plenty for everybody.\nPerch Perkins: Excuse me, Plankton. Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News. Can I get a minute?\nPlankton: Anything for you, Perch.\nPerch Perkins: All of Bikini Bottom wants to know, how did you get the Krabby Patty?\nPlankton: Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune...  I'm sorry. He confided in me a secret wish. \"Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket,\" he said. \"Don't let the flame die out.\"  By the way, act now and you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase. Here you go, Perch.\nPerch Perkins: Thanks.\nPlankton: Bucket helmets for everyone!\nMan: My helmet!\nPlankton: Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy since the day you agreed to be my wife.\nKaren: I never agreed.\nPlankton: Evil Plan Z is working perfectly. Nothing can stop me now!\nKaren: Nothing except SpongeBob and his pink friend.  My sensors indicate that they're going after the crown. If they make it back, Neptune might discover some fingerprints. Tiny fingerprints. Stubby, tiny fingerprints.\nPlankton: Evil Plan Z is way ahead of you, baby. I've already hired someone to take care of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator!\nDennis: Sesame seed.\nFloyd: Hey, mister, does that hat take ten gallons?\nPatrick: Going on.\nSpongeBob: Yeah! Moving on. Just keep going.\nPatrick: Yup.\nSpongeBob: Gonna get that crown.\nPatrick: Oh, yeah. All right.\nSpongeBob: Yeah. Victory.\nPatrick: Are we there yet?\nSpongeBob: We must be close by now...Patrick, look.  We're doing great! Shell City's only five days away!\nPatrick: By car.\nSpongeBob: I wish we still had our car.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, look! Our car!\nSpongeBob: The key!\nPatrick: Where do you think it is?\nSpongeBob: There it is, Pat. The key! Now, how are we gonna get it?\nPatrick: I know. Walk in and ask him for it.\nThug: What are you looking at?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, that's a terrible idea.\nPatrick: Sorry.\nSpongeBob: I know. I'll go in and create a distraction, and you get the key.\nPatrick: Ooh! Ooh! Wait!, I wanna do the distraction!\nSpongeBob: Okay... I guess it really doesn't matter who does the distraction.\nThug in background: You see me walkin' back?!\nPatrick: Ahem! Can I have everybody's attention?  I have to use the bathroom.\nBoat jacker: It's, uhh...right over there.\nSpongeBob: Stupid contacts.  Oh, there it is. I better go wash it off.\nSpongeBob: Patrick! You call that a distraction?!\nPatrick: Well, I had to go to the bathroom.\nSpongeBob: Well, I got my hands dirty for nothing.  Patrick, check it out!\nPatrick: Whoa.\nBoth: Hooray! Bubble party!\nVictor: Hey! Who blew this bubble?!  You all know the rules!\nEverybody in the main area of the Thug Tug: All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bodied patron in the bar.\nOne Patron: ...bar.\nVictor: That's right! So who blew it?!\nVictor: So... Nobody knows?\nTough Guy #1: Maybe it was...\nVictor: Shut up!  Somebody in here ain't a real man.  You! We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out. Now, everybody line up! DJ! Time for the test.  No baby can resist singing along to this.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober theme song.\nSpongeBob: I know!\nGoofy Goober: \u266aOh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!\u266a\nVictor: It was you! You're the baby!\nTough Guy #2: No, no! I only coughed, I swear!\nVictor: DJ! Turn it up louder!\nSpongeBob: Don't sing along, Patrick!\nPatrick: I'm trying. Trying so hard.\nVictor: \u266aI'm a Goofy Goober, yeah! You're a Goofy Goober, yeah! We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah!\u266a\nSiamese Twins: \u266aGoofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah!\u266a\nVictor: Well, well, well. Which one of you babies was it?!\nSiamese Twins: Uh.. It was him! He did it. I've never even eaten at... \u266aGoofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah!\u266a\nVictor: Well, looks like we got ourselves a double baby!\nSpongeBob: Man, that was a close call.\nPatrick: Guess what I got.\nSpongeBob: The key! Shhh...\nSquidward: Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.\nNat: Morning.\nSquidward: Some people have no taste in headgear.  Huh? Babies too?  Excuse me, miss, but where is everybody getting that horrid headwear?\nEvelyn: Who said that?\nSquidward: Down here.\nEvelyn: Oh! Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket. Plankton's giving them away free with every Krabby Patty.\nSquidward: Chum Bucket?... Free?... Krabby Patty?... Plankton?... Giving?... With?\nSquidward: So you're selling Krabby Patties, eh, Plankton?\nPlankton: That's right, Squidward.  And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. Care for one?\nSquidward: No. You may have hoodwinked everyone else in this backwater town, but you can't fool me. I listen to public radio.\nPlankton: And what's that supposed to mean?\nSquidward: It means you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.  It was you all along. But you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land, King Neptune!\nPlankton: We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips.\nKaren: Now activating helmet brain-control devices.\nSquidward: Huh? What?\nWearers of Helmets: All hail Plankton.\nSquidward: What's going on here?\nPlankton's Slaves : All hail Plankton.\nPlankton: Seize him, slaves!\nSlaves: All hail Plankton.\nSquidward: I'm getting outta here!\nSlaves: All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.\nPlankton: Who can stop me now?! Who?!\nSpongeBob: Come on, Pat, one more time.\nPatrick: Okay.  We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out.\nSpongeBob: Weed 'em out!\nPatrick: What a jerk.\nSpongeBob: Whoa! The road's getting kinda bumpy here.\nPatrick: You know, SpongeBob, there's a lesson to be learned from all of this.\nSpongeBob: What's that, Patrick?\nPatrick: A bubble-blowing double baby doesn't belong out here in man's country.\nSpongeBob: Yeah.  Wait. We blew that bubble. Doesn't that make us a bubble-blowing double baby?\nPatrick: Hey look! Free ice cream!\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy!\nPatrick: How you doing? Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\nPatrick: Make mine a chocolate!\nSpongeBob: Got you covered.  Two, please.\nOld Woman: Certainly. You kids enjoy.\nSpongeBob: Actually, we're men, lady, but thanks.  Hey, Patrick, let's...  You can let go now. I said, let go, please.  What is this? What kind of old lady are you?  Eww.\nPatrick: Did you get the ice cream?\nSpongeBob: Step on it, Patrick!\nDennis: Hmm...\nVictor: Hey!  You may not know it, cowboy, but we got a rule around here about blowing bubbles.\nAll Thugs: All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every...able-bodied...patron...\nOld Woman: Come on, kiddies, have some ice cream.  I'll let you pet Mr. Whiskers.\nMr. Whiskers: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Jump for it, Patrick!  Well, we lost our car again.\nPatrick: Never mind the car, where's the road?  Road, road, road,  road, road, road, road,  r... Sorry.\nSpongeBob: There's the road.  On the other side of this  deep, dark... dangerous...\nPatrick: Hazardous.\nSpongeBob: Hazardous...\nPatrick: Monster-infested.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, monster-infested...  trench.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look!  Here's the way down. Well, we're not gonna get the crown standing here. On to Shell City.  Hey, look, it's making noise. SpongeBob?  Hey, where are you going?\nSpongeBob: I'm going home, Patrick.\nPatrick: But what about Mr. Krabs?\nSpongeBob: What about us? We'll never survive in that trench. You said it yourself, this is man's country. And let's face it, Pat. We're just...kids.\nPatrick: We're not kids!\nSpongeBob: Open your eyes, Patrick! We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream. We worship a dancing peanut, for corn's sake! We don't belong out here!\nPatrick: We do not worship him!\nSpongeBob: You've been wearing the same Goofy Goober Peanut Party underpants for three years straight!  What do you call that!?\nPatrick: Worship?  You're right, SpongeBob. We are kids!\nSpongeBob: Pull your pants up, Patrick. We're going home.\nMindy: But you can't go home!\nSpongebob: Mindy!\nPatrick: Mindy?!\nSpongeBob: How much did you hear?\nMindy: I heard enough.\nPatrick: Did you see my underwear?\nMindy: No, Patrick.\nPatrick: Did you want to?\nMindy: Look, guys, you may be kids, but you're the only ones left who can get that crown.\nSpongeBob: What do you mean, the only ones left?\nMindy: Things have gotten a lot worse since you left Bikini Bottom.  Or should I say, Planktopolis.\nSlaves: All hail Plankton.\nPlankton: No resting! This monument celebrating my glory isn't gonna build itself. Move faster!\nSpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look! Plankton's turned everyone we know into slaves.  Squidward, Sandy, Mrs. Puff,  even Gary.\nGary: Meow Plankton.\nSpongeBob: Can't your father do something?\nMindy: My father's too distracted by his bald spot to do anything.\nNeptune: Squire, will you hurry?\nMindy: So you see, you can't quit. The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands.\nSpongeBob: But... But we're just...\nMindy: Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids. What's so wrong with being a kid, anyway? Kids rule! You don't need to be a man to do this. You just gotta believe in yourself. You just gotta believe!\nSpongeBob: I believe.\nMindy: That's the spirit!\nSpongeBob: I believe that...everybody I know is a goner!\nMindy: Come on, guys.  Guys...  Guys?  Ew!\nNarrator: Meanwhile.\nMindy: Guys?  Oh, boy. Think, Mindy, think.  Yup, I guess you're right.  A couple of kids could never survive this journey.  That's why I guess I'll just have to turn you into men.\nSpongeBob: You can do that? How?\nMindy: With my mermaid magic\nSpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? She'll use her mermaid magic to turn us into men!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!  We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men!\nMindy: Good. Now, let's get started. Close your eyes.\nSpongeBob: Are we men yet?\nMindy: Not yet. Uhhh... spin around three times.\nSpongeBob: I think it's working.\nMindy: Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.  With my mermaid magic and my one tailfin , I command the two of you to turn into men! Open your eyes.\nSpongeBob: I don't feel any...  Oh, my gosh, Patrick, you have a mustache!\nPatrick: So do you!\nSpongeBob: Wow.\nMindy: So now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?  Guys!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah?\nMindy: I said, now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Heck, yeah!\nMindy: Are men afraid of anything?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Heck, no!\nMindy: And why?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Because we're invincible!  Yeah!\nMindy: I never said that!\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\nPatrick: Yeah, buddy?\nSpongeBob: Why did we jump over the edge instead of taking the stairs?\nPatrick: Bec... well...\nSpongeBob: Patrick.\nPatrick: Huh. Are we dead?\nSpongeBob No, far from it, my friend. We're safe and sound at the bottom of this trench.\nPatrick: The mustaches worked!\nSpongeBob: Do you know what that means?  We are invincible!\nSpongeBob & Patrick: \u266aNow that we're men, we can do anything.\u266a  \u266aNow that we're men, we are invincible.\u266a  \u266aNow that we're men, we'll go to Shell City,\u266a \u266a get the crown, save the town, and Mr. Krabs.\u266a  \u266aNow that we're men,\u266a\nSpongeBob: \u266aWe have facial hair.\u266a\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aNow that we're men,\u266a\nPatrick: \u266aI change my underwear.\u266a\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aNow that we're men, we've got a manly flair.\u266a  \u266aWe've got the stuff.

Ha!\u266a\nSpongeBob: Yeah, go, Pat.\nPatrick: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\nSpongeBob: Oh yeah.\nPatrick: Yeah, go SpongeBob.  Ah!\nMonsters: Hooray! \u266aNow that they're men, We can't bother them. Now that they're men, they have become our friends. Now that they're men, there'll be a happy end. They'll pass the test and finish the quest for the crown. They'll pass the test\u266a  \u266aand finish the quest.\u266a  \u266aThey'll pass the test and finish the quest for the crown!\u266a\nSpongeBob: \"Shell City, dead ahead.\" We did it, Pat! We made it past everything! Even the hideous, disgusting monsters.\nMonsters: Huh? Aww.\nSpongeBob: Not you guys. You guys are awesome!  Well, Patrick, we should be there in one more verse.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: \u266aNow that we're men...\u266a\nDennis: Finally.  I got you right where I want you.\nSpongeBob: Can I help you with something, sir?\nDennis: Name's Dennis. I've been hired to exterminate you.\nSpongeBob: You're gonna exterminate us?  Listen, junior, you caught me and my friend here in a good mood today, so I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Step aside, and you won't have to feel the awesome wrath of our mustaches.\nDennis: You mean these?  I thought you still had a piece of salad stuck to your lip from lunchtime.\nSpongeBob: They were fake?\nDennis: Of course they were fake! This is what a real mustache looks like.\nPatrick: Is he a mermaid?\nDennis: All right. Enough gab.\nSpongeBob: What are you gonna do to us?\nDennis: Plankton was very specific.\nSpongeBob: Plankton?\nDennis: For some reason, he wanted me to step on you.\nPatrick: Step on us?\nDennis: Yeah! That way you'll never find out that he stole the crown!\nDennis: uhhh... Perhaps I've said too much.\nPatrick: That's a big boot!\nDennis: Don't worry. This'll only hurt a lot!  I love this job!\nPatrick: Bigger boot!\nSpongeBob: Wait, Pat. This bigger boot saved our lives.\nPatrick: Yay!\nBoth: Thank you, stranger.\nSpongeBob: Uhh... Stranger?\nSpongeBob: IT'S THE CYCLOPS!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Help us! Help us! Save us, someone!\nPatrick: Are we dead?\nSpongeBob: I don't think so.  Artificially colored rocks?\nSpongeBob: I don't know where we are. What is this?\nPatrick: It's some kind of wall of psychic energy.\nSpongeBob: No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl.\nSpongeBob: Hey, there's some fish folk.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, over here! Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys! You guys, hey! Help! Hey! Help! A little help here! We're stuck in this...\nSpongeBob: Wait a second. , and a mariachi band Those fish are...  dead.  What's he gonna do with us?

The heat is so intense from this lamp that I can't move.\nPatrick: Tell me about it.\nSpongeBob: This doesn't look too good, Patrick.\nPatrick: You mean we're not gonna \u266aget the crown, save the town and Mr. Krabs?\u266a\nSpongeBob: I don't even think we're gonna be able to save ourselves, buddy.\nSpongeBob: Thanks.\nPatrick: Don't mention it.\nSpongeBob: Well, it looks like what everybody said about us is true, Patrick.\nPatrick: You mean that we're attractive?\nSpongeBob: No, that we're just kids. A couple of kids in way over their heads. We were doomed from the start. I mean, look at us. We didn't even come close to the crown. We let everybody down. We failed.\nPatrick: Shell City.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we never made it to Shell City.\nPatrick: Shell City.\nSpongeBob: Exactly, buddy.

Dennis always gets his man.\nSpongeBob: Never!  Yeah! I did it!\nDennis: You got guts, kid.  Too bad I gotta rip them out of you.\nSpongeBob: I don't know what Plankton's paying you,  but if you let us go, I can make it worth your while.\nDennis: It's gonna take a lot more than five... What is this?\nSpongeBob: That, sir, is five Goober Dollars. Legal tender at any participating Goofy Goober-- ... I got bubbles. Fun at parties.\nDennis: My eyes!\nPatrick: I got you, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Thanks, buddy.  Uh, thanks a lot.\nDennis: That's it! I'm through messin' around! See ya later, fools!  Huh?  Ahhhhhhhh!\nPatrick: See ya.\nMindy: So you think... I'm...  stalling.\nNeptune: Gah! Where am I, in Crazytown? I have had enough of this nonsense!  You are to wait in the carriage until the execution is done!\nMindy: But, Daddy...\nNeptune: Now!\nMindy: No, no, no! Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are, you better hurry.\nDavid Hasselhoff: Okay, fellas, this is where you get off. Bikini Bottom's directly below.\nSpongeBob: But we'll never be able to float down in time.\nDavid Hasselhoff: Who said anything about floating?\nAnnouncer: Initiating launch sequence.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: What the?\nSpongeBob: Did you see that?\nPatrick: The control.\nDavid Hasselhoff: All hands on deck.\nAnnouncer: Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight...\nNeptune: Eugene Krabs, the time has come...\nMindy: No!\nPlankton: Yes!\nAnnouncer: ...six, five...\nNeptune: ... for you...\nMindy: No!\nPlankton: Yes!\nAnnouncer: ...three, two...\nNeptune: ...to fry.\nMindy: No-o-o!\nPlankton: Yes!\nAnnouncer: ... one.\nSpongebob & Patrick: Ahhhhhhh!\nMr. Krabs: No!\nDavid Hasselhoff: You done good, Hasselhoff. You done...  Ow.\nSpongeBob: Hooray! We made it!\nPatrick: We made it!\nNeptune: My crown! My beautiful crown!\nMindy: SpongeBob? Patrick? I knew you could do it!\nPlankton: Oh, yes. Well done, SpongeBoob.\nSpongeBob: Sorry to rain on your parade, Plankton.\nPlankton: Oh, don't worry about me. My parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella!\nSpongeBob, Mindy, and Patrick: Umbrellaaaaaaaa?\nMindy: Daddy, no!\nPlankton: Daddy, yes!\nNeptune: All hail Plankton.\nPeople: All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.\nPatrick: SpongeBob, what happened?\nSpongeBob: Plankton cheated.\nPlankton: Cheated?  Hold on there, baldy.  Oh, grow up. What, you think this is a game of kickball on the playground? You never had a chance to defeat me, fool! And you know why?\nSpongeBob: Because you cheated?\nPlankton: No, not because I cheated! Because I'm an evil genius. And you're just a kid. A stupid kid!\nSpongeBob: I guess you're right, Plankton. I am just a kid.\nPlankton: Of course I'm right. Okay, Neptune, time to kill.\nSpongeBob: And you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, twenty-seven-and-a-half seconds. And if I've learned anything during that time, It's that you are who you are.\nPlankton: That's right. Okay, Neptune...\nSpongeBob: And no amount of mermaid magic...  ...or managerial promotion...  ...or some other third thing... can make me anything more than what I really am inside: A kid.\nPlankton: That's great. Now, get back against the wall.\nSpongeBob: But that's okay.\nPlankton: What? What's going on?\nSpongeBob: Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do. I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back.\nPlankton: All right, we get the point.\nSpongeBob: So, yeah, I'm a kid.  And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut. And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!\nPlankton: What's going on here?\nSpongeBob: But most of all, I'm...\nPlankton: Okay, settle down. Take it easy.\nSpongeBob: I'm... I'm...\nPlankton: What the scallop?!\nSpongeBob: \u266aI'm a Goofy Goober! Rock!\u266a  \u266aYou're a Goofy Goober! Rock! We're all Goofy Goobers! Rock! Goofy, goofy, goober, goober! Put your toys away. Well, all I gotta say when you tell me not to play, I say no way. No way! No, no freaking way! I'm a kid, you say, when you say I'm a kid I say, Say it again and then I say thanks. Thanks! Thank you very much! So if you're thinking that you'd like to be like me, go ahead and try. The kid inside will set you free! I'm a Goofy Goober! Rock!\u266a\nPlankton: What's happening?  His dance moves are impressive, but I'm in control.  Seize him!\nPeople: All hail Plankton.\nPatrick: Whoo!\nFish: I'm free. I've been freed!\nPlankton: What?  No!  My precious helmets!\nSquidward: Ha!\nMrs. Puff: Hoo!\nSandy: Yee-haw!\nGary: Meow.\nPlankton: His chops are too righteous! The helmets can't handle this level of rock 'n' roll! Karen, do something! Karen?  All right, that's the last straw! Neptune, I command you to...\nMindy: Here you go, Daddy.\nPlankton: I better get outta here.\nSandals: Look, it's the wizard who saved us.\nPlankton: Out of my way, fools.  Ow! Ow! Oooooooow!\nPlankton: Come on, I was just kidding. Come on, you guys knew that, didn't you? With the helmets and the big monuments...Wasn't that hilarious, everybody?  I will destroy all of you!\nNeptune: Well, Mindy, I have to admit, you were right. Your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait. Without it, I would have never again seen my beloved crown. I think you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day. Now, let's go home.\nMindy: Daddy, haven't you forgotten something?\nNeptune: What? Oh, yeah. Eugene Krabs, I forgot to unfreeze you.\nMr. Krabs: What the...?\nNeptune: I guess I had it set to \"real boy\" ending.\nMr. Krabs: Yippee!\nNeptune: Oh, I'm sorry for falsely freezing you, Krabs. And may I say, sir, you are a very lucky fellow to have in your employment such a brave, faithful, and heroic young lad. Where is he, anyway?\nSpongeBob: I'm up here.\nPatrick: I'm on it.\nNeptune: Go to him now, Krabs. Embrace him.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, I'm sorry I ever doubted ye. That's a mistake I won't make again.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, you old soft-serve.\nMr. Krabs: And now, SpongeBob, I'm gonna do something that I should've done six days ago. Mr. Squidward! Front and center, please.  I think we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager button.\nSquidward: I couldn't agree more, sir.\nHarold: Hooray for SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Wait a second, everybody. There's something I need to say first. I just don't know how to put it.\nSquidward: I think I know what it is. After going on your life-changing journey, you now realize you don't want what you thought you wanted. What you really wanted was inside you all along.\nSpongeBob: Are you crazy?  I was just gonna say that your fly is down!  Manager! This is the greatest day of my life!\nCaptain: You know. David Hasselhoff is a great artist.\nUsher: Excuse me, sir. You folks have to leave.\nCaptain: What? Say that again, if you dare.\nUsher: You folks have to leave.\nCaptain: Okay.\n","2\nThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water\nBurger Beard: Aha!  \"Booby Traps\"?!  Oh. There you are, my lovely.  What's that? Take the book? I don't mind if I do.  At last, it is mine. Finally, you are mine.  All right. Let's do this. Bare Knuckles.  Bring it on, skinny. You don't scare me.\nSeagull #1: You got any sevens?\nSeagull #2: Go fish.\nBurger Beard: Is that all you got?!  Man, this is way overdue.  Once upon a time, under the sea, there was a little town called,  \"Bikini Bottom.\"  In this town, there was a place called,  \"The Krusty Krab,\" where folks would come to eat a thing called,  \"the Krabby Patty.\" Every  greasy spoon has a  fry cook, and the one  who worked here  was named,  \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\"\nSeagull Crew: Oh...  ...who lives in a pineapple under  the sea?  SpongeBob  SquarePants! Absorbent  and yellow--\nBurger Beard: Hold it. Just hold it.\nSeagull Crew: SpongeBob SquarePants!  If nautical nonsense be something  you wish. SpongeBob SquarePants!  Then drop on the deck and  flop like a fish.  Sponge...  ...Bob Square...  ...Pants!  SpongeBob Square...\nBurger Beard: Stop!  There's only one thing worse than talking birds, and that would be... Singing Birds!\nSeagull: Okay, I promise not to... \u266a sing! \u266a\nSkeleton Parrot #1: Take it from us.\nSkeleton Parrot #2: He really does hate singing birds.\nKyle: Just keep weading. Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.\nBurger Beard: Come closer. Let me tell you the tale.\nDavid: Okay, start reading.\nBurger Beard: Not that close!  All right. Here we go.  Now, SpongeBob loved his job as a fry cook more than anything.  And that is saying a lot. Because he loved everything!  He loved his pet snail, Gary.  He loved his best friend, Patrick.   He loved blowing bubbles...  ...and jellyfishing.\nSpongeBob: Whee!\nBurger Beard: He loved making Krabby Patties for the folks in Bikini Bottom.. ...just as much as they loved eating them.  \"Why,\" you may ask, \"do they love this greasy meal sandwich so much? Why did they eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...  \"...despite the doctor's warnings?\"\nDr. Gill Gilliam: He'll be gone in a week.\nShubie: Oh, Harold!\nBurger Beard: Ah, it was a secret.  No one was sure what was in those patties that made them so delicious. And frankly, no one cared, except for Plankton.\nPlankton: Meh.\nBurger Beard: Plankton owned a restaurant right across the street from the Krusty Krab, where no one ate...  ...because the food was really bad!\nPlankton: Now, is that really necessary?!\nBurger Beard: Plankton had made it his life's work to steal the recipe.\nPlankton: SpongeBob, please! Let's talk about this. '\nBurger Beard: But SpongeBob was always there to protect it. But today...  ...things would be different.\nPatrick: Good morning, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Morning, Patrick! Are you here for your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?\nPatrick: I'm getting two today. One for me, and one for my friend.\nSpongeBob: Oh, have I met this friend?\nPatrick: You know me, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.\nMr. Krabs: 13, 14, 15...\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.\nMr. Krabs: Tartar...  ...sauce?\nPlankton: Bullseye!\nSpongeBob: Plankton!\nMr. Krabs: So it's a food fight he wants, eh?\nPlankton: Welcome to Air Plankton! Please put your seat backs and tray tables up as we're now approaching our final destination.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. Load the potatoes!\nPatrick: Mashed or scalloped, sir?\nSpongeBob: No, Patrick. Raw.\nPatrick: Sir, yes, sir!  Locked and loading!\nMr. Krabs: Don't worry, little formula. You'll be safe in this...safe.  Fire!\nPlankton: Potatoes?!\nSpongeBob: He's closing in!\nPatrick: I think we have a few minutes before he gets here.  Huh?  He's right on top of us!\nSandals: Hey, it's raining fries!\nPlankton: It's gonna take a lot more than potatoes to bring this baby down!  Or maybe not.\nPatrick: Whoo!\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute, Patrick. Look! He's got a tank!\nPlankton: Well, Krabs, you're certainly in a pickle now!\nSandals: Hey, it's raining pickles!  Now, it's raining...  ...tanks.\nPlankton: You're welcome.\nPatrick: Finland.\nSpongeBob: Your order, sir.\nSandy: I'll have two Krabby Patties: extra ketchup, extra mustard, and hold the mayo.\nSpongeBob: Wrong channel!  Your order, sir!\nMr. Krabs: Extra ketchup, extra mustard, hold the mayo!\nSpongeBob: Yes, sir!  Extra ketchup, extra mustard.\nPatrick: Hold the mayo!\nMr. Krabs: Unleash the condiments.\nSpongeBob: With relish.  Excuse me!\nSandy: Hello? Hello?!  Guess ya'll don't want my money.\nMr. Krabs: Money?!  Thank you. Come again.\nPatrick: I can't hold the mayo any longer!\nPlankton: Mayo?! Well, it's gonna take a lot more than mayo to stop-\nSpongeBob: Now what?\nPatrick: Uhh... I just remembered! I don't work for Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Robot! Robot! Robot! Giant robot! Robot! Robot!  Mr. Krabs! Plankton's here, and he's got a giant robot!\nMr. Krabs: Quick, boy! Bar the door!\nSpongeBob: Got it!\nPlankton: I'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Oh, barnacles! I'm out of gas?!  Well, I'm not through yet. I've got something that will make you hand over that formula: something you can't resist.\nMr. Krabs: Money?!\nPlankton: Yes.  That's...that's...that's impossible!  Well, it was full of money just last week. Then I bought that airplane, and built that tank-\nMr. Krabs: Sounds to me like someone's just a wee bit...broke!\nPlankton: Well, Krabs, I guess you've won. I've spent every penny I've ever made trying to put you out of business...  ...except this one: my last penny.  Besides, what could I do with one measly cent, anyway?\nMr. Krabs: You could give it to me.  Just a suggestion.\nPlankton: Here.  Take it!  You've taken everything else. Why not?!\nMr. Krabs: Well, Plankton, like a reheated Krabby Patty, you've been foiled again!\nSpongeBob: I guess this means that the secret formula is safe forever. Right, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: It sure does, boy.  Why don't you scurry along?  Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!  He's been out there crying for twenty minutes.  Pathetic.  I'm just gonna go out there and gloat a little.\nPlankton: Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.\nKaren: Laptop.  You do realize that nickname is demeaning. I have twice the processing power of  a laptop.\nPlankton: Never mind. Maintain radio silence.  He-he, finally!  A pressure plate, eh, Krabs? Amateur hour.  Hmm...  Perfect.  Not a bad likeness.  Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs. Easy, easy.\nMr. Krabs: Plankton's broke! Ooh-ooh! Plankton's broke! Ha-ha!\nSpongeBob: Look at Mr. Krabs go! I've never seen him gloat this hard before.\nMr. Krabs: Well, Plankton, me bunions are telling me it's time to stop gloatin'.  Eh? Looks like you're falling apart at the seams.  Huh?\nPlankton Robot: Poor me.  Sob, sob.\nMr. Krabs: A robot?!\nSpongeBob: Plankton?!\nPlankton: Uh-oh.  That ain't good.\nComputer Voice: Initiating Lockdown Sequence.\nMr. Krabs: Me formuler!\nSquidward: Huh?  Ow!\nMr. Krabs: No, no, no! No, no, no!  No!  Squidward! Open up! Squidward!\nPlankton Robot: Ha, ha! Victory dance! Booya!\nSpongeBob: Give me that!\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob!  Join me, and we'll be rich and powerful! ...  ...until I eventually betray you!  Uuh... Join me!\nSpongeBob: No! Never! I'm on team Krabs for life!\nMr. Krabs: Plankton!\nSpongeBob: What? Where'd it go?\nPlankton: Wait a minute... Molecular deconstruction? I proved that to be a scientific impossibility 7 times!\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute... I think I forgot to empty Gary's litter box today.\nMr. Krabs: Where's me formuler, Plankton?!\nPlankton: I-I don't know! It just disappeared!\nMr. Krabs: Why should I believe you, ya lyin' liar?!\nSpongeBob: Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs, but this time, he's telling the truth! It just vanished!\nPlankton: It's true!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you! He's innocent!\nPlankton: W-What are you gonna do, Krabs?! Pour hot oil on me?! Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?!\nMr. Krabs: No. Knock-Knock.\nPlankton: Knock-Knock jokes? I can do this all day, Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Knock-Knock.\nPlankton: Oh, boy. Who's there?\nMr. Krabs: Jimmy.\nPlankton: Jimmy who?\nMr. Krabs: Jimmy back me formuler, Plankton!\nPlankton: Well, that's stupid, but how is it torture?\nMr. Krabs: Hehehehe... You'll see.\nSpongeBob: Jimmy... Back my formula? Hmm. Ohhhhhhhhh! I get it!\nPlankton: Oh, make it stop, Krabs! Make it stop!\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs!  SpongeBob, zip it!\nPlankton: Oh, thank you, Squidward!\nSquidward: The customers are getting restless. They're asking for...  refunds.\nMr. Krabs: Refunds?!  Listen up boy!  Get in there and make me customers some Krabby Patties! All right, Plankton...  SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?  We're out of Krabby Patties?!\nSpongeBob: How can we make more Krabby Patties without the secret formula?!\nMr. Krabs: You've got to have that formuler memorized by now!\nSpongeBob: But as you are aware sir,  the employee handbook clearly states and I quote,  \"No employee may, in part or in whole, commit the Krabby Patty Secret Formula to any recorded, written, or visual form, including memories, dreams, and/or needle point.\"\nMr. Krabs: Curse you, fine print!\nMr. Krabs: Stop!  I'm not your enemy!  Plankton is your enemy!\nSquidward: So is he an anemone or Plankton?\nMrs. Puff: Well, someone had to do it.\nSpongeBob: But...but, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: He took this from you.\nFred: A Krabby Patty.\nSandals: I can almost taste it.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take the secret formula.\nMr. Krabs: Not now, SpongeBob!\nPatrick: Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty.\nMr. Krabs: So, join me. Help get the formuler back, and I'll give each and every one of ya a free Krabby Patty!  Oh, no, wait! Even better: a slight discount.  To the Chum Bucket!\nSpongeBob: But he didn't do it.\nPlankton: I had it right in my greedy little mits, and then: poof! And now it's gone. Gone forever! Oh, I was so close to gaining the people's respect/fear.\nKaren: Um, Plankton?\nPlankton: Oh, when will my frustration/humiliation end?\nKaren: Plankton...\nPlankton: Not now, Hun! I'm ranting/raving.  All right, what is it?\nKaren: Well, I was trying to tell you there's an angry mob outside,  but now they're inside.\nPlankton: Oh...\nKaren: I...just work here.\nMr. Krabs: We'd like to have a word with you.\nPlankton: You all look very hungry. Can I get anybody a Chumburger?\nMr. Krabs: Enough with that niceties, Plankton! This is the last time I'm gonna ask you. Where is me formuler?!\nPlankton: I told you, Krabs! I don't have it!\nMr. Krabs: Wrong answer!\nSpongeBob: Stop! All right, Mr. Krabs. Let me get in on this.\nPlankton: What's going on around here?\nSpongeBob: You may want to step back a little, Mr. Krabs. This could get messy.\nMr. Krabs: Let's hope so.\nSpongeBob: So, you won't talk, eh, Plankton?  I didn't wanna have to do this. Plankton,...  ...here comes the pain!\nMr. Krabs: Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical.\nPlankton: No, stop, don't!\nMr. Krabs: Wait, that didn't look painful.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you may not understand what I'm about to do today.  But someday, we'll look back and have a good laugh.\nMr. Krabs: Wait a minute.\nCustomer: Hey, they're getting away!\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: So, you've been runnin' a long con on me, eh? All these years, you've been working for Plankton?!\nPaco: They're in cahoots!\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, I guess that's a short way of saying it. Stop that bubble!\nCustomer: Please tell me there's something soft below me.\nSpongeBob and Plankton: Uh, nope.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob!  Oh, you were like an underpaid son to me. I would have expected Squidward to stab me in the back!\nSquidward: Huh, what?\nMr. Krabs: But SpongeBob, me most trusted employee, working with me sworn enemy?!  You know what this means, Mr. Squidward?\nSquidward: We get the rest of the day off?\nMr. Krabs: No! This be but a harbinger of what I fear lies ahead. For you, for me, for all of Bikini Bottom! The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together! Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order! A war of all against all! Dark times are ahead! Dark times indeed!\nSquidward: Seriously?  Aren't you overreacting a bit?\nMr. Krabs: Welcome to the apocalypse, Mr. Squidward.  I hope you like leather.\nSquidward: I prefer suede.\nBurger Beard: And so, Bikini Bottom became an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore. The end!\nKyle: Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending!\nDavid: Oh, this is bad. Really bad! SpongeBob's in trouble, and the story's over?!\nAndy: Ouch, Ouch, Ouch!\nHenry: There is no way that that's the end of the story.\nBurger Beard: Oh, of course it is. I'll show you. Just turn around.\nHenry: Oh, all right.  Hey, I need that to fly, you jerk!\nBurger Beard: The end!\nHenry: That's not the end.\nAndy: You'd better keep reading, Mr. Pirate,...  ...or else!\nHenry: I know I shouldn't be littering, but that ending was rubbish!\nPatrick: Good morning, Squidward. I'll have the usual.  With cheese.\nSquidward: We're out of Krabby Patties right now!\nPatrick: No...Krabby Patties?!  No!\nSpongeBob: Look what's become of Bikini Bottom. We've really gotta get that formula back.\nPlankton: Hmm... Get the secret formula, you say? Excuse me, I...need a moment. With that formula, I could rule the world!\nSpongeBob: You know I can hear you, right?\nPlankton: Well, what do we do now?\nSpongeBob: Now we work together. You know, teamwork.\nPlankton: What's a te-amwork?\nSpongeBob: No, Plankton, teamwork.\nPlankton: Te-amwork.\nSpongeBob: Teamwork.\nPlankton: Tie 'em work.\nSpongeBob: Teamwork.\nPlankton: Tie 'em up.\nSpongeBob: Say \"team\" like a sports...\nPlankton: Team.\nSpongeBob: Team. Now say \"work.\"\nPlankton: Work.\nSpongeBob: Put 'em together, what do you got?\nPlankton: Time bomb... work.\nSpongeBob: Gettin' better.\nJohnny: Now, Bikini Bottom action news!\nSandy: Oh! Hey, Patrick!\nPatrick: Come on, tummy. It's gonna be a long day.\nJohnny: We interrupt your regular program for an important news bulletin!\nPerch Perkins: Perch Perkins reporting live from Downtown Bikini...  ...Bottom. Complete chaos here today as our town attempts to deal with a sudden and complete shortage of Krabby Patties.  Whoa! Events here have this reporter wondering, what is the secret ingredient in Krabby Patties, anyway?!\nFish: It's love! The secret ingredient is love!\nSandy: No more Krabby Patties?! If I'd known that, I'd have chewed it slower. Huh?  What the corndog is that?!\nSpongeBob: Come on, Plankton, it's easy, It means I help you, you help me, and when we accomplish our goal, then we do hands in the middle.\nPlankton: Hands in the middle? No, no, sounds idiotic. Besides, the two of us are no match for that cranky mob.  We could probably use a few more... te-am-works.\nSpongeBob: That's exactly what I was thinking.\nPlankton: Wait, what are you doing?\nPatrick: I...need...Krabby Patties!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\nPatrick: I...need...Krabby Patties!  Vandalizing stuff.\nPlankton: Isn't that your house?\nPatrick: Hey, what's with all the questions?! Who are you guys?!\nSpongeBob: It's me, your best friend, SpongeBob.\nPatrick: Oh, yeah. Well, if you're SpongeBob, then what's the secret password?\nSpongeBob and Plankton: Uhh...\nPatrick: Correct! It is you! SpongeBob!  SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Patrick!\nPatrick: SpongeBob! Why aren't you at the Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties?\nSpongeBob: Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.\nPatrick: Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.\nSpongeBob: No, that's not what happened. It just disappeared. We're putting a team together to find it.\nPatrick: A team? Oh, oh, pick me, pick me, pick me!\nSpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, you're in.\nPlankton: I don't know, SpongeBob.  What exactly does this clown bring to the te-am?\nSpongeBob: He brings loyalty, Plankton, loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?\nPatrick: Yeah, yeah, loyalty. I've got SpongeBob! He's over here!\nMr. Krabs: Let's go get him!\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob. Let's get out of here!\nSpongeBob: Patrick-  Patrick, why are you doing this?!\nPatrick: Because I need Krabby Patties! Hurry up! I'm hungry! Over here!  Guys? Am I still on the team?  Hey, what are you looking at?\nSpongeBob: Sandy!  Sandy?  Sandy. Sandy, are you home? Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is. What is all this stuff?  Sandy?\nSandy: Don't touch that!  Incoherent muttering...\nSpongeBob: Sandy, are you okay?\nSandy: Okay?!  Have you looked outside?! Does that seem okay to you?! I'm trying to figure out what happened to society. If we don't fix it soon, there won't be anything left to fix!\nSpongeBob: Sandy! The lack of Krabby Patties has driven her mad.\nSandy: And I think I figured it out. Look!  When this came down from above, I knew it could only mean one thing.\nSpongeBob: And that would be?\nSandy: It means it's the end! The sandwich gods are angry with us!\nSpongeBob and Plankton: Sandwich gods?\nSandy: I just don't know how we're going to appease them!\nPlankton: You got any other friends who aren't dim bulbs or nut jobs?\nSpongeBob: Well, I have one friend who's loyal to the very end.  Gary, I'm home.  Gare bear?  Gary? Gary?  Huh?\nPlankton: Revolting!\nSpongeBob: But it means Gary is close by. Gary, I'm back! Whoa.  Oh, hey, Gary. Plankton and I need you to help us find the Krabby Patty formula and fix Bikini Bottom.\nSpongeBob: What do you mean you don't have to do as I say anymore?!\nSpongeBob: What do you mean king of snails?! Gary the Snail, you get down here right now and join this team!\nSpongeBob: What do you mean seize them?!\nPlankton: Why are you running?\nSpongeBob: Because they're right on our tail.  Oh, right, snails.\nPlankton: Well, so much for your te-am.\nSpongeBob: Putting together a team is a lot harder than I thought it would be.\nMr. Krabs: This way!\nPlankton: We better get out of here until things cool off.\nSpongeBob: Everything we know and love has been destroyed.\nPlankton: Well, yeah, looks like they're gonna have to change the name of Bikini Bottom to Dirty Bottom  right SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: That's kinda gross, Plankton.\nPlankton: Yeah, yeah, too soon, huh?\nSpongeBob: This feels like it really is the end.\nPlankton: Don't worry, SpongeBob. We'll find the secret formula and everything will go back to the way it was. You know, all happy and junk.  Now let's try and get some sleep.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, I guess you're right.\nPlankton: There you are, feel comfy?\nSpongeBob: You know, Plankton? I think you might know a little bit more about teamwork than you lead on.\nPlankton: Good night, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Good night, Plankton.\nPlankton: Good night, indeed.  That's right SpongeBob, sleep. You're hiding that formula in there somewhere.  Huh?  Well, here goes nothing.  Huh? What... is this place?\nIce Cream Boy: Fudge fight!  It's all over me.\nPlankton: Ew! It's so sweet in here. I think my eyeball is getting a toothache.\nPopsicle Twins: Hello, Plankton. Come and play with us  Hurry.  Before we melt.\nGiant Fluffy Cat: Meow.\nPlankton: So much sweetness! I think I'm gonna be sick.  Huh?\nRainbow: Daddy!\nSpongeBob: Plankton? Oh, Plankton, I just had the craziest dream, and you were in it.\nPlankton: I'm sure it was nothing.  Now, go back to sleep.\nSpongeBob: Were you in my brain?\nPlankton: What? No! That's crazy talk!\nSpongeBob: Then why is there cotton candy on your antennae?\nPlankton: Because uh... because uh... okay, fine, I was in your brain.\nSpongeBob: What were you doing in there?\nPlankton: What do you think I was doing? Looking for the secret formula.\nSpongeBob: What?\nPlankton: Don't act so innocent! You know what I was up to. That's why you're pretending not to know the formula.\nSpongeBob: I'm not pretending. I can't believe you thought I was lying.\nPlankton: Hey, don't take it personally, I just assume everyone is lying.\nSpongeBob: That is a horrible way to live your life.\nPlankton: Whatever.\nSpongeBob: It is. And if we're gonna be on the same team--\nPlankton: Maybe I don't wanna be on a te-am! You think of that?!\nSpongeBob: But, Plankton, everything's better when you're part of a team.\nPlankton: You're not gonna start singing, are you?  Oh, brother.\nPlankton: All right, you can put me down  Well,  that's one minute of my life I'll never get back.\nSpongeBob: Not without a time machine.\nPlankton: Wait a minute, hold that thought.  Now back up.\nSpongeBob: Enihcam emit a tuohtiw ton.\nPlankton: Slow down.\nSpongeBob: Not without a time machine.\nPlankton: Hmm. Yes.  SpongeBob, you're a genius!\nSpongeBob: I am?\nPlankton: If we build a time machine, we can go back to before the formula disappeared. Before society broke down. Before we became the hunted.\nSpongeBob: That sounds great, Plankton, but how do we build a time machine?\nPlankton: Well, first we'll need a computer powerful enough to calculate the intricacies of time travel.\nSpongeBob: Where would we get one of those?\nPlankton: Hmm.  There she is, my computer wife. They've got her tied up in the back room. I've never seen this many people at The Chum Bucket.\nSpongeBob: I've never seen anyone there.\nPlankton: Now was that really necessary?\nSpongeBob: 'Cause the food's really bad.\nPlankton: Oh, come on, really?\nSpongeBob: Shh!  How are we gonna sneak past those guards?\nPlankton: Hmm.\nFish: Well, what do we have here?\nSpongeBob: We better hurry. Those guys really hate tires.\nPlankton: We'll never get in, the door's locked.\nSpongeBob: Hmm. Wait. The window is open. Come on, Plankton, it's time for some teamwork. Give me a boost.\nPlankton: Okay. Wait a minute. No!\nPlankton: Ya there?\nSpongeBob: Just a little higher, Plankton. Plankton?\nPlankton: Why don't you boost me up instead?\nSpongeBob: Oh, yeah, good thinking.\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob, come on.\nSpongeBob: We're in.\nPlankton: There's a guard over there, camera pans to show Patrick sleeping on a chair Let's get take key from around his neck. We're gonna have to be very quiet. Let's walk on the tips of our toes.  Will you stop playing that tiny piano?!  You're gonna get us caught.\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\nPlankton: Now just reach over and grab it.\nPatrick: What? Huh? Who goes there?\nPlankton: Stop! Pull it over his head!\nSpongeBob: Oh.\nPlankton: Stop. Stop. Stop!  Let me get up there.  Help me.\nPatrick: What? Huh?!\nSpongeBob: No! Plankton, help!  I'll rock him, you tell him a bedtime story.\nPlankton: Uh, uh. Once upon a time, there was a big, fat, pink idiot who went to sleep. The end!\nPatrick: Nice try, but it's gonna take more than that to--\nKaren: I told you, I don't have the formula, you monsters!\nPlankton: Hey, baby, how are you?\nKaren: Plankton! My hero! You must need something, otherwise you wouldn't have come back.\nSpongeBob: Plankton has a plan to save Bikini Bottom.\nKaren: Doesn't matter, Plankton. Krabs knows all your plans. He's been through my hard drive looking for the secret formula.\nPlankton: Eh, I never had it, but we're going to get it. We're gonna go back in time and steal the formula before it disappeared.\nKaren: Time travel. Where are you gonna find a computer that can do that? Wait a minute.\nSpongeBob: I've never carried a head before.\nPlankton: You'll get used to it.\nSpongeBob: It's still warm.\nFish: So you won't talk, huh? Let some air out of it.\nSpongeBob: Is this where we're gonna build our time machine?\nPlankton: Sure. It's got everything we need. A photo booth, a cuckoo clock,  some day old chips. Now all we have to do is build it.  Oh, no, you don't.\nSpongeBob: Hey, my pitch pipe.\nPlankton: Uh, I need it for the time machine.\nSpongeBob: Oh, okay.\nPlankton: Installed!  I did it!\nSpongeBob: No. We did it.\nPlankton: Wait. We did do it. As a te-am.\nSpongeBob: A team.\nPlankton: Whatever.\nSpongeBob: Okay, now for the brains.\nKaren: Okay, Plankton, this is it. It's gonna take all my processors and energy to power this time machine. So, if you have anything you wanna tell me, you better tell me now.\nPlankton: Well, Karen. I know I've taken you for granted all these years and I... I just wanted to say... I'm glad you're on my te-am.\nKaren: Oh, Sheldon. That's the sweetest thing you've ever s--\nSpongeBob: Plankton, are you crying?\nPlankton: No, no, no, it's just one of the hazards of having a giant eyeball.  There's always stuff getting in there. Anyway,  where were we?  Say \"cheese.\"\nSpongeBob: Cheese!\nPlankton: According to my calculations, the Krusty Krab should be right here.\nSpongeBob: What's that over there?\nFuture Patrick: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Patrick?\nFuture Patrick: Is it really you?\nSpongeBob: Yes, Patrick. It's--\nFuture Patrick: Finally! The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!\nSpongeBob: Great Krabby Patty Famine? Oh, what year is this?\nFuture Patrick: It's Thursday.\nPlankton: According to my calculations, we've only gone 4 days into the future.\nSpongeBob: Where is everybody?\nFuture Patrick: They all gave up on you! But not me!  'Cause I'm not very smart.\nSpongeBob: Where is the Krusty Krab?\nFuture Patrick: Right where it's always been.\nSpongeBob: I think we may be lost in time, Plankton. Maybe we should ask this guy for directions. Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us when we are?\nBubbles: Who dares disturb the one who watches?\nSpongeBob: The one who watches? Your name is \"The one who watches\"?\nBubbles: No! My true name is \"Bubbles.\"\nPlankton: \"Bubbles\"?  Wha-what kind of a name is \"Bubbles\"?\nBubbles: It is my ancient dolphin name.\nSpongeBob: So what's a dolphin doing out here in the middle of space?\nBubbles: My kind have been watching and protecting the galaxy for--  Hmm. 10,000 years.\nSpongeBob: Oh, so you're the one keeping the meteors from hitting us.\nBubbles: Yes, I am. And I could really do with a potty break, would you mind keeping an eye on things?\nSpongeBob: Sure thing but uh, what am I keeping my eye on?\nPlankton: What are you doing?\nSpongeBob: I'm watching.\nPlankton: We don't even know what we're even watching for.\nSpongeBob: Maybe we should split up the work load.  You watch the one with the big red eye,  and I'll watch the one with the ringy thingies, like a team.\nPlankton: Okay, mine's moving.\nSpongeBob: Mine, too.\nPlankton: No, this doesn't seem right. Should we call Bubbles?\nSpongeBob: Let's give him a minute. He's been holding it for 10,000 years.  I'm pretty sure that wasn't supposed to happen!  Come on, Plankton we gotta clean this up before Bubbles gets back!\nBubbles: Much better, yes. You two are free to go.  What happened to Saturn and to Jupiter?!  You were supposed to--  keep them from smashing into each other!\nSpongeBob: Sorry.\nBubbles: Now--  I am going to lose my job! And you... will lose your lives.\nSpongeBob: Hey, quarter me!\nPast SpongeBob: Plankton?!\nPast Plankton: SpongeBob!?\nPast SpongeBob: Plankton?!\nPast Plankton: SpongeBob?! Who are you two supposed to be?\nPlankton: I'm you from the future.\nSpongeBob: And I'm him from the future!\nPast Plankton: So you traveled back through time to help me? Great thinking!\nSpongeBob: Nope. He's helping me.\nPast SpongeBob: But he's the enemy.\nSpongeBob: Was the enemy. Now we're a team.\nPast Plankton: What, a te-am?\nPlankton: A team! All right, go get the formula.\nPast SpongeBob: What have I become?\nSpongeBob: All right, Plankton.\nPast SpongeBob: Do you have flying boat mobiles in the future?\nPlankton: We only came back from the day after tomorrow, dim wit.\nPast SpongeBob: Are there rocket packs?\nPast SpongeBob: Did they outlaw clothes in the future?\nPlankton: No!\nPast SpongeBob: Then why are you naked?\nPlankton: 'Cause they don't make clothes in my size.\nSpongeBob: Hold still you!\nPast SpongeBob: If you're from the future, what am I gonna say next?\nPlankton: Something moronic?\nPast SpongeBob: Wow!\nPlankton: Hey, hurry up over there!\nPast Plankton: Uh oh, that ain't good.\nComputer Voice: Initiating Lockdown Sequence.\nPlankton: Come on, SpongeBob. We gotta get outta here.\nSpongeBob: Got it!\nPlankton: Come on!\nSpongeBob: Oh, that was crazy.\nPlankton: So that's what teamwork is. All those years, I tried to make you mine and I finally did it. I mean, we did it!\nBurger Beard: And so, it would seem that our heroes have accomplished all they had set out to do.\nAndy: Now that's an ending.\nSeagull: Woohoo!\nKyle: Andy, cue the music.\nAndy: \u266a Ooooh... \u266a\nBurger Beard: Oh, no. That's not the end.\nKyle: So, you mean the ending might be even happier?\nBurger Beard: Land ho!\nBurger Beard: Yeah! All right, you feathered rats, time to shove off!\nAndy: What? Why?\nBurger Beard: Well, I can't have you pooping all over my restaurant, can I?\nAndy: Restaurant? I thought this was a pirate ship.\nBurger Beard: Oh, it is. But it is also:...  A-ha! My very own food truck.\nSeagull #1: A what?\nBurger Beard: Uh, you know, a restaurant on wheels.\nSeagull #2: Like a garbage truck?\nAndy: Hmm.\nBurger Beard: No! Are you trying to scare away my customers?!\nSeagull #3: Well, we're not leaving until we see how the story ends.\nBurger Beard: No problem. You guys like a little snack while you wait?\nSeagull #3: Sure I'll take a curdled milk.\nAndy: How 'bout a fish head?\nSeagull #3: And a french fry covered in sand.\nBurger Beard: Who wants some hot wings?\nAndy: Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?!\nBurger Beard: Which one of you is next?\nSeagull: You're crazy, man! You're crazy!\nKyle: Bye-bye, Mr. Poop. Now I can get my golden sticker.  Oh, hey, Mr. Piwate. I wouldn't go in there if I were you.\nBurger Beard: Boo!\nKyle: I can't fly without my feathers.\nCab driver: Where to, Mac?\nKyle: Just dwive.\nPatrick: Uhh... Squidward?\nSquidward: Still out of Krabby Patties.\nPatrick: Does anyone have a picture of ketchup?\nSandy: I done figured it out!  We have angered the sandwich gods and only a sacrifice will appease them!\nBig Fish: Oh, that sounds reasonable.\nSandy: Soon, our post-apoca-whatchamacallit will be over and Krabby Patties will rain down from above!\nMr. Krabs: Rain down? Well that's no good! How will I get me money?!\nNat: Oh, you don't like that idea?  Then we'll sacrifice you!\nSpongeBob: It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice on an empty stomach.  Who wants a Krabby Patty?\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, is that me formuler?  Oh, happy day.  I've missed you so much. Where was it? Where'd you find it?\nSpongeBob: Well, Plankton and I built a time machine out of an old photo booth and then we added--\nPatrick: Cheese!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, wait!\nMr. Krabs: It's okay, everyone. The post-apocalypse is almost over!  Ain't that right SpongeBob?  \"Eugene, Eat My sSub-aquatic Air Bubbles! Love, Plankton?! \"\nPlankton: You grabbed the wrong bottle!\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: That's okay, SpongeBob. We'll just have to sacrifice the two of you then! Prepare them for the sacrifice!\nPatrick: I bring a message from the dawn of time!\nSpongeBob: What is it, Patrick?\nPatrick: Run!\nSquidward: Squidasaurus Rex!\nSpongeBob: Well, Plankton, I guess we failed to accomplish our goals.\nPlankton: We?\nSpongeBob: But, even failure hurts a little less when you do it as a team, right?\nPlankton: This is all your fault!\nSpongeBob: My fault?!\nPlankton: You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula!\nSpongeBob: I didn't know there were two bottles.\nPlankton: Of course you didn't! 'Cause you got cotton candy for brains!  No, seriously, he really does.\nSpongeBob: Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess in the first place if you weren't so selfish and evil!\nPlankton: I was selfish and evil until you ruined everything with your teamwork!\nSpongeBob: You take that back!\nPlankton: You are the worst teammate ever!\nSpongeBob: No!\nCustomer: Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing garbage and recycling!\nSpongeBob: Look at me. Why, I've become like all of you. Savage. Fear-ridden. Selfish. An entire town of formerly good citizens, turned into heartless freaks, bent on their own self-prever...Self-preter...\nMob Member: \"Preservation?\"\nSpongeBob: Yes! We've become alienated from each other. Each one an island unto himself, concerned only with ourselves. And in the name of all fishhood, I am not about to let that happen!  And so, if a sacrifice is needed to restore Bikini Bottom to its former glory...  then I am willing to take one for the team!\nSquidward: (gloats) You heard him!\nMr. Krabs: Let the sacrifice begin!\nSquidasaurus Rex: And I thought my friends were primitive.\nMr. Krabs: Don't cry, me boy. Everything's gonna be fine. For us.\nSpongeBob: Oh, I'm not crying, Mr. Krabs.  I smell Krabby Patties!\nMr. Krabs: That's right. Keep thinking happy thoughts. Now!  The boy's right.\nFred: My leg!\nMr. Krabs: I smell 'em, too. Ok SpongeBob, Go Get It!\nSquidward: Wait. You mean we can just take this stuff off?\nMr. Krabs: Go find that Krabby Patty!\nSpongeBob: Come on, everybody! I've got some Krabby Patty orders to fill!  It's coming from over there!  Come on, guys! I think it's just over this hill!\nSquidward: How do you expect us to go up to the surface?! We won't be able to breathe!\nCustomer: All right. All secondary characters, come with me.\nSquidward: Yeah, I'm with you guys.\nMr. Krabs: No way, Squidward.  You're going up there with us.\nPatrick: My feet hurt.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you don't have feet.\nPatrick: Well, it's not fair. You have feet. Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.\nSquidward: Actually, I have four feet.\nSpongeBob: It's not about feet.\nSquidward: What is it about then?\nSpongeBob: It's about being a team and sticking together no matter what.\nSquidward: The only way we're going up there is if some fairy godmother shows up and helps us breathe air.\nSpongeBob: Bubbles!\nSquidward: SpongeBob, you know this guy?\nSpongeBob: Don't hurt us! We're sorry we got you fired!\nBubbles: Hurt you?  Why, I traveled back through time to thank you. I've been stuck in that job for eons. I needed a change, but I was too afraid to go for it.\nSpongeBob: Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.\nBubbles: Now, it is my turn to help. I can get you safely to the surface. Now--  Quick, all of you. Get in my mouth.\nSpongeBob: Come on, guys. Let's go.\nSquidward: There's no way I'm climbing into some dolphin's mouth.\nMr. Krabs: Yeah, this guy just wants a free lunch.\nSpongeBob: Guys, if Bubbles has the courage to quit his dead end nowhere job and travel back through time to help us, then we need to have the courage to--\nMr. Krabs: Well, I never thought I'd be eaten by a dolphin.\nSpongeBob: No, if he was eating us, he'd be chewing us up and we'd be going down there. This is what you call \"riding in style.\"\nSquidward: Not a lot of leg room in here.\nPatrick: Well, maybe if you didn't have four feet!\nPlankton: Note to self: Never stow away in a gym sock.\nPatrick: What's happening? I feel tingly.\nSquidward: Ow, my neck.\nBubbles: I've done all I can. The rest is up to you.\nSpongeBob: Thank you, Bubbles!\nBubbles: Farewell, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Farewell, Bubbles!\nBubbles: Now, to update my--  Hmm-m-m  R-r-r\xe9sum\xe9!\nSandy: Ah, fresh air. Oh, how I've missed you.\nSquidward: Ugh! This place smells awful!\nSpongeBob: Come on, guys. Let's get the Krabby Patty formula and save Bikini Bottom.  Whoa. What is this place?\nMr. Krabs: I have a bad feeling about this.\nPatrick: Maybe this guy knows where we are. He looks smart. He's got five heads.\nSpongeBob: Uh, Sir? Could you tell us where to find a Krabby Patty?\nPatrick: Hey, my friend's talking to you!\nSpongeBob: What?  A giant, hairy porpoise! It's beached! It's suffering. Poor thing.\nSandy: Y'all, those aren't porpoises.\nMr. Krabs: All hands on deck!\nSandy: Oh, brother.\nMr. Krabs: We need to get these guys back in the water!\nSpongeBob: Come on, push!\nMr. Krabs: Put your back into it!\nSpongeBob: Come on, push!\nSquidward: Well, I guess this is where that horrible smell was coming from.\nBeach girl: Whoa!\nSpongeBob: Excuse me, do you know where we can get a Krabby Patty around here?\nBeach boy: Invaders!\nSpongeBob: Uh-oh!\nBeach boy: You get off of my sister's sand castle!\nBeach girl: Mom!\nPatrick: Ahh...Where have you been all my life?!\nSquidward: Whoa! Whoa!\nFemale Sunbather: Oh Frank...that's so good.\nFreckled Boy: Gross!\nPatrick: Oh, hey Squidward.\nSpongeBob: Sandy! The Krabby Patty! I think I see where it's coming from!\nSpongeBob and Sandy: Whoa!\nPatrick: SpongeBob, you would not believe the size of the ice creams here.  I wonder what other giant snacks they have.  Cotton candy!\nSpongeBob: Wow.\nSandy: If you ate all that, you'd have enough energy to run around the whole world.\nSquidward: Ugh! When is the sugar gonna wear off?\nSpongeBob: Hey guys. I smell Krabby Patties!  I think it's this way!  Now what?\nSquidward: We're never gonna make it!\nSpongeBob: We're doing it guys!\nSandy: Hold on!\nBaby: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Lean!\nMr. Krabs: What the--?\nSpongeBob: What? \"Home of the Krabby Patty?\" But the Krusty Krab is the home of the Krabby Patty! Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?!\nMr. Krabs: $8.99 for a Krabby Patty?! Why didn't I think of that?  You.  Cease and desist that unauthorized patty flippin'!\nSpongeBob: Yeah. That's my job!\nBurger Beard: How did you get here? You cannot breathe air.\nSpongeBob: Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole and then--\nBurger Beard: Wait! Wait.  That's not in the book.\nMr. Krabs: Book?\nBurger Beard: There's no magical dolphin in this story.\nMr. Krabs: What story?\nBurger Beard: The story of how Bikini Bottom was brought to its knees when its beloved Krabby Patty formula was stolen by me, Burger Beard.\nPatrick: How does it end?\nBurger Beard: Well, let me see. It looks like, um, Burger Beard becomes the richest food truck proprietor in all of the land.\nSpongeBob: But how did you steal the formula?\nBurger Beard: That was easy. I simply rewrote the story and...  Poof!\nMr. Krabs: Me formuler!\nSquidward: What do you mean rewrote the story?\nBurger Beard: Watch this.  The brave and handsome Burger Beard banished...  our poor heroes to be stranded on Pelican Island!  The end!\nSpongeBob: Oh, this looks bad! And these guys look hungry!  Look out!\nSquidward: Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.\nMr. Krabs: Here. Take Squidward, you vile beasts!\nPatrick: I wanna be on a new team. This one's broken.\nSpongeBob: Sandy, you're smart.  You have any ideas?\nSandy: I ain't been too smart since I found this old piece of paper!\nSpongeBob: What?\nMr. Krabs: Incoming!\nSpongeBob: Wait a minute!  Now all we need is some ink...  Oh, which Squidward has helpfully provided.\nSquidward:  It happens when I'm nervous.\nMr. Krabs: Whatever you're gonna do, make it quick! They're closing in on us!\nSpongeBob: I'm gonna write us an ending.\nPatrick: Will it be a happy ending?\nSpongeBob: It's gonna be super-powered!\nPlankton: I'll show you a happy ending.\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Da-da-da-dee!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick!\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Huh?  Hey, I got feet!\nCustomer: Ugh... what is in these things?\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: We'll take one secret formula...  ...to go.  Clear the area, citizens. There is going to be some serious...  ...aft-kicking here.\nBurger Beard: But... I banished you.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Sour Note?\nKyle: My tiny little eardrums!\nBurger Beard: Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on! Wait! Wait! Customers! WAIT PLEASE!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Mr. Superawesomeness, take him down.\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Mmmmmmm!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Uhh, Maybe we should have picked a better superpower for you, Patrick.\nBurger Beard: Let's see you get out of this one!\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Ka-ching!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Get ready for the Invincibubble!\nBurger Beard: No! My book!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: All right, team. Time for hands in the middle!\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Yes! Huh?  Oh yeah.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Great job, guys, we did it!\nPatrick: Huh?\nSandy/The Rodent: What?\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Sandy? Is that you?\nSandy/The Rodent: You can call me The Rodent! Hi-yah!\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness : Hey. Where'd the pirate go?\nSquidward/Sour Note: Hmm. Uh...\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Hmm. It looks like Burger Beard forgot the first rule of mobile fry-cooking: Always batten down your grease traps.\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Follow that grease, team!\nBurger Beard: There she blows.\nBurger Beard: Oh no, you don't.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Whoa!  He's after the book! Sandy, use your squirrel powers!\nSandy/The Rodent: Roger that!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Oh, she's never gonna make it!  Huh? Everyone lean!\nAndy: That's what you get.\nBurger Beard: Come here.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: The book! Sour Note!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: All right, Burger Beard, prepare to be teamworked!\nBurger Beard: I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Uh, I don't get it.\nSquidward/Sour Note: Because you're a sponge.\nBurger Beard: Duh.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Oh. Get him, The Rodent!\nSandy/The Rodent: Consider him roasted!  Huh?  Aw, nuts, I'm all out of nuts!\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomenesss: Justice is best...soft served.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick, I should have never doubted your powers!\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: I can't think of a sweeter way to go.\nBurger Beard: Ha! It's all MINE!\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Not so fast, Booger Beard!  Me formuler.  Huh?\nBurger Beard: This will make you feel a little butter.\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Not melted butter!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Mr. Krabs!\nBurger Beard: Voila!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Uh-oh.  Huh?\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: They're beautiful.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick!\nBurger Beard: I gotcha!\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Patrick?\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Talk to me, buddy.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Is this better?\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Much. Thank you. But the discomfort I feel in my eyes is nothing compared to the shame I feel for letting down the Patty. For letting down Bikini Bottom.\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: No, Patrick, we blew it, as a team.\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Nope, this one's on you.\nPlankton: Where do you think you're going?\nBurger Beard: Why don't you get going, little fella, before you hurt yourself?\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Plankton?\nPlankton/Plank-ton: It's Plank-Ton!  Come on down from there, little fella. You wouldn't wanna get hurt. Huh?  Come out, come out wherever you are. Huh?  Yah! My eye!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: He's getting away!\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles?\nPlankton/Plank-ton: The formula, please.\nBurger Beard: Come on. Team up with me. We'll be rich and powerful! Huh?\nPlankton/Plank-ton: No, thanks. I'm already part of a teamwork.\nPatrick/Mr. Superawesomeness: Can we do hands in the middle again?\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Yes, we can, Patrick. But this time there's one more hand to go in the middle.  Plankton?\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Hmm.\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Oh, no.\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Here you go, Krabs.\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: Huh?\nPlankton/Plank-ton: She's all yours.\nMr. Krabs/Sir Pinch-a-lot: This doesn't have another insulting note in it, does it?\nPlankton/Plank-ton: No, that's the old me. The one who turned his back on everything important just to have that formula all to himself. But I realize now that keeping something to myself is... ...selfish.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Especially when that something is the Krabby Patty. Okay, everybody, let's get back to Bikini Bottom and...  Oh, no! I don't have the page!\nSandy/The Rodent: Oh, no!\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: It must be back on Pelican Island!\nPlankton/Plank-ton: Don't worry. I thought of everything.  All right, SpongeBob, take us home.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Thanks. Squidward!\nSquidward/Sour Note: Oh, yeah.\nSpongeBob/Invincibubble: Come on, it's time to go back and open up The Krusty Krab!\nSquidward/Sour Note: Are you out of your patty-flipping mind?  I'll never leave this place! I mean, look at me. I'm a god!\nSpongeBob/Invinicibubble: No, Squidward, you're a cashier.\nSquidward/Sour Note: Wait a minute! What? No!  Well, it was fun while it lasted.\nSpongeBob: Don't be sad, Squidward. I left you a little surprise under your shirt!\nSquidward: Rock-hard abs!  Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.\nSpongeBob: Aw, shucks.\nScooter: Excuse us! We'd like 3,000 Krabby Patties Please!\nSquidward: That sound must mean things are back to normal.\nSpongeBob: Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?  First one's for you, Gary. Extra mayo, just the way you like it.\nSpongeBob: A-ha! Caught you red-handed! Gary hates mayo!  Plankton! Up to your old tricks again already, eh?\nPlankton: Hey, I'm just putting things back the way they were.\nSpongeBob: What do you have to say about this, Gary?\nPlankton: Oh, shrimp.\nSpongeBob: See you later, te-am-mate!\nSeagull: Now can we sing it?\nKyle: Pwease, Mr. Piwate?\nBurger Beard: Oh, Kyle... How can I say no to you?  Are you ready, kids?!\nSeagulls: Aye-aye, Captain.\nBurger Beard: Uh, what did you say? There's sand in my ears and I can't hear you!\nSeagulls: Aye-aye, Captain!\nBubbles: Stop it. That's enough!  Silence!\nSeagull: Oh, man. I like that song.
