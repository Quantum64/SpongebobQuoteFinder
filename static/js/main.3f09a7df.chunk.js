I think...\nSpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it!  Yeah!\nPatrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.\nSpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me!  Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier!\nPatrick: Alien hunting!

Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.\nMr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition.

I wasn't ready for those blessed boots.\nMr. Krabs: Poor lad.\nTom: Excuse me?\nMr. Krabs: I didn't do it!  Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?\nTom: Yeah, I'm ready to order.\nMr. Krabs: What'll ya have?\nTom: I'll take a .\nMr. Krabs: What did you say?\nTom: I said, I'll take a .\nMr. Krabs: Huh?\nSpongeBob: I heard his order, Mr. Krabs.

The deed is done.\nSpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.\nSpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: I do, son.  Here's the paycheck I owe you.  Plus a bonus!  Well, there's your paycheck anyway.  I need a vacation.\nSpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.\nPearl: Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!\nMr. Krabs: Darling, I won't.

This is your natural habitat.  This is your wide open range.  These are your amber waves.  And thisoh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule!

Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?\nSpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.\nSandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright.\nSpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy.  Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye.  I won't be needing these.  Buzz, buzz, buzz.\nSquidward: He took off his pants.\nSandy: I'll give him a week.\nSquidward: I'll give him eleven minutes.\nPatrick: Patrick sad!\nSpongeBob: I'm home. I'm home! I'm home!

I can sell your home in a heartbeat.\nSquidward: Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.\nPatty: No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.\nSquidward: Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say \"neighbors?\"\nPatty: Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.\nSquidward: Neighbors. Uhh...\nPatty: Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite...\nSpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum?\nSquidward: Drum? What drum?  This is just my wig case! See?  Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!\nSpongeBob: Squidward!

Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!\nSpongeBob: Does everybody know about Opposite Day?\nSquidward: Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?\nSpongeBob: Oh, a game.\nSquidward: Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?\nSpongeBob: Quiet and out of the way! Yay!\nSquidward: Yeah!

I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard,  but that really means he's messing it up.  But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means,  Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!  A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being...  Squidward!\nPatrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite, too!  Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo!  I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.\nSpongeBob: Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite...  ...you have to act like him, too.

Mr. Tentacles?\nSpongeBob: Yes, please come in.\nPatty: It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, everyone says that.\nPatty: Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.\nSpongeBob: Positive things! Opposite Day...  I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.\nPatty: Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.\nSpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard!  Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?\nPatty: Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...\nSpongeBob: Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer.  Please follow me.  And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.\nPatty: Oh my, this painting is very nice.\nPatrick: Thank you!\nPatty: Who's that?!\nSpongeBob: I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.\nPatty: You're both Squidward?\nSpongeBob: I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're both Squidward.\nSquidward: Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet.  NO!\nPatty: Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.\nSpongeBob: Okay.\nPatty: I really don't want to hear more, thank you.\nSpongeBob: I hear you loud and clear.\nSquidward: Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two  barnacle heads  haven't harmed you in any way.\nPatty: Who are you?\nSquidward: Why, I'm Squidward!\nPatty: What kind of fool do you take me for?! He's Squidward, he's Squidward, you're Squidward?! I'm Squidward! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?\nGary: Meow.\nPatty: I'm outta here.\nSquidward: Ma'am, please! What about my house?!\nPatty: I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on earth!\nSquidward: Wait!\nSpongeBob: Don't...\nPatrick: ...Go!\nSquidward: No, no, no, no, no!\nPatty: Stop! Stop!\nSquidward: Please, sell my house!\nPatty: Never!\nSquidward: Don't leave me here!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you!\nSquidward: Let me show you guys how much I... hate you!\nSpongeBob: Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?\nSquidward: Happy Opposite Day!\n","10a\nCulture Shock\nMr. Krabs: Hmm...

Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month.  We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers.  Do you lubbers have any ideas?\nSpongeBob: I've got one!  A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams...  ...gets a free drink! Huh?

The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes.  Tennis shoes. I crack myself up.\nLisa: We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...\nSpongeBob: Wow!

He's finally stolen me secret recipe!\nNarrator: Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's...  ...SpongeBob SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: A-ha!  Hey!  Okay, that's far enough! Huh?  Tartar sauce!\nCowboy: Yeehaw!\nSpongeBob: Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and...  Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true.\nPlankton: Argh! I can't take it!\nSpongeBob: Plankton! It's you!\nPlankton: Yes, and after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser.\nSpongeBob: Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.\nPlankton: Wh-what did you say?\nSpongeBob: I said, you're a--\nAll: Loser!\nSquidward: How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?!

Our special today is chum...  ...balaya.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Plankton.\nPlankton: Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?\nSpongeBob: No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.\nPlankton: What?\nSpongeBob: Play with me.\nPlankton: You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?\nSpongeBob: No, but I like to go jelly...\nPlankton: That na\xefve cube! How long must I suffer this?\nKaren: You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!\nPlankton: Elaborate.\nKaren: Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!\nPlankton: Take the Krabby Patty?\nKaren: Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.\nSpongeBob: ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.\nPlankton: Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.\nSpongeBob: Great!  Last one to the fields is a rotten clam!  So, I get the big net and you get the little net.\nPlankton: What happens after we eat 'em?\nSpongeBob: You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this!  Like that.\nPlankton: And?\nSpongeBob: And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!\nPlankton: Stingers?  All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win!  I win, I wi--\nSpongeBob: It's not about winning, it's about fun!\nPlankton: What's that?\nSpongeBob: Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...\nSpongeBob: What is fun?

That's completely idiotic!\nSpongeBob: Here, let me help you. \u266aF is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.\u266a Try it!\nPlankton: \u266aN is for anywhere, anytime at all!\u266a\nClams: \u266aDown here in the deep blue sea!\u266a\nPlankton: Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?\nSpongeBob: No! That's how you're suppose to feel!\nPlankton: Well, I like it. Let's do it again!\nSpongeBob: Okay!\nSpongeBob and Plankton: \u266aF is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!\u266a\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, mutiny.\nPlankton: And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...\nKaren: Sounds like fun.\nPlankton: Well, the really fun part was when we...\nKaren: What did you do with the Krabby Patty?\nPlankton: The what?\nKaren: The Krabby Patty, remember?\nPlankton: You can't rush these things, you know.\nKaren: You're forgetting about the mission!\nPlankton: What are you talking about?\nKaren: You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself!\nPlankton: What?\nMr. Krabs: I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.\nSpongeBob: Who knows? Maybe he's changed.\nMr. Krabs: Who knows? I think you knows!\nSpongeBob: He's changed, I tell you!\nPlankton: SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo!\nSpongeBob: Plankton-buddy! Let\u2019s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private.  You won't mind if I set this here, will you?\nSpongeBob: What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...\nSpongeBob: Why can't you just accept our friendship?\nMr. Krabs: He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you.  Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.\nPlankton: Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.\nMr. Krabs: Uhh... suit yourself.\nSpongeBob: We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs!  Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here.\nMr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight.  Or maybe scallops will fly out of my pants!  Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin!\nSpongeBob: I sure like sequels, Plankton.  Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend.  Hey, Bubble Bass!\nPlankton: Thanks for that, friend.\nSpongeBob: Sure thing.\nMr. Krabs: Listen up!\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got!  You too, boy!\nSpongeBob: I cant believe this!\nPlankton: It's not what you think.\nSpongeBob: What is it then? Tell me what you see here!\nPlankton: I... I don't see anything.\nSpongeBob: How can you not see it!?\nPlankton: Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay?! I couldn't help it!\nSpongeBob: But we sang The F.U.N. Song!  I think I'm gonna be sick! How long?\nPlankton: How long what?\nSpongeBob: How long were you planning on doing this?!  Tell me!\nSpongeBob: What?!\nPlankton: All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship!  And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!\nSpongeBob: Really?\nPlankton: No, not really. Being evil is too much fun!\nMovie Man: Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.\nMr Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what\u2019s behind these screens? Solid concrete!\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.\nMr. Krabs: Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Well, maybe on a discount.\n","11a\nMuscleBob BuffPants\nSandy: Howdy, SpongeBob.

I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.\nPearl: Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun.\nMr. Krabs: A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower!  You almost stepped on it.\nPearl: Oh, daddy! Well, good night, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob?\nMr. Krabs: Good job, laddie.\nSpongeBob: Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! .\n","e12b\nEmployee of the Month\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward. Hey, Squidward.\nSquidward: All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Do you know what today is?\nSquidward: Annoy Squidward Day?\nSpongeBob: No, silly!  That's on the 15th!  Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?\nSpongeBob: What do you mean?\nSquidward: Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money.\nSpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.\nSquidward: Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame?\nSpongeBob: Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.\nMr. Krabs: Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner!  Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout.  There might be a new face on the wall this month.\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nSquidward: That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you.\nSpongeBob: Nooo!  How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?!\nSquidward: Need some help?  What are you doing?\nSpongeBob: Making...Krabby Patties?\nSquidward: You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of--  ...garbage.\nSpongeBob: Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!\nSquidward: I already told you, that award is a bunch of...  ...baloney!\nSpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...\nSquidward: It's a symbol that you're a chump!\nSpongeBob: No, Squidward!\nSquidward: And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award!\nSpongeBob: An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.\nSquidward: I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke!\nSpongeBob: What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?!\nSpongeBob Picture: Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!\nSpongeBob: But, sir\u2026\nSpongeBob Picture: There's no room for \"buts\" in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?\nSpongeBob: Crystal, sir!\nSpongeBob Picture: Good! Now move out!\nSpongeBob: I won't let Squidward win!  He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited.\nSquidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here?\nSpongeBob: You can't win that award if you don't get up for work!\nSquidward: Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!\nSpongeBob: That can be arranged.\nSquidward: You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.\nSquidward: Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!\nSpongeBob: I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.\nSquidward: Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!\nSpongeBob: Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!\nSquidward: Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!\nSpongeBob: Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!\nSquidward: I don't need to sleep! Loser!\nSpongeBob: Well, me neither! \u202626-time loser!  Look at him. Watchin' me.\nSquidward: I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?\nSquidward: No, how about you?\nSpongeBob: Nope!  Nighty Night.\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?\nSquidward: I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!\nSpongeBob: All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Now to get some rest. Don't want to look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo!  Squidward!\nSquidward: That oughta hold him!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! Why, you little\u2026!\nSpongeBob: Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty!  Ow! Squidward!\nSquidward: So long, Sponge loser!  SpongeBob? Truce?\nSpongeBob: Truce.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!\nSpongeBob: You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it.\nSquidward: Okay, let's have a good clean fight.\nSpongeBob: And may the better man win.  He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!\nSquidward: Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.\nSpongeBob: As soon as he stops shaking my hand...\nSquidward: ...I'm gonna make a run for it.\nMr. Krabs: Money, money, gonna make some money!  Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early!  Wait!\nSpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!\nSquidward: Clean tables, Mr. Krabs!\nSpongeBob: Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: What's going on here?!\nSpongeBob: It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: No!\nSquidward: Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!\nSpongeBob: Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs!  Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!\nSquidward: There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double your output, SpongeHog!\nMr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys!  Help! Help!\nFrank: Hey, free Krabby Patties!\nMr. Krabs: Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait! Wait! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties!\nSpongeBob: So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?\nSquidward: Me, me! It's me!\nMr. Krabs: Boys! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!\n","13a\nScaredy Pants\nNarrator: Halloween is no different under the waves. Pirates, skeletons, and sea monsters.  Ohh, sorry. Everyone having fun. Well, almost everyone.\nSpongeBob: Huh? Who's there?\nSpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving!\nMr. Krabs: Hold on. Don't you want to hear my annual scary story?\nSpongeBob: No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?\nMr. Krabs: Aye, the worst monster of them all.\nSpongeBob: Uhh... no.  Is it a true story?\nMr. Krabs: True as the deep blue.\nSpongeBob: Okay, maybe just a little.\nMr. Krabs: Have a seat, me boy.  Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this.  Only bigger!\nSpongeBob: Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?\nMr. Krabs: Like I was saying, the Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people's souls.\nSpongeBob: Do souls look like pickles?\nMr. Krabs: Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them... in his soul bag.\nSquidward: I've come for your pickle.\nMr. Krabs: Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year!\nSpongeBob: Humph, Squidward!\nMr. Krabs: Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you're not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants!\nSquidward: Steal your soul.\nKid: Twick-ow-tweat!\nMother: It's okay, son. That's just SpongeBob ScaredyPants.\nMrs. Puff: Happy Halloween, ScaredyPants.\nSpongeBob: The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants!  I don't get it, Gary.

I'm going to scare him! It's my turn.  Rawr!\nPatrick: Hiya, SpongeBob!  Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\nSpongeBob: Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?\nPatrick: Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume.\nSpongeBob: What do you think?\nPatrick: Great! You're going as my trick-or-treat bag!\nSpongeBob: No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!\nPatrick: Uhh... something's missing. I know!  Step into these babies, Hans.  Terrifying.\nSpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick.\nPatrick: Come on, SpongeBob.

Oooh, scary.\nSpongeBob: That is it, Patrick!\nPatrick: What's it?\nSpongeBob: What's the difference between that ghost and me?\nPatrick: No, no, no wait. Don't tell me.  D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Okay, tell me.\nSpongeBob: I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary!\nPatrick: Okay, are you ready?\nSpongeBob: Remember, like this.\nPatrick: Are you sure you want to do this?\nSpongeBob: Shave me down, make me round!\nPatrick: All right, let's get to it.\nSpongeBob: What do you think?\nPatrick: Perfect.

I'm the Flying Dutchman!\nPatrick: Oooh, I'm the Flying Dutchman's best friend!\nMan: Hey, don't you kids want your candy?\nPatrick: Oh, boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch.\nSpongeBob: Do you think?\nPatrick: Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!\nSpongeBob: Who should we scare next?\nPatrick: There's a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited!  Here comes someone now!\nSpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr!

I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I'm going to steal your souls.  Quiet!  You had it coming, you little crybabies. Every year, people dressing up like me.  Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls.  No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.\nSpongeBob: Do you mean I'm not scary?\nFlying Dutchman: You? Scary?!  Let me tell you about scary, kid. There's all kinds of scary things in the world. Spiders are scary, uhh, I'm scary. You... you're not scary. Okay, let's get this over with.\nSandy: SpongeBob!\nFlying Dutchman: First, I gotta get rid of this stupid costume.\nSpongeBob: Hey, what do you know? I scared him!  It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody!\nPatrick: Yeah, I guess it was your pink hat.\nSpongeBob: Pink hat? Oh, that's not a hat.

The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!\nSquidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.\nSpongeBob: You'll do it? Great!

Well, you can't! \u2018Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this!  Ssss!  Took care of her, yes I did.  Oh, ahoy, sir!\nMr. Krabs: What was that?\nSpongeBob: But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.\nMr. Krabs: Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?\nSpongeBob: No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it.\nMr. Krabs: Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.\nSpongeBob: Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet?\nSpongeBob: Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!\nSquidward: Go!\nSpongeBob: Hah!

How am I gonna tell Sandy?\nSandy: Hi-yah!\nSpongeBob: Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate.\nSandy: Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop.\nSandy: I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: No, really! Please, stop!\nMr. Krabs: What the?

Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault! It's- it's mine! He tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen!  Give him another chance, please?\nMr. Krabs: Hmmm.  Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind.  Mmm, mammals.\nSandy: Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing.  Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about  this?\nSpongeBob: Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!\nSandy: We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.\nSpongeBob: We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh.  We can squeeze things!  Woo! How much fun was that?\nSandy: Almost some.\nSpongeBob: I know! We can act like plants.  Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.\nSandy: Wanna go to the park?\nSpongeBob: Karate sure is dumb.\nSandy: Yeah, you can say that again.\nSpongeBob: I feel dumb just thinking about it.  Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!\nSandy: You like what?\nSpongeBob: Not karate.\nSandy: Ha! I don't even know what that is.\nSpongeBob: Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...\nFisherman: Hi-yah! Hi-yah!\nSpongeBob: For a second, that sounded like.\nSandy: Karate?\nSpongeBob: Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate?  Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?\nSandy: Karate.\nSpongeBob: What did you say?\nSandy: Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich.

Hi-yah!  Is that enough?\nSpongeBob: Maybe just one more. Or two!\nSandy: Or three!\nSpongeBob: Or ten!\nSandy: Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSandy: Right!\nSpongeBob: Right!\nSandy: Right!\nSpongeBob: Time for buns!\nSandy: How about some tomatoes?\nSpongeBob: And I'll cut the cheese!\nSandy: And, what else should we slice?\nSpongeBob: More buns!\nSandy: And lettuce!\nBoth: Yeah!\nSpongeBob: Phew.

Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.\nMr. Krabs: Fire ya?  I've got something else in mind.\nSandy: I love karate!\nSpongeBob: I love kara-tay!\nMr. Krabs: I love money-ay!\nSquidward: I hate all of you.\n","e15a\nSleepy Time\nSpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary.\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary.  You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary.  Hey! Over here!  Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license!  Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it!  I sure take a good picture.  Darn! I should have grown a mustache.  How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt.  Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here.  Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!\nMrs. Puff: Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!\nSpongeBob: No!  Ouch! Where am I?  Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?\nGary: Meow.  Meow.\nSpongeBob: This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look.  Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is.  Gary! Huh?  Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...?\nGary: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Gary?\nGary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?\nSpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!\nGary: In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.\nSpongeBob: What does that mean?\nGary: Come.  For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm.  \"Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again.\" Emily Dickinson wrote that.\nSpongeBob: Who?\nGary: Here's one you might know.  There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.\nSpongeBob: Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.\nGary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?\nSpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now.\nGary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!\nSpongeBob: I wonder what Patrick's dreaming.  I can't resist!  Hey, Patrick!\nPatrick: Hi, SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.\nPatrick: Yup.\nSpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper.  Going up! Eh?  I can make...  A million of me! Eh? Eh?\nPatrick: Yup.\nSpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream.\nPatrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob.  Oh!  Shoot, that was my last quarter.\nSpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good!  Psst! Squidward!  Hey, Squidward!\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nKing: Ahem!  Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?\nSquidward: Yes, Your Highness.  SpongeBob!\nKing: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play!  Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.\nSquidward: Sponge-  Bob...\nKing: I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!\nSpongeBob: Squidward!  Huh? Huh?\nSquidward: No way.\nKing: Ahem!\nSquidward: Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.\nSpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward.\nSpongeBob: La la! La la la la la la la!\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nKing: Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?\nFish: His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.\nSquidward: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\nFish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?\nSpongeBob: So long, Squidward!\nSpongeBob: Hey! I'm at Sandy's!  Aw, this looks neat! I wonder...\nSandy: Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?\nSpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?\nSandy: Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target.\nSpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!\nSandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!\nSpongeBob: Okay!\nSandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute!\nSpongeBob: Gotcha!\nSandy: Not a parakeet! Para-  medic...\nSpongeBob: Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams.  H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs.  Uhh... Mr. Krabs?\nPearl: Hello, SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.\nPearl: You're just in time for the tea party!\nSpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.\nPearl: Oh. He's next door.  Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?\nSpongeBob: Bye!  I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust.\nKrabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon!  You're putting up a good fight, yes you are.\nSpongeBob: Whatcha doin\u2019, Mr. Krabs?\nKrabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!\nSpongeBob: What are you talking about?\nKrabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash.  It's the mighty Moby Dollar!  Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes!  There she blows!\nSpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!\nKrabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!\nSpongeBob: This one?\nKrabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.\nSpongeBob: Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.\nKrabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!\nSpongeBob: Net ready, sir!\nKrabs: I did it!  I finally did it!\nSpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs.\nKrabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!\nSpongeBob: Huh?\nKrabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!\nSpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!\nKrabs: No!\nSpongeBob: This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?\nKrabs: Oh, SpongeBob...\nSpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?\nKrabs: You're fired!\nSpongeBob: Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.\nPlankton: Zap!  I see you.  Zap!\nFred: My leg!\nPlankton: I see you. Zap!\nSpongeBob: Plankton!\nPlankton: I see you...  Zap!  Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty.  Crush!  Lick, lick!\nSpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!\nGary: Meow! Meow!\nSpongeBob: Gary! Gary! No!\nGary: Meow!\nPlankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.\nSpongeBob: Gary!  I've got you, Gary!\nPlankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot!  Yeah! Huh?  Yow!\nSpongeBob: I think he's got the point.\nPlankton: Waaaaaah!  Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh?  No! No! No! Not the face!\nSpongeBob: Ooh!  Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud.  Ah...\nSquidward: SpongeBob!\nSandy: SpongeBob!\nKrabs: SpongeBob!\nPatrick: SpongeBob!\nPlankton: SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no!\nSquidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?\nSquidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!\nSandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!\nPlankton: Take a hike!\nSquidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?\nGary: Meow!\nPatrick: Does anyone have a quarter?\n","e15b\nSuds\nSpongeBob: Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah!  A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed.  Aww, sleep tight, my little angel.  Ah, here it is.  Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to get you to sleep.  The fridge!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I can't get the suds,  because then I'll have to miss work!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I'm not sick. I'm going to work.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties?\nSpongeBob: Right away, sir.\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse.\nGary: Meow.\nMr. Krabs: The suds?\nSpongeBob: Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir.\nMr. Krabs: Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work.\nSpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest.\nMr. Krabs: No, now go home and get some rest.  Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food!  No, wait! Wait!\nSpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I feel horrible.  Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it.  I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand.\nSandy: Hello?\nSpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sick.  Can you escort me to the doctor's?\nSandy: Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I'll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in...\nSpongeBob: Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks.  Coming.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?\nSpongeBob: I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.\nPatrick: What? Oh, you can't go!\nSpongeBob: Why not, Patrick?\nPatrick: I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!\nSpongeBob: It can't be as horrible as the suds.\nPatrick: Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well, first, they make you sit in the waiting room.\nSpongeBob: Is that the horrible part, Patrick?\nPatrick: No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines!  Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.\nSpongeBob: No!\nPatrick: Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it...  Ssssss!\nSpongeBob: No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No!  Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.\nPatrick: Exactly.\nSpongeBob: You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?\nPatrick: What else are friends for?  It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick.  Voil\xe0!  Feel better?\nSpongeBob: I don't know.\nPatrick: Help, I'm shrinking!  No! Please don't hurt me!\nSpongeBob: No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!\nPatrick: You think so?\nSpongeBob: Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!\nPatrick: And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.\nSpongeBob: My fingers are too big for the buttons.  Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me?\nPatrick: Sure, patient SpongeBob.  Hello, Sandy?\nSandy: Hiya, Patrick.\nPatrick: I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.\nSandy: I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital.\nPatrick: Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.\nSandy: Well, I'm coming over to take a look. I'll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot...\nPatrick: Oh, yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy!  Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! Ah! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor!  Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please.  Feeling better?\nSpongeBob: Uh-uh.\nPatrick: Feeling better yet?\nSpongeBob: Not really.\nPatrick: How...about...now?\nSpongeBob: I don't...think so.\nPatrick: Feeling better?\nSpongeBob: No.\nPatrick: How about now?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nPatrick: How about now?\nSpongeBob: Uh-uh.\nSandy: Hello, SpongeBob?\nPatrick: Uh-oh, it's Sandy.  There's no one home.\nSandy: Patrick, you open this door.  Patrick, sometimes I just don't understand you.  Hey!  Okay, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?\nPatrick: Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.\nSandy: Okay, now tell me,  since when do you have two houses?\nPatrick: Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.\nSandy: Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when does your house have feet?\nPatrick: This is my mobile home.\nSpongeBob: Hiya, Sandy.\nPatrick: Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.\nSandy: Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor.\nPatrick: No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.\nSpongeBob: Ahh...\nSandy: See? He's even worse than I thought.\nPatrick: What do you mean? He's fine.\nSpongeBob: I'm okay, Sandy, really.\nSandy: I'm taking you to the doctor right now.\nPatrick: Hey, that's my patient!  You can't take him to the doctor's.\nSandy: Don't be silly, Patrick!\nPatrick: He's mine!\nSandy: SpongeBob, you'll be better soon.\nPatrick: I'll save you!\nSpongeBob: I'm better, guys! Really!\nSandy: Now look what you've done, Patrick!\nPatrick: What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up.\nSandy: You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor!\nPatrick: I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Guys!\nSandy: Huh?\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: I can't stop now!  Help me!\nMr. Krabs: Shiny dimes.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: SpongeBob?  Stop! SpongeBob! Stop!\nPurple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. SquarePants, it seems you have the suds.

Whoo!  This tickles!  I can smell again!  Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah!  I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!\nHans: Here is your lollipop.\nPatrick: A lollipop?  Hey, doc, I\u2019ve got the suds, too.\nPurple Doctorfish: Oh, yes, Dr. Patrick, we have a special treatment for you.\nPatrick: Hey! Hey, wait!  Ouch! That hurts!  Wait, this doesn't seem right!\n","16a\nValentine's Day\nSpongeBob: Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom!\nSandy: Happy Valentine's Day, SpongeBob.

Cotton candy!\nCotton Candy Seller: Hey, get away! Hey!\nSandy: Sandy to SpongeBob.  Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in SpongeBob.\nSpongeBob: Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here.\nSandy: I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?\nSpongeBob: Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.\nSandy: You are such a kidder, Sandy out. That SpongeBob...  Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!\nPatrick: So if it's not cotton candy, then what is it?

Landing just in time for the bullfight!  Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro...  Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a mustache.  Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache. A pirate with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I'm a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch.  Arrgh, I am not a pirate.\nSquidward: Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper.  How did he do that?\nSpongeBob: Look, Gary, oral-gami.\nKids: Bird! Yay!  Snowflake, yay!  Paper dolls, yay!\nSquidward: Hey, that little paper does seem like fun.  What am I saying?! I am such an idiot.  SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun?  Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun.  Erosion.  Mitosis.  See, I can have fun taking a bath.  Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything.  I'll prove to him that paper is not fun!  I'm having fun, la-la-la...\nSpongeBob: Isn't this great? La-la-la-la-la...  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\nSquidward: Okay, SpongeBob, top this one.  Hey, Lil' Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?\nLil' Squidward: I don't know, but have you looked in the mirror lately?\nSquidward: What? What did you...?\nSpongeBob: Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try.  Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper?\nPaper: What happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?\nSpongeBob: I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?\nPaper: It was all washed up!\nSpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\nSquidward: Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this?\nSpongeBob: Nope.\nSquidward: Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper!\nSpongeBob: Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original.\nSquidward: What? I didn't play any wrong notes.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, see, you're playing it like this...  ...when ordinarily it goes like this...  I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself.  Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?\nSquidward: Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it!  Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go...\nSpongeBob: I can't!\nSquidward: What do you mean you can't?\nSpongeBob: I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever.\nSquidward: I never said anything like that!\nSpongeBob: Sure you did, Squidward, look.\nSquidward: Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me\u2026 ever!\nSpongeBob: Wanna see it again?\nSquidward: No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.\nSpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise.  Maybe I should get going.\nSquidward: Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something.  Yeah-yeah, something, something...  A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum.  I'm going to make you an offer.\nSpongeBob: Wow, pocket lint!  You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...\nSquidward: Not the lint, the rubber band!\nSpongeBob: The rubber band? Do I dare?\nSquidward: Oh, dare, dare!\nSpongeBob: Okay...  Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise.\nSquidward: Listen, you!  You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal.  Gotta get that paper.\nSpongeBob: Squidward?\nSquidward: Trade...\nSpongeBob: Hey, listen...\nSquidward: Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it.  I've given you everything but the shirt off my back.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise.\nSquidward: Okay, the shirt!  Take it! Take my shirt!\nSpongeBob: Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade!  I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, \u2018cause this is all I'll need?\nSquidward: You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage.  I got it! Haha and you can't have it.  I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker!  At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose.  Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait...  Tada!\nChildren: Boo!\nSquidward: Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter!  Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now.  I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying...  ...flying.  Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground!  A guy stomping on the piece of paper  I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a...\nPatrick: ...a worthless piece of paper.  Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward.  Nice shirt, SpongeBob.\nSquidward: Does anybody have any sunscreen?\n","17a\nArrgh!\nMr. Krabs: Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I surely break out in a rash!\nSpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!\nMr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! Hah!  Mine, mine! Huh?!\nSpongeBob: Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.\nMr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the doubloons?\nSpongeBob: There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: \"The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt\".\nPatrick: Based on a real treasure map.\nSpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.\nPatrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty.\nMr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?\nSpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?\nSpongeBob: I already took care of it.\nMr. Krabs: Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.\nPatrick: My turn.  Five.  One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm.  It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired!\nPatrick: But I don't even work here!\nMr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now?\nPatrick: Boy, would I?!\nMr. Krabs: You're fired!\nSpongeBob: My turn.  One, two, three, four.  Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way.  Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.\nMr. Krabs: Shiver me timbers!\nSpongeBob: Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.\nSpongeBob: You are a real pirate. Go straight to the \"X\" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Treasure.  There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.\nFred: Rev up those fryers, \u2018cause I am sure hungry for one--  Help! Help!  My leg!\nMr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed?!  Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!\nMr. Krabs: Six! One, two...  I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.\nSpongeBob: I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.\nSpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs.  See you tomorrow.  Huh? Who's there?\nMr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta...\nMr. Krabs: That's awful, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...\nMr. Krabs: I'll roll for you, boy.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr...\nMr. Krabs: Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr...\nMr. Krabs: One, two, three...\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! I wanna go to bed! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?\nMr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad.  Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.\nSpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: That\u2019s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.\nSpongeBob: Pirates?\nMr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Treasure?  We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!\nMr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip.  Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.\nSpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.\nMr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?\nSpongeBob: Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate!\nPatrick: I'm Blind Beard the Pirate.\nSpongeBob: Ow.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh!  Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.\nSpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?\nMr. Krabs: Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.\nSpongeBob: Okie dokie, then.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, \"okie dokie, then.\" A pirate says, \"arrgh!\"\nSpongeBob: Okie... oops.  I mean...  arrgh! Captain Krabs.  Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...\nMr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!\nPatrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...!  land...\nMr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?\nSpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.\nMr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has...  Which way, captain?\nMr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?\nPatrick: Uhh... let's see, uhh...  that way, captain!\nMr. Krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the \"X\"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.\nPatrick: Ooh! East? I thought you said \"weast\"!\nMr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?\nPatrick: This one, sir.\nMr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again.  9,551... 9,552...\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.\nPatrick: And hungry.\nMr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew...  what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand!\nPatrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew.\nMr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!\nMr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one!\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.\nPatrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.\nSpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.\nPatrick: I know.\nSpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?\nSpongeBob: He's not here.\nPatrick: Look! The treasure map.\nSpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.\nPatrick: Yeah...\nSpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?\nPatrick: Nothing.\nSpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map.\nPatrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?\nSpongeBob: No, guess there isn't.  Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it.\nPatrick: SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\nPatrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?\nSpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?\nMr. Krabs: Do you think this is a problem?\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Mr. Krabs!\nMr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?\nPatrick: We're sorry.\nMr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?\nSpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!\nPatrick: I think that.\nMr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!\nSpongeBob: Look! It's the \"X\".\nMr. Krabs: \"X\" marks the spot!\nSpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.\nMr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.\nSpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads. Heave!\nMr. Krabs: We finally found it.\nFemale Singers: The Dutchman's Treasure.\nAll: Wow!\nSpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?\nPatrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?\nMr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!\nSpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!\nMr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!\nSpongeBob: What about loyalty?\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob: And one for all.\nFlying Dutchman: I'm the Flying Dutchman.  Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.\nMr. Krabs: All for one.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all.\nFlying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?\nMr. Krabs: They did!\nFlying Dutchman: Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!\nFlying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.\nSpongeBob: Wow!\nFemale Singers: Two Gold Doubloons.\nMr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?\nFlying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble.\nMr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.\nFemale Singers: Plastic!\nFlying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest.\nPatrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.\n","17b\nRock Bottom\nSpongeBob: Another funtastic day at Glove World!\nBus Driver: Ahem.\nSpongeBob: Let me get my wallet.  Wait, let me check this pocket.  No...  Patrick, do you have any change?\nPatrick: How much do you need?\nSpongeBob: How much is it?\nBus Driver: Fifty cents.\nSpongeBob: Fifty cents.\nPatrick: Nope.\nSpongeBob: Lemme check my other poc-\nBus Driver: Forget it!\nSpongeBob: What did you say?\nBus Driver: Just take your seat!\nSpongeBob: Thanks, mister.\nBus Driver: Yeah, whatev-\nPatrick: Show me what you got at Glove World!\nSpongeBob: Okay! Here's my glove light.\nPatrick: Wow...\nSpongeBob: I see you!\nPatrick: I got gloves for my glove action-figure!\nSpongeBob: Cool!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Yeah, Patrick?\nPatrick: Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?\nSpongeBob: Where did you see that?\nPatrick: We just passed the sign. 'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'.\nSpongeBob: What?\nPatrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong...  ...buuuuuuuuuuus!.... ...bus!  But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.\nBus Driver: Oh, well.\nPatrick: What is this, SpongeBob?\nSpongeBob: Rock Bottom.  It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different.\nGreen Soil: Do you...  mind...  putting me down?\nPatrick: Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know.  Maybe we should wait for one more.\nPatrick: I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule.  Boy, this place sure is creepy.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here.  SpongeBob...!\nSpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus.  Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle.  I better go wait for the next one.  C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary.  Uh-oh, shoe's untied.  Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over...  and through the hole.  My balloon!  Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again!  Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me?  Uhh, uhh, yeah, I...  No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know what time the next bus comes...  Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what.  I'm gettin' hungry.  Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to Glove World!.  Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that?  A candy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm...  I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what!  I'll only be gone a second.  Hey!  Ooh!  Come on, come on!  Hey, that was mine!  Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy.  Tartar sauce!  Fish paste!  I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom. I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise!  Okay, second. I am second in line.  Okay, third is good.  Fourth, not bad.  Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it.\nWindow Attendant: Next.\nSpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving.  Tartar sauce!\nWindow Attendant: Next.  Next.  Next.

Next bus leaves in...  5 seconds.  Ohh, tough luck, kid.  That's the last one til' morning.\nSpongeBob: Oh,  no...  you don't!\nWindow Attendant: Goodnight!\nSpongeBob: Hold it, I'm not through here!  Do you hear me?  I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then, I am not leaving this spot!  Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light!  Ah, that's better.\nSpongeBob: This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey...  if I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.\nSpongeBob: Who's there?  Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking.  Running! Better start running! Running!  Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting!  Sitting, sitting. Bleeding.  Hey, who's there?  Okay, that's enough.  Don't come closer.  I'm warning you!  I'm a sponge!  Oh, it's only you.  Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem.  I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon...  has...  enough...  air...  thanks.  Hey, I get it, balloon travel. Thank...  you!\nCreature: You're welcome!\nSpongeBob: Ah, home at last.\nPatrick: Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya!\n","18a\nTexas\nSpongeBob: Good morning, Bikini Bottom!

This doesn't look like Sandy's place.\nSandy: Don't lose your barnacles, boys. Hi-yah!  There it is!\nSpongeBob: What is it?\nSandy: Can't you see? It's Texas.\nSpongeBob: Texas? What's a Texas?\nSandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.\nSpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.\nSandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later.\nSpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah!\nSandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.\nSpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy.  Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah!\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy?  Surf's up, Sandy!\nSandy: No, thanks.\nSpongeBob: Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing!\nSpongeBob: Look, Sandy, we caught one!\nSandy: Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.\nSpongeBob: We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!\nPatrick: Fly away, little critter!\nSpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong.  Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them.

So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?\nSpongeBob: Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.\nSandy: I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya.\nSandy: Huh, duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.\nSpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?\nSandy: I'm staying!\nSpongeBob: That makes me feel all wiggly.\nPatrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas?\nSandy: What did you just say?!\nPatrick: Should I start running now?\n","18b\nWalking Small\nPlankton: Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly seventeen minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the  'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.'\nTina: Do you hear something?\nPlankton: Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one--\nBilly: Mommy, look! Somebody left this toy tractor here.\nEvelyn: Put that down, Billy, that has germs on it.\nBilly: Aw, mom.\nPlankton: You'll see.  You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious. I can deny it no longer!  I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need...  SpongeBob!\nSpongeBob: Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!\nPlankton: Yes. He's the one.\nSpongeBob: I'll have one...\nMonroe: Two, please.  Thanks.\nSpongeBob: One, please.\nEel: Excuse me.\nSpongeBob: One, please.\nLou: Sorry, kid. We're all out.\nSpongeBob: Aww, barnacles.  Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?\nPlankton: Oh, hi, SpongeBob.  I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one!  I don't know what to do with the other one!\nSpongeBob: I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.\nPlankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?\nSpongeBob: Sure!\nPlankton: SpongeBob?  SpongeBob?  SPONGEBOB!\nSpongeBob: Yeah?\nPlankton: Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance.  You can have anything you want with a little training.\nSpongeBob: Training?\nPlankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.\nSpongeBob: Assertive, huh?\nPlankton: That's right.\nSpongeBob: Anything I want.  Sounds great!\nPlankton: Wonderful.  SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!\nSpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.\nPlankton: No, no, be assertive!\nSpongeBob: Beep Beep!\nPlankton: Not in-sertive!  SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!\nSpongeBob: But I'm a spo...\nPlankton: Don't say it!  There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?\nSpongeBob: Ice cream!\nPlankton: Listen, you! My friend's got something to say!\nEel: What, who said that?  Was it you?\nPlankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!\nSpongeBob: That's my ice cream cone!\nPlankton: Great! Now let him have it!\nSpongeBob: You can have it.\nEel: Say, thanks!\nPlankton: No!  I'll show ya how!  Hey, pencil neck!  Yeah, you. Slither over here!  Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery!\nSpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!\nPlankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!\nSpongeBob: Yeah!\nPlankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.\nPlankton: Whatever.\nSpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it!  I found something!\nScooter Like Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours?\nSpongeBob: Sure!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!\nSpongeBob: Do you want to take a hike with me?\nScooter Like Fish: Yeah.\nPlankton: Now, look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!\nSpongeBob: Hey, go check in that ditch!\nScooter Like Fish: Wow, buried treasure! Thanks!\nSpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!\nSpongeBob: Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!\nFish: But I'm wearing sandals!\nSpongeBob: Okay, never mind!  It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?\nPlankton: Oh, nothing, SpongeBob.  I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.\nSpongeBob: No it's not!\nPlankton: Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.\nSpongeBob: But what about airline food?\nPlankton: What?\nSpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night!  See, I can be a stand-up guy. See?\nPlankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!\nSpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!\nPlankton: Okay, but this is your last chance!  Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?\nSpongeBob: Just watch me!  Man, this thing is sandy!\nFred: My leg!\nPlankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach!  SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?\nSpongeBob: Well, not all of me.\nHot Dog Man: Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\nPlankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!\nSpongeBob: I'll do better than that!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!\nSpongeBob: What?\nPlankton: Breaking your wind!\nLarry: Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball.\nSpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male!  Plankton?  Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!\nPlankton: Exactly.\nSpongeBob: You didn't tell me everyone would leave.\nPlankton: Oops.\nSpongeBob: Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development!  That wasn't nice!\nPlankton: Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world!\nSpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?\nPlankton: Huh? What are you doing?  Wait, SpongeBob! Stop!  Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting!\nSpongeBob: What happened?\nScooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!\nSpongeBob: No problem!\nScooter: Whoa!  Killer!\nPlankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back!  Wait!\nScooter: Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!\nSpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.\nPlankton: Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting!  Need hatred.\nSpongeBob: Volleyball, anyone?  Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch!\n","19a\nFools in April\nSpongeBob: Wake up, Gary.\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: We're moving today!\nGary: Meow?\nSpongeBob: That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: No more food.  Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells.  April Fools!  There ya go, pal!\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: Whew, I'm thirsty!   This is an extreme thirst!\nSpongeBob: Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools!  To me!\nSquidward: What's he so happy about?  April 1st?  April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday!  Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible.\nMr. Krabs: What'd you catch?\nSquidward: I caught sight of the calendar.\nMr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.\nSquidward: I have arrived.  What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?\nMr. Krabs: You just missed him.\nSpongeBob: Yeah, but he told us to tell you...\nSquidward: Tell me what?\nSpongeBob: He told me to tell you... April Fools.\nSquidward: Well, it's been nice working here.  Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.\nSpongeBob: Squidward, wait!\nSquidward: Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!\nSpongeBob: Wait, Squidward!  It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!\nSquidward: You do?\nSpongeBob: Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?\nSquidward: Well, as long as it's not me.\nCora: Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?\nSpongeBob: They're right here, lady!\nCora: But this is a spoon.\nSpongeBob: April Fools!  Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?\nNat: Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.\nSpongeBob: Hey, what's that?\nNat: Well, I didn't see anything.  Hey, where'd that other guy go?\nSpongeBob: April Fools! I'm right here!\nNat: Hey, that was pretty good.\nSquidward: What are you doing behind the counter?\nTom: Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?\nSpongeBob: Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up!  Here you go.\nTom: Thanks.  Huh?  Huh?  Ah.\nSpongeBob: April Fools!\nTom: What did you do to my drink?!\nSpongeBob: I...  I...\nTom: You what?!?!\nSpongeBob: You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one!\nTom: I guess that is pretty funny.\nSpongeBob: Hey, your shoes untied.  April Fools! You're not wearing shoes!  April Fools!\nSquidward: That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about!\nSpongeBob: Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up!\nSquidward: April Fools!\nSpongeBob: Whooaahh!  Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl...\nCustomers: Oh, no!\nSpongeBob: Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nSquidward: I'll catch you, SpongeBob!  Oops.  April Fools, you little sausage!  SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding\u2026 Right?\nMartin: Aww, man, poor kid.\nShubie: That guy has definitely got some issues to work out.\nTom: April Fools... jerk.\nSquidward: Wait, don't go!\nMan: Hey, you stink!\nSquidward: Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh...  Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach.  Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo-  gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought.  SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob?  Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh\u2026 and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of\u2026 This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am...  Patrick? What are you doing here?\nPatrick: Digging.\nSquidward: Why are you wearing that hat?\nPatrick: Hmm, I don't know.\nSquidward: Where's SpongeBob?\nPatrick: He's in the house. He's impressed.\nSquidward: With what?\nPatrick: I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there!  SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this!\nSpongeBob: What do you want?\nSquidward: SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy.\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: I'm trying to say I'm  hee-haw-hee-haw!\nSpongeBob: What?\nSquidward: I'm just trying to say that I'm...  There's gotta be an easier way to do this.  Well, aren't you going to open it?\nSpongeBob: I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.\nSquidward: Doh!  SpongeBob, I'm...  SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am...  ...sorry.  There you go.\nSpongeBob: But I couldn't...\nSquidward: I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear!\nPatrick: It must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.\nTom: April Fools... jerk.\nMama Tentacles: You stink!\nSquidward: Mother?  All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and...\nSpongeBob: Squidward! Is all that true?\nSquidward: Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.\nSpongeBob: Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?\nSquidward: What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.\nSpongeBob: I promise.\nSquidward: Really?\nEveryone: April Fools!\nSquidward: April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all!\nSpongeBob: What would we do without Squidward?\n","19b\nNeptune's Spatula\nSpongeBob: Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula!\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here.  Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed.\nSpongeBob: Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...\nSpongeBob and Patrick: ...the golden spatula. Wow!\nSpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula!  Okay, I'm ready!\nMiss Shell: Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is?\nPatrick: Uhh!\nSpongeBob: Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way.  Uh-oh.\nMiss Shell: Holy smokes!\nPatrick: Rude. Hey, the light changed.\nSpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick...\nPatrick: Hold on, almost there.\nKing Neptune: Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?\nSpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.\nKing Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge.  Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny!  Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook.  No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no...  Ah!\nSpongeBob: But, but...\nKing Neptune: A purveyor of foods.  Yes, you must be my new fry cook.\nHot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.\nKing Neptune: Then who pulled out the spatula?\nHot Dog Vendor: Uh, he did.\nKing Neptune: It is even funnier a second time!  You there, crustacean!\nLarry: Who, me?\nKing Neptune: You have the physique of Atlas!\nLarry: Thanks, I work out.\nKing Neptune: Make poses with me!\nLarry: Okay!\nLarry and King Neptune: Body slam!\nKing Neptune: You pulled the spatula from the grease!\nLarry: Nope, that was SpongeBob.\nKing Neptune: This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook?  Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate!  What? Am I expected to believe this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof?  Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.\nSpongeBob: Like?\nKing Neptune: The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.\nSpongeBob: Actually, I've got two.\nKing Neptune: Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear.  No, blue.  Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains...  His big toes are...  Uhh, he has six...\nPatrick: He is the new royal fry cook and you...\nKing Neptune: Silence!\nPatrick: Is it hot in here or what?\nSpongeBob: Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!\nKing Neptune: So, little one, you think you have what it takes to become my royal fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!\nPatrick:  Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any...  Ouch.\nKing Neptune: Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.\nPatrick: Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob?\nKing Neptune: Three challenges!\nPatrick: Three?   Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges!\nKing Neptune: Enough!\nPatrick: He'll settle for one.\nKing Neptune: There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!\nSpongeBob: I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.\nKing Neptune: Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him.\nPatrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?!  SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!\nSpongeBob: How you feeling?\nPatrick: Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?\nKing Neptune: And now, see the fate that may lie ahead.  For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great.  Behold!  Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold!  My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!\nPatrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.\nKing Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?\nSpongeBob: I'm ready.\nKing Neptune: Very well then. To the Poseidome!\nMr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off!  All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.\nSpongeBob: May the best man win.\nMr. Krabs: Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking!  Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you.  Put it all on Neptune!\nSpongeBob: I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.\nPatrick: Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: \"Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds.\" Well, just look at me now.  Go get 'em, tiger!\nSpongeBob: Once upon a time...\nSpongeBob: Perfect!\nKing Neptune: I win!  Loser!  Free patties for everyone!  Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious!  Ooh.\nAudience: You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!\nKing Neptune: Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better?  Give me that!  Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time!\nSpongeBob: So, uhh, what do you think?\nKing Neptune: Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Yeah!  We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis!\nSpongeBob: What's so funny?\nKing Neptune: You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?\nSpongeBob: You mean, Patrick can't come?\nKing Neptune: No, of course not.\nSpongeBob: And my friends?\nKing Neptune: Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.\nPatrick: It was nice knowing you, buddy!\nSpongeBob: I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.\nMr. Krabs: I lost me bet!\nKing Neptune: Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart...  to Atlantis!\nSpongeBob: I... I...  I don't wanna go!\nKing Neptune: It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it!  Maybe we do have a problem.\nSpongeBob: Wait, Neptune! I have another idea!\nPatrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.\nSpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. What'll you have?  Can you excuse me?\nKing Neptune: The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove!  Haha!\nSpongeBob: What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?\nKing Neptune: Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic.\n","20a\nHooky\nNarrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends.\nSquidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?\nSpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine.\nMr. Krabs: They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes!  The hooks! The hooks!\nFred: How about a mint?\nMr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!\nTom: Can you make that to go?\nSquidward: You don't know how lucky you are.\nMr. Krabs: The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business...\nSquidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection.  Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.\nMr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya.\nSpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?\nMr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.\nSpongeBob: The hooks?\nMr. Krabs: Aye.  The hooks.  They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches...  ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher  until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse...\nSpongeBob: What could be worse than that?\nMr. Krabs: Gift shops.\nSpongeBob: Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.\nSpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs.\nPatrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.\nSpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.\nPatrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go.\nSpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.\nPatrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break.  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni...  We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town.  I'm gonna be first in line for everything!\nSpongeBob: Where is everybody?\nPatrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier.\nSpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever...  Excuse me.  Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!\nPatrick: Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!\nSpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!\nPatrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it.\nSpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs said...\nPatrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something.  Does this look dangerous?\nSpongeBob: Patrick, don't!\nPatrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel...\nSpongeBob: Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend.  Patrick, you're alive.\nPatrick: Am I ever. You should try it.\nSpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?\nPatrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.\nSpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.\nPatrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey?\nSpongeBob: Well, no.\nPatrick: Wheeee.\nSpongeBob: I guess he didn't.\nPatrick: Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away!\nSpongeBob: Ready?\nPatrick: Ready.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: Geronimo!\nSpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab.\nIvy: P.U.,  you call this food?!\nHarold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!\nAnother Harold: My sandwich IS a fried boot!\nFred: Hurry it up, will ya? We're hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it.\nSquidward: Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!\nMr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?\nSquidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break.  What?\nMr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taking a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59.  Now, what were you saying?\nSquidward: He took a break.\nMr. Krabs: Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues.  Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.\nSquidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help!\nMr. Krabs: They should be right here.\nPatrick: Again?\nSpongeBob: Again!\nMr. Krabs: The hooks! No! No! No!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: 1, 2, 3...\nMr. Krabs : Wait! Wait!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: ...blastoff.\nMr. Krabs: Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone!  If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd...  ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!\nSpongeBob: I...I...I...\nPatrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.\nMr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?\nSpongeBob: Gift shop?\nMr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna.  With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.\nSpongeBob & Patrick: We promise, Mr. Krabs.\nMr. Krabs: I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.\nMr. Krabs: Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!\nSpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck.\nMr. Krabs: Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap.\nSpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.\nGary: Meow.\nSpongeBob: I'm ready!  I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready.\nPatrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way.\nSpongeBob: I always go to work this way.\nPatrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!\nSpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.\nPatrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.\nSpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.\nPatrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.\nSpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...\nPatrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?\nSpongeBob: Umm...\nPatrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun.  Come on, SpongeBob. You know you want to!\nSpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another...  ...hook!  Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never!  Is this seat taken?  Whew! Glad I got that out of my system.  I'm...hooked! And that means...  Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!\nMr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl.

Ooh!\nBarnacle Boy: Uh, Mermaid Man?\nMermaid Man: Yes, Barnacle Boy?\nBarnacle Boy: We're not in the Invisible Boatmobile, are we?\nMermaid Man: Uh, Nope.\nBarnacle Boy: I told you making the boatmobile invisible was a stupid idea.\nMermaid Man: Boatmobile!

Help! Help somebody here.\nSpongeBob: You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder.\nMermaid Man: Stop, kid. Stop! Let him go.\nSpongeBob: But you said he could snap...  ...just like that.\nAtomic Flounder: What?! Get off of me!  If I weren't retired, I'd, I'd...  ...do that.  Out of my way, punk!\nSpongeBob: I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day.
