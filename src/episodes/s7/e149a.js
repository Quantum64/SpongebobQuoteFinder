You Don't Know Sponge
Squidward: Can you two be quiet?!
Squidward: Didn't think so. What are you barnacle heads doing, anyway?
SpongeBob: Patrick and I are practicing our favorite noises. Mine is a dolphin, laughing.
Patrick: And my favorite is the plaintiff song of the blue whale. Ahem.
Whale Businessman: Huh? Did you hear that?
Fish Businessman: What's wrong, Frank?
Frank: That song. It sounds just like... Martha!
Fish Businessman: Frank, how many times do I have to tell you? Martha's no good for you! She's just no good!
Squidward: Why would you want to practice such horrible sounds?
SpongeBob: It's one of the activities in our favorite magazine.  Simple-Ton: A ton of simple things to do!
Squidward: It must very challenging for you!
SpongeBob: Oh, it is.
Patrick: Yeah, and it made me look more smart-like.  What does the magazine say we should do next?
SpongeBob: Well, let's take a look.  We've done everything in this issue. Oh, except for this one! The Best Friend Quiz! Do you really know your best friend? Oh, this should be easy. Patrick and I know everything about each other!
Squidward: Well, you two have fun with your mutual ignominious society.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Bye, Squidward!
Squidward: Morons.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Bye, again!
SpongeBob: You go first, Patrick.
Patrick: Oh, no. After you, old buddy.
SpongeBob: Au contraire. After you, mon amie.
Patrick: Please. After you, pal.
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. After you, bestest friend-  -Oof!
Squidward: Just pick one! And there's another three where that came from!
SpongeBob: I'll go first.  Question 1: What is your best friend's favorite color? Hmmm.... I'm thinking........Aquamarine!
Patrick: I hate to burst your bubble, but my favorite color is........ it is aquamarine. Sorry I doubted you.
SpongeBob: No problem. Is your best friend right, or left-handed? The answer is right-handed.
Patrick: How did you know?
SpongeBob: Simple, Patrick! It's because you're my best friend!
Patrick: Aww!
SpongeBob: Is your best friend's belly button have an innie or an outie?
Patrick: No peeking!
SpongeBob: No need to peek, Patrick. I can do this with my eyes closed!  You haaaaaaaaaave...
Patrick: Oh! What will his answer be?
Squidward: The suspense is killing me!
SpongeBob: ...an innie!
Patrick: Well, let's just check that theory!  Innie!  Wow! How does he do it?
Squidward: Magic.
Patrick: My turn! But, give me some hard questions. Not like those softballs you answered.
SpongeBob: Okay! First question: What is your best friend's favorite color?
Patrick: Aw, man! Pulled out the big guns. Color. Color.
Patrick: No, no! No hints!  Blue! No, clear! No!  That's not it. Hold on, hold on. 14.
SpongeBob: The answer is...beige.
Patrick: Oh, barnacles! Oh, I was so close.
SpongeBob: Question 2: Is your best friend left-handed or right-handed?
Patrick: Oh, tricky, tricky. Hmm, right, or, left? Right-handed!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick, I'm ambidextrous!
Patrick: Oh, fish paste!
SpongeBob: Next question: Does your best friend have an innie, or an outie belly button?
Patrick: Belly button, huh? Hmm. An innie!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. I have an outie.
Patrick: Tartar sauce!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm sure you'll get the next one right! What is your best friend's favorite food?
Patrick: Uh...
Patrick: Oh! Oh! I remember! Your favorite food is a chum burger!
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: I thought for sure I had that one.
SpongeBob: Okay, let's try an easy one. Is your best friend a boy or a girl?
Patrick: Ooh. That's a toughie.  Hmm. Rugged biceps.  Yet, delicate eyelashes. Pass!
SpongeBob: Uh, last question!
Patrick: Ooh! This is for the win!
SpongeBob: What shape is your best friend?
Patrick: Oh! I got this one! Um, uh, can you repeat the question?
SpongeBob: What shape is your best friend, SpongeBob SQUAREPANTS?
Patrick: Round, flat, uh, hexagon.
SpongeBob: SQUARE-pants.
Patrick: Ooh! It's right on the tip of my tongue!
SpongeBob: Five seconds.
Patrick: Um, um, oh, jeez, trapezoid, pentagon, mormorphis...
SpongeBob: Time's up!
Patrick: Triangle!
SpongeBob: Uh, no.
Squidward: Idiots, wrecking my boat.
Squidward: So, who won your stupid quiz?
Patrick: It was a tie.
Squidward: Let me see that.  a triangle?! Patrick didn't know anything about you!  And he's supposed to be your best friend?
Patrick: I know, it's like we're not friends at all!
SpongeBob: Now, now. Patrick may not have passed the quiz, but like a true best friend, he's always here for me. Right, Patrick?  Patrick?
Patrick: Ice cream!
Squidward: Looks like your best friend isn't a friend at all!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! I got you an ice cream.
SpongeBob: Thank you, best friend, Patrick.
Patrick: It's your favorite! Dill Pickle Swirl with mustard and extra bacon bits!
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is your favorite ice cream. My favorite is, plain vanilla.
Patrick: Oh, right.  Well, more ice cream for me!
Patrick: Oh, can I borrow five bucks?
SpongeBob: Here! Take your dirty, rotten money!  Ahhah! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE!
Ice Cream Man: Hey, what's with him?
Patrick: I guess he didn't want any ice cream.
Gary: Meow-row.  Meow-row-row...
SpongeBob: It just isn't fair!  Oh, who needs Patrick anyway?  Rest of my life, here I come!
Patrick: Oh, hey there, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Be strong, be strong, be strong, be strong! Good afternoon, Mr. Star.
Patrick: See you later!
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy! It was awful! Truly awful! We were like complete strangers!
Sandy: You don't need to know everything about your best friend. That's what keeps the friendship interesting!
SpongeBob: Really?
Sandy: Maybe you and Patrick just need some time apart.
SpongeBob: Yeah! I'll have lots of fun without Patrick!
Sandy: What a crybaby.
SpongeBob: I don't need Patrick! I can have a good time all by myself!  I can go jellyfishing!  Patrick and I used to go jellyfishing...I can play leapfrog!  I can blow bubbles!  Uh, maybe not.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's Patrick! I can't let him see me!  Well, he doesn't seem to be missing me at all.  Nice that he's gotten over our friendship so quickly!
SpongeBob: Patrick works out at the gym?  And he's hanging out with Larry the Lobster? Maybe I don't know much about Patrick, either.
SpongeBob: Patrick's shopping for cookery? Very suspicious. Oh! He's coming back!
SpongeBob: Hold it right there, Patrick!
Larry the Lobster: Hi, SpongeBob.
Patrick: We were just coming to see you.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'll bet you were... to tell me about your new best friend, Larry, I suppose?!
Larry: Whoa, settle down, little dude. I don't want to get in the middle of, whatever this is.
Patrick: While Larry is a great guy, loads of talent, and good looks.
SpongeBob: I know, he is pretty amazing...
Patrick: He's not my best friend. He was just helping me buy a present.
SpongeBob: Who for? Sandy?
Patrick: No. For my REAL best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants.
SpongeBob: Really?  For me? What is it?  Oh! I love it! You DO know me, best friend!
Patrick: I got a pair for me too!
SpongeBob: Oh, you're the bestest, best friend Patrick!  How do I look?
Patrick: How should I know, mysterious stranger?!
