Squidward: Stop playing... in my yard!
SpongeBob: Oh, we're not playing in your yard, Squidward, we're playing in our yards. We're just using your yard as a walkway.
Patrick: No offense, but your yard gargles tartar sauce.
Squidward: Well, pick one, and leave my yard out of it!
Patrick: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I'm good at choosing! Hmmmm... let's play innnn... SpongeBob's yard! No! Patrick's! Errrr... SpongeBob!  I'm terrible at choosing! Squidward! You choose!
Squidward: I choose Patrick...  to play in Patrick's yard...  and SpongeBob in SpongeBob's yard. And nobody...  in here!

Patrick: Squidward's house wants to play too!
Squidward: My house!
SpongeBob: Awww. Squidward's house looks like it has an upset tummy.
Patrick: Must've been something it ate.
SpongeBob: It ate Squidward!
Patrick: That'll do it
Squidward: I knew you two reprobates were behind this.
SpongeBob: Yeah! We're reprobates!
Squidward: That was an insult.
Patrick: And we're insulted!
Squidward: Why were you digging under my yard?
SpongeBob: You told us not to walk on your yard, so, we walked under it.
Squidward: But you buried my house!
Patrick: No need to thank us.
Squidward: Thank you?!

SpongeBob: Hi, Squidward
SpongeBob: Yuh oh!
Squidward: I'm warning you: If you don't put my house back where it belongs by the count of th-ree-  Three. I am going to grind you into chum! One!
Patrick: He's counting, anything but counting! Quick, SpongeBob! Dig for your life!
Squidward: Two!
Patrick: He's already at number two! Who knows how many numbers we have until he reaches three?
Squidward: Th-ree!
Plankton: Yes! Now the Chum Bucket is the only restaurant in town!  Nuts.
