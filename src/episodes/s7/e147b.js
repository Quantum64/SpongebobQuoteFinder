Shellback Shenanigans
SpongeBob: Good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Closing time already?
SpongeBob: I just served a Krabby Patty to the last customer.
Mr. Krabs: Well, have a good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, is it okay if I buy a Krabby Patty to go for my pet snail Gary?
Mr. Krabs: I thought those things ate mostly kibble.
SpongeBob: It's a special treat. Just to get him ready for tomorrow...
Mr. Krabs: Oh! Right! Okay, that makes- Wait, what's tomorrow?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, did you forget?
Mr. Krabs: Probably.
SpongeBob: Tomorrow is "Bring Your Pet To Work" day!
Mr. Krabs: I don't need a special day for that. Squidward's here every day!
Squidward: Nice.  REAL NICE!
SpongeBob: Umm... Can I buy that patty?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. Sure.
SpongeBob: Alright! Gary's gonna be so excited!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob! I almost forgot. The price is double for pets because they're so special.
SpongeBob: Good idea!  Thanks again, Mr. Krabs!  Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa, what?
Mr. Krabs: What, what?!
SpongeBob: We're all out of Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: Did you check the freezer?!
SpongeBob: I checked the freezer, the spare freezer, the back-up freezer, the extra freezer, the rear freezer, the micro freezer, and the freezer under the stairs!
Mr. Krabs: What about the freezer in the attic?
SpongeBob: We don't have an attic.
Mr. Krabs: No attic?!
SpongeBob: You sold it, remember?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah.
Plankton: Now what are they saying Karen? Karen?!
Karen: I have no idea.
Plankton: What? I thought you said you could read lips!
Karen: I can, but you took my telescope away!
Mr. Krabs: Well, that settles it, SpongeBob. We're just gonna have to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
SpongeBob: A fresh batch?
Mr. Krabs: That's what I said. A fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Plankton: Okay, now what's he saying?
Karen: He said they're going to make a fresh batch of Krabby Patties.
Plankton: A fresh batch of—ooh, this is good. This is really good!
SpongeBob: When are we making this fresh batch of Krabby Patties, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: What?
Plankton: Okay, what'd he just say?
Karen: What?
Plankton: I said, "What'd he just say?"
Karen: He said, "What?"
Plankton: I have no idea, that's why I'm asking you what he just said!
Karen: I know that, and I'm saying he said, "What?"!
Plankton: I know that! Wait... oh, he said, "What?".
Karen: Yes!
SpongeBob: Wow, a whole new fresh batch of Krabby Patties! Gary's gonna go crazy!
Mr. Krabs: You know, SpongeBob, heh, might not be such a good idea bringing a dirty snail into the kitchen. I think we might just want to reschedule "Bring Your Pet To Work" day.
SpongeBob: No! Mr. Krabs, I promise that Gary will be sparkly clean. I'll give him an extra long bath tonight!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, okay. But make sure he's healthy and clean!
Plankton: Healthy and Clean, Fresh Batch of Krabby Patties? Ooh, I think I smell a plan!
SpongeBob: Gary! I brought you a delicious treat!
Gary: Mow.
SpongeBob: There you are, Gare-bear. I brought you some kelp fries.  I was going to bring you a Krabby Patty, but we ran out! I'll go get your bath ready, while you enjoy them.  Gary! Your bath is ready! Gary? Gary?  Gary?  Gary?!  Gary, not again come out of there, it's dirty!  Gotcha! Come on, Gary, quit messing arou....
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Great, Gary, just great! Now you need an extra, extra, extra, extra long bath! You're not going to come down from there, are you?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Ugh! You win, we'll bathe you in the morning!
Plankton: Good morning, sir! My name is Sheldon R. Shellcleaner, owner and operator of Super Shell Cleaner Vacations Unlimited. Can I ask you a question? Are you tired of your dirty shell resulting in tireless hours of...
SpongeBob: Gary! I'm going to start the bath!
Plankton: Look I'll just cut to the chase. Do you have a dirty shell and hate bath time?
Gary: Meow.
Plankton: Of course you do! That's why I must tell you about our limited time offer. For not 4, not 3, but 1 luxurious night here! At Club Shell! A perfect resort for snails. Don't try to pinch yourself this could be...
SpongeBob: Gary! The bath is ready!
Plankton: ...all yours! Now I know what your thinking, but I got you covered!  A temporary shell will be provided for you to wear while yours is being cleaned, and all of this is free of charge of course.
SpongeBob: Gary! Your bath is ready!
Plankton: Have a pleasant stay! Bon Voyage!  If my reasoning is correct, as SpongeBob's pet, I'll get to witness Krabby Patties being made from scratch! Then I can copy the formula, and destroy Krabs once and for all!
SpongeBob: Ah-ha there you are Gare-Bear!  Oh, you naughty little snail hiding from me! I'm gonna give you a real good scrubbing. You have to be sparkly clean for "Bring your pet to work” day! And today is the day!  First, I'm gonna start you off with a yummy smelling shower gel!
Plankton: Wha...?
SpongeBob: Ahhh, smells nice, doesn't it?
Plankton: Ugh...
SpongeBob: Prepare yourself for the scrubbing of a lifetime!
SpongeBob: Bet that feel good, huh?
Plankton: Curses! I mean... meow?
SpongeBob: Gary, are you sure you're feeling alright?
Plankton: I've never felt better! Uh, I mean... meow!
SpongeBob: Gary! You're turning green! And talking!
Plankton: No, I'm not.
SpongeBob: We gotta get you to the pet hospital!
Plankton: Pet hospital! But what about the fresh batch of Krabby Patties?! I mean, meow!
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary! I'll call Mr. Krabs and tell him I'm gonna be late! Gary, you're a lot more talkative when you're sick.  Excuse me, nurse. My snail has been talking and he's turning green. Is he sick?
Plankton: Meow?
SpongeBob: Is that yes? Or no?
Sadie: I have never seen such a drastic case! Rush this snail to the intensive care unit stat!
Plankton: Intensive care unit?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary. These are proffesionals.
Plankton: Karen! Oh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
Sadie: Don't worry. I'm just going to subject you to a series of invasive tests. It'll be over before you know it.
Jennifer-Millie: Sir, all the doctor is saying is that your snail is still in the intensive care unit and we just need to run a couple more tests.
Purple Doctorfish: That's not what I'm saying at all.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary!
Purple Doctorfish: Yes, I'll be honest with you, son, we've tried everything we can, we just can't find out anything wrong with him! I've never seen anything like it.
SpongeBob: Please try to save him, doctor!
Plankton: No! No more! Please! I-I-I-I...
Sadie: Relax, Gary, the tests are over. I'm just here to give you a little pill.
Plankton: Whew! That's a relief.
Sadie: Open wide.
Sadie: That wasn't so bad, was it?  That's not good...  Uh, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: Gary!
Sadie: The doctor says there's nothing more we can do. It's best to take him home and let nature take its course.
SpongeBob: You're- you're saying that he's... that he might... oh...  Nurse? Nurse?! Oh, well, Gary, this looks like it might be...... the end.
Plankton: If I could just have a...  Krabby Patty before I go...
SpongeBob: Sure thing, little buddy, sure.  Y'know, it's really poignant.
Plankton: What is?
SpongeBob: Well, now that you can talk, we're... we're running out of time to say I love you!
Plankton: Oh, boy...
Bubbles change the scene to the bus Gary is on
Tourist: So, once again, we'd like to thank you for choosing Club Shell, and we hope to see you again, real soon.
SpongeBob: Just a little further, Gare-Bare.
Plankton: Yes!
SpongeBob: Buddy, you just stay right here, and daddy's gonna go get the secret formula and whip you up the best batch that we ever whipped up. Be right back, Gary...
Plankton: Yes, SpongeFool, come right back with your complete undoing and victory will be mine!
Plankton: Mommy?
Mr. Krabs: Plankton?
Plankton: Good day, sir. I'm just here to sample some of your delicious Krabby fare.  Whoa, there, fido!  I'm going! I'm going already!
SpongeBob: Wow, Mr. Krabs, Gary's doing a great job as bouncer. He's really earning his pay!
Mr. Krabs: Well, he takes after you, lad.  Pay?!
