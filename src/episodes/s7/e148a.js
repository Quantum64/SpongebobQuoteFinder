The Masterpiece
Mr. Krabs: It's comin' up on that time again. Okay, boy, fire her up.
SpongeBob: With pleasure, Mr. Krabs.  I love this part of the job.
Mr. Krabs: Don't forget the cheese.
SpongeBob: And this part ain't bad either!
Mr. Krabs: Looks good, kiddo. You want to do the honors?
SpongeBob: You don't mean...
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I mean.
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Krabs. Thank you. It is both an honor and a privilege that I shall---
Mr. Krabs: What are you going on about? I let you turn the sign every day.
SpongeBob: As I don the ceremonial white gloves, I can continue the eternal cycle and now deem the Krusty Krab...open.  Patrons, spring forth.  The Krusty Krab will now seat you.
Mr. Krabs: All right, you landlubbers, get the lead--  Neptune's jewels! Where are all me costumers? And just when the Krabby Patty was about to go triple platinum. Squidward. Squidward? Squidward!
SpongeBob: No need to shout Mr. Krabs, he's right here, secretly watching his favorite soap, "As The Tide Turns."
Squidward: Shut it, SpongeBob. Gil is about to reveal his secret.
Gill: You understand? Them guppies — them's my children.
Squidward: I knew it!
Mr. Krabs: In case you two haven't noticed, we got no customers! And we're not gonna get 'em back if you two lazy Susans sit around the TV all day.
Sea Chicken: Cock-a-doodle-yum!  Rise and shine! We're the best restaurant in the sea!
Mr. Krabs: Who dares lay claim to the title best restaurant in the sea?
Sea Chicken: The Sea Chicken Shack!
Announcer: Say, Mr. Sea Chicken, how's the flavor of that zesty sea chicken sandwich?
Sea Chicken: It's im-peck-able!  So come on down to my Sea Chicken Shack, and don't forget the kids.
Mr. Krabs: Blimey, this is the first I've heard of this Mr. Sea Chicken. There goes me monopoly. But how did he lure away me loyal customers away so fast? SpongeBob, I need you to head over to the Sea Chicken Shack and see what's cookin'.
SpongeBob: You want me to go undercover?
Mr. Krabs: Uh, that won't be necessary, boy. Just look around, see how he's roping in all these customers.
SpongeBob: Understood, Mr. Krabs.  How do you like my new armpit spy cam, huh? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, I don't need a spy.
SpongeBob: Oh, and check this out—a special spy pen! Looks just like a regular pen, right? See? See? See? See? See? See? Just a pen, right? See?
Mr. Krabs: Right.
SpongeBob: Well, you'd be mistaken, sir, because this pen is also...a pencil. Hmm? Pretty sweet undercover spy stuff, huh, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Boy, stop this nonsense!
SpongeBob: You're right, sir. Who needs a spy pen when you are a master in the undercover arts? I blend in with the common man. Then, like a whisper, I am gone.  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red. Come in, Big Red.
Mr. Krabs: Just tell me what you see, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: I am inside. I repeat, I am inside. Nothing of interest to report so far. In fact, it's kind of dumpy. And customer safety... a little lax.  And it smells in here like a tuna bathed in algae after running a marathon.
Charlie: Oh, so it's a crime now to exercise.
Mr. Krabs: What about the food?
SpongeBob: I have infiltrated the line right now, and I'll report back once I obtained sample.
Cashier: Next.
SpongeBob: One of your finest sandwiches, please.
Cashier: I'm afraid I can't do that, sir. Please refer to our policy regarding dress.
SpongeBob: "Headbands equal no service." Barnacles! My disguise's only weakness-  Whoa! Mayday, Big Red. Contact has not been established. Mission abort. Mission abort!  Yellow Scrubber to Big Red, I was not able to obtain any intel.
Mr. Krabs: Cut the spy lingo and just tell me, is there anything remarkable about the Sea Chicken Shack?
SpongeBob: Other than the faux dilapidation, not really.
Mr. Krabs: What you're describin' is an absolute dump. Are there any unique or interesting amenities that might attract me customers in any way?
SpongeBob: No. Great Barrier Reef!
Mr. Krabs: What is it, lad? What do you see?
SpongeBob: I see a huge statue depicting Mr. Sea Chicken and all his glory!
Mr. Krabs: A statue? How does a statue steal me customers?  SpongeBob? SpongeBob?  Of course, Mr. Sea Chicken, you mad trickster, you, cater to the kids and the parents will foll-er.  Boys, we don't have much time, so I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I need an artist, someone with a vision...
Squidward: Oh, boy.
Mr. Krabs: Someone among us with a big talent...
Squidward: He's talking about me.
Mr. Krabs: Someone to create a glorious, towering statue of my likeness. You guys know anyone around here with an artistic bone in their body?
SpongeBob: I do.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh, really? Who?
SpongeBob: Guess.
Mr. Krabs: Um, Larry the Lobster?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: Old Man Jenkins?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: One-tooth Sally?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: My mom?
SpongeBob: No.
Mr. Krabs: Then who?
Squidward: For the love of all things briny, it's me!
SpongeBob: Correct.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, that's right, Squidward. You do dabble in the doodlin' doodly-doo.
Squidward: For those who care, I am nothing short of an artistic genius.
SpongeBob: Word.
Squidward: Unfortunately, that precludes me from doing any commercial pieces. Goodbye.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, now hold on, Mr. Squidward. You and I aren't that different from each other. We both "make product."
Squidward: Are you suggesting the Krabby Patties are art?
Mr. Krabs: Yes. Squidward, do you have any idea how many people come to the Krusty Krab every day?
Squidward: Oh, I don't know, 12?
Mr. Krabs: Well, that's 12 more seeing your art than yesterday.
Squidward: All right, Krabs, I'll do it. But I will need complete artistic control.
Mr. Krabs: You got it, long as it's done by opening tomorrow.
Squidward: Yes, tom—tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs: As advertised.
Squidward: I can't make a work for the ages overnight. Art does not march to a ticking clock. Art shall come when art is good and ready, sir.
Mr. Krabs: If you want the public to experience your cultural input, get it ready by 8:00am.
Squidward: I'll need an assistant.
Mr. Krabs: Here you go.
Squidward: Fine. The first thing I need you to do, assistant, is get me a giant stone so that I may sculpt this masterpiece.
SpongeBob: Anything for the artiste.
Squidward: And don't dilly...  ...dally. Nice rock.
SpongeBob: Isn't it? I can't believe no one was using it.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna be rich!
Squidward: I'm gonna be famous!
SpongeBob: I'm gonna be Squidward's assistant giant rock fetcher!
Squidward: Prepare to be immortalized in stone.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? I'm...shy.
Squidward: I am posing you! Did you think the sculpture was going to make itself?  Don't you want the money this statue's going to bring in?
Mr. Krabs: Like this?
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Or this?
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Or this?
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Or this?
Squidward: Nope.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, come on, Squidward.
Squidward: Mm.  Hold that pose! Don't move a muscle.
Mr. Krabs: How long am I gonna have to stay like this?
Squidward: As long as it takes.
Mr. Krabs: Come on, Squidward, I'm about to give out!
Squidward: All done.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, let's see it!
Squidward: Make sure you wear sunglasses, or you may be blinded by my genius.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, yeah, just show me.
Squidward: Voila!
Mr. Krabs: What's that supposed to be?
Squidward: This is a masterpiece.
Mr. Krabs: I don't have a mouth in my stomach!
Squidward: It represents the gaping, mashing maw of consumerism and the endless cavern it creates within us all. I call it Mopression.
Mr. Krabs: Whatever that means. But is it safe for kids to play on?
Squidward: This is art, not a swing set!
Mr. Krabs: Well, we should do a dry run before we let the general public use it. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reporting for duty, sir!
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna need you to frolic and play on this here doohickey thingy.
Squidward: It is not a doohickey, it's art!
SpongeBob: I read you loud and clear, captain. Loud and clear.  Wow, this is heavy.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! I can't let kids play on that—that—that weapon! I'm gonna get my pants sued off!
Squidward: What, you wanted a piece or art and that's what you got.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, it's a piece all right, a piece of junk!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, if I may be allowed to float an idea.
Mr. Krabs: Did you hear something?  Oh, how long do I have to stay like this?
Squidward: As long as you're wanting to sell this many patties.
SpongeBob: I think you look really good, sir. You're golden!
