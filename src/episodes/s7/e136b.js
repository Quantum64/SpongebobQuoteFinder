Summer Job
Mrs. Puff: Have a good summer vacation, I'll see you all next fall!  Well... Hopefully not all of you.
Students: Weee!
Mrs. Puff: Time to vamoose!
SpongeBob: Oh, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Where are my keys!?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff!?
Mrs. Puff: Come on!
SpongeBob: I've got something for you!  Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I gotta get out of here!  Phew! I lost him.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff?  Can I give you my note now?
Mrs. Puff: Why can't you take a hint?!
SpongeBob: Help!
Mrs. Puff: Oh dear, of course I'll help.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff!  Don't forget to read the note!
Mrs. Puff: Why won't he just let-  Oh no! Not again! If my parole officer finds out, I don't stand a chance! I'll be sentenced for life this time!
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm... Quite a conundrum you have here. It would be a cryin' shame to a certain someone if this information were to leak out to the authorities.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, please, don't tell the police, I'll be a dead man if I get caught! I'll do anything!
Mr. Krabs: It's gonna cost a fortune to get this fixed. Thanks to you.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious me, I don't have that kind of cash!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry! I think we can work something out.
Mrs. Puff: Huh? You mean we should go out on a date?
Mr. Krabs: Err... interesting, no, I had something else in mind. Surprise, SpongeBob! You got a new co-worker.
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff!
Mr. Krabs: She'll be filling in for Squidward while he's...  ...on vacation! Isn't that right, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: That's right.
Mr. Krabs: She'll be workin unpaid until he returns. Won't she?
Mrs. Puff: Yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! I forgot to tell ya. You're taking a summer off! Have a good time! See ya!  Phew! That was close.
SpongeBob: It all sounds a bit mysterious to me. Oh but why should I care? I'm working with good old Mrs. Puff! Say, did you get my note?
Mrs. Puff: Oh, I got your note alright.
SpongeBob: So what do you think?
Mrs. Puff: What did I think!? I think it caused me to- Let's just say, it changed my life.
Mr. Krabs: It certainly has. Now, SpongeBob, would you please show Mrs. Puff her new duties vis-a-vis with her recently changed life? 'Cause I'm sure a snail can't be bothered to do it.
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! I get to show you the ropes, Mrs. Puff! Hey, it's kind of like I'm the teacher!  I'm gonna be teaching you now.
Mrs. Puff: Patience is a virtue.
SpongeBob: Shall we start with the importance of good kitchen hygiene or the unabridged history of the patty?
Mrs. Puff: Why don't we just start with my basic duties?
SpongeBob: Eager to get behind the wheel, eh? I like it. Repeat after me, this is my register, there are many like it but this one is mine!
Mrs. Puff: There are many like it, but this one is mine.
SpongeBob: Now like a ships rudder this old register is temperamental. When you hit the total key... What are you doing?  You're not taking notes!? Always remember: Good Grades.
SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff: Always follow diligent notes!
Mrs. Puff: I know, SpongeBob. I taught you that phrase!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff, you can borrow my notepad today!  Now, where was I... Oh, yes! The total key is a bit sticky, so you're gonna have to be forceful, but not too forceful. Get it?
Mrs. Puff: Forceful, but not too forceful.
SpongeBob: You did! Diligence like this deserves a sticker!  Collect 10 and your entitled to a super sticker!  Why don't we work on our customer service with a little role playing, I'll be the customer and you show me your best and friendliest service, hmm?
Mrs. Puff: Fine...
SpongeBob: Good day, ma lady, charmed, I'm sure.
Mrs. Puff: Heh, funny costume, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Forgive me, I know not of this SpongeBob fellow. My name is Yukthomas Féyêdêmuffin and I entered your place of business in hope to pro-clearing lunch on this fine day.
Mrs. Puff: Of course, Mr. Féyêdêmuffin. What would you like to eat today?
SpongeBob: Psst, Mrs. Puff, it's me, SpongeBob, I think it will go smoother if you refer to him as "duke."
Mrs. Puff: You mean to refer to you as Duke?
Duke: Of course, how else one refer to me? I am a duke after all, now I shall fancy a meal if quite alright with you.
Mrs. Puff: Okay, duke, what will you have?
Duke: I shall have... Beans on toast please.
Mrs. Puff: All right, one beans on toast coming up!
SpongeBob: Psst, Mrs. Puff, SpongeBob again, you better inform the Duke that we don't serve beans on toast.
Mrs. Puff: This is just ridiculous! Would you simply explain my duties please?!
Mr. Krabs: What are you doing yelling at me customers? The duke here is one of me regulars, and I don't need to explain what happens when you start losing your regularity, do I?
Mrs. Puff: Oh dear... Message received, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't let it happen again, Puff.
SpongeBob: Well, I see you have a little trouble getting in gear there, but you'll be in the fast lane before you know it!  Ah! Here comes another customer! Let's see if you can apply what you learned!
Mrs. Puff: Welcome to the Krusty Krab, sir. May I take your order?
SpongeBob: Yes!
Frankie Billy: One Krabby Patty please?
Mrs. Puff: $1 please. Thank you.
SpongeBob: Good job, Mrs. Puff! Now all that's left is to submit the order to the cook.
Mrs. Puff: One Krabby Patty!
SpongeBob: Oh, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: What?
SpongeBob: It must have slipped your mind that you need to submit the order in writing as well. It's the only way to ensure maximum clarity.
Mrs. Puff: Fine! Here's your written form!
SpongeBob: One Krabby Patty. Uh, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: What now?
SpongeBob: I can't begin cooking until the bell is rung.  Thank you! Although, a smidge less rigorous next time please?  Order up! You done well so far, student! Now all that's left is to deliver the item to the customer. Be cautious, but swift. Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I were you. It's faster if you go this way, Mrs. P, look out for the barrel!
Mrs. Puff: I'll give your barr-
SpongeBob: Watch for pedestrians!  Pot hole!  Look out, Mrs. Puff!  Time for evasive action!  And the patty is unscathed! Way to go, Mrs. Puff! Your first satisfied customer! Although, I have to deduct points for that landing though.
Mrs. Puff: That's it! I don't care anymore! This isn't worth it!  I will not be humiliated any longer!
SpongeBob: Don't forget to read the note!
Mrs. Puff: YOU! It's because of you I got stuck in this mess!
Police: Hold it right there! Well, well, well, if it ain't Mrs. Puff. I saw what you did.
Mrs. Puff: I. You did?
Police: Yeah.
Mrs. Puff  Oh please! I didn't mean to do it! I swear!
Police: It's too late for swearing Puff! The evidence is right here.  You littered, now you're going to the stony lonesome.
Mrs. Puff: Littered? You're absolutely right, officer! Yes! I sure did litter! That's what I did!
Police: Yeah, all right. You're under arrest now.
Mrs. Puff: No problem, officer, time by myself in the stoney lonesome is just what I need!
Police: Tell it to the judge, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: 1 day down, 2,528 to go! That's just shy of 4 years without SpongeBob! I'm going to enjoy this!
Police: Get up, Puff! The judge says you have to go to traffic school.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, wow! A Driver's Education class! This is just how I made a living except without HIM. Delightful!
SpongeBob: Good day, class!
Mrs. Puff: I must be having a nightmare! what's he doing here?!
SpongeBob: Didn't you read the note, Mrs. Puff? Here, I taped it together and saved it just in case.  Dear Mrs. Puff, I'm following in your footsteps and got a job as a Driver's Ed teacher for the summer. ♥ SpongeBob.  Now let's open our Driver's Ed handbooks to Chapter 1.
