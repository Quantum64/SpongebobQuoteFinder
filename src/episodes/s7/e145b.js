Enchanted Tiki Dreams
Squidward: Okay, beloved sanctuary.  I'll see you after work.  And we'll have a nice, relaxing evening.  Just you and me.  That is, of course, if I can survive another day  with GratingBob ShrillPants.
Patrick: OOH!
Squidward: Hm.  Wow. Those two are just so amazingly stupid.
Squidward: Grrr!
SpongeBob: Ahh, Isn't this fun?
Patrick: Yeah! I love playing Buddy Toss!
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! See you at work!
Squidward: Grrr!
SpongeBob: Ow!
Patrick: Ow!
Squidward: Okay. I can do this. Just put them out of my mi...
SpongeBob: Ow!
French Narrator: One extremely annoying shift later...
Squidward: A nine-letter word for annoying: SpongeBob.  Ugh.  Finally. Some peace and quiet.  No more SpongeBob, Just me, myself and home sweet home.  Ahh. Nothing like a squid's good ol' chair to soothe the pains of a rough day. Just relax and contemplate some me time.  Perhaps I will dance to some soothing dance records.  Or I could dabble a little on painting!  Yup. I sure am looking forward to it.
Squidward: No, no, no!  Grrr!
SpongeBob: Something Squidward this way comes.
Squidward: Alright, you two, I am trying to have a relaxing evening. What in the world are you doing out here?!
Patrick: Trying to have a relaxing evening.
SpongeBob: We're playing flashlight tag.
Squidward: You're playing flashlight tag with an electric eel?
SpongeBob: We're using the advanced rules.
Squidward: Advanced rules?! That has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever-
Patrick: You're it.
SpongeBob: Oh, well played, Patrick!
Patrick: Shocking!
Electric Eel: How original.
Squidward: All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax in peace  and quiet. Is that too much to ask?
SpongeBob: Squidward, we're playing tag, not hide and seek, you silly!
Patrick: But we like hide and go seeks, too, if you want to play that.
Squidward: All I really want is to live in a world where I can just relax  in peace!
SpongeBob: Patrick, Squidward is really really sad...
Patrick: You're right. Let's go poke someone else.
SpongeBob: How about instead we do something extra special for him? Then he won't be sad anymore!
Patrick: Oh, I get it! It'll be like the time I was feeling impressed, and you let me eat all Gary's...Uh... I mean, feed Gary for a week.
SpongeBob: Patrick, this has to be extra special, and we should probably vow to do it.
Patrick: Vow?
SpongeBob: Yeah, vow.
Patrick: Well, how about instead of vowing, we just do it?
SpongeBob: I like it!
Squidward: Good night... lamp.  I guess having a relaxing evening meant saying up all night with power tools!  Well, it's not that late, even morons have to sleep sometime.
Squidward: I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Squidward: When I get those two, I am gonna...  All right, you two, I...
Squidward: It's, it's, it's... beautiful!  It's too good to be true! It's a mirage. I knew it.
I guess this is it.  Insanity.
Squidward: Next stop, padded room at the cephalopod home!  Just go with it, Squiddy.
Squidward: A refill, my good man! What the-  Patrick?! What are you doing here!?
Squidward: It's delicious! What is it?
Patrick: A smoothie.
Squidward: Remember, Squiddy, just go with it.
Tiki #1; Hey, fellas, look! It's Squidward!
Tiki #2; Hey, buddy, where ya been!?
Squidward: Hit it, boys!
Tikis: Welcome, to Squidward's Tiki Land! You can relax all day, like a Tiki can! Or lay out in the sun, for a Tiki tan!
Squidward: Or drink from a coconut that's full of flan!
Tikis: Here in Squidward's Tiki Land! You can play all day, in a Tiki band! Then dance all night on the Tiki Sand!
Squidward: Don't matter to me 'cause... 'cause I'm CRAZY, man!
Tikis: Here in Squidward's Tiki Land!
Squidward: Ahhhh, this is the life!
SpongeBob: It's beauuuuuuuuuutiful!
Squidward: I've never felt this happy in my life!
Squidward: My world!
Patrick: You were right, SpongeBob, we should have used glue instead of earwax.
SpongeBob: Yeah, especially considering neither of us have ears.
Squidward: You've destroyed my beautiful world!
SpongeBob: Sorry we couldn't make it last, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah, we really tried to make it last.
Squidward: Yeah, make it last,
Squidward: I know how to make it last!
Patrick: Ow!
SpongeBob: My turn! Ow!
