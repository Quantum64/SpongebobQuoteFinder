Monica: Oh, Brad.
Brad: Oh, Monica.
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is, little guy?
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: It's take Gary a walk in a park day!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Isn't this great, Gary? A whole park full of your own species.  Go ahead, have a good time.  I'll just sit down here for a sec.

Snail boss: Hey, this ain't over, runt! When I'm get through with you, the doctor won't know where to sow your lips back on... or two!  That little runt is going to get what's coming to him!
SpongeBob: Mmm-mmm seaweed noodle stew.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Bon appetit, Gary, I made it with extra love.  Well, it's not exactly what I had in mind, but knock yourself out.
SpongeBob: One, two. One, two.  Oh. There you are. That sure is a knock out dinner, eh?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Come on, Gary, it's time for beddy-bye!  Night-night, Gare-Bare.
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary!  Hmm? He's not here. Oh. Right. He's probably playing with the litter box again.  Peek-a-boo!  Hmm? Not in here either.  Gary? Where are you?  Hmph. I am gonna teach that snail how to clean up after himself.  Huh? What's this? Is this some kind of ransom note?  Holy Neptune! My pet Gary has been snailnapped by a deranged snail-lover!  Don't worry , Gare-Bare, I'll save you!
Gary: Meow?
Disgusting snail: Meeooooooooow...
Gary: Meow reow.
Snail boss: After me, fellas.
Bully snail: Hey, how come we never go to the front, guys?
Snail Boss: 'Cause bad guys don't never use the front door!
Bully snail: Well, I think that's pretty ridiculous.
Snail Boss: All right. Listen up! Any of you seen a snail come through here? About a... ye tall, a shell, couple of eyes?
Bully snail: I think you have to be more descriptive.
Snail Boss: Oh, okay, let's see here. Uh, this particular snail think it's real funny to make googly eyes on my girl.  Hey! What you was all giggling at? Theys' giggling at me! Alright, that's it! You weres' all going on my list! He's got that... you're all on the list!
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary? Where are you, buddy?  Snail slime! Looks like it could be Gary's.  Now for the true test.  Uh-huh. It is Gary's slime. I'm on the trail, Gary!
Harold: Why, hello there, little fellow. Are you a stray?  There you are. Isn't that better?
Gary: Meow reow.
Snail Boss: Meow meow meow meow?
Harold: No. No I haven't seen any stray snails nearby.
Snail Boss: He's trying to pull up the fast one, fellas.  Why don't we give him a taste of our own grand of swift justice?!
Narrator: Two hours later...
Snail Boss: Ha! That's enough, boys. I've think we've done a ferrow job.
Bully snail: Yeah. Let's go back to finding that snail.
Dan: Hey, Boss, there's one left.

Snail Boss: YAAAAH!
Dan and Bully snail: HAAAAH!
Snail Boss: AHH MOMMY! MOMMY!
Harold: You!  Come back here! You gotta help me clean this place up!  You brought this on yourself, Harold. No I didn't, Harold. Yes you did, Harold. Harold, I did not.
Mable/Monica: Come on, move it!  Get out of the road!
Bully snail: Where do you think you're going?
Bully snail: Get' em!
Gary: Meoooow.
Mary: Meooow.
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary?!
Mable/Monica: What the?  What do you think you're doing in my car? No free rides, loafer!
SpongeBob: Hold it right there! Hands off my Gary you snailnapper!
Mable/Monica: Snailnapper?  I don't want your dumb ol' snail.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. I suppose he wandered out of the house in the middle of the night just as though he can jump into your car.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Not now Gary, I'm scolding. And I suppose... Wh-wha-what?
Gary: Meow meow meow meow. Meow.
SpongeBob: You did wander out of the house on your own? But why?  Oh, I see why. Good ol' fashion to Mary!
Snail Boss: Hey! This ain't over yet, runt!

Brad: Oh, Monica.
SpongeBob: That's gotta hurt, Gary.
Gary: Meow reow.
Snail Boss: Eh. Come on, runt, I'll show you this great dumpster where we can find some seaweed noodle stew.
