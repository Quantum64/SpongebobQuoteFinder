Patrick: Takin' care a' Ma?!
SpongeBob: For the rest of our natural-born lives?!
Cletus: You know, carry her purse, give her cat massages, read her the Willy Shakespeare â€˜til she falls asleep at night. Ah, Ma just loves Iambic pentameter!
SpongeBob: Well, that all sounds like a lot of fun, but I-I have responsibilities back home at Bikini Bottom. I have a pet snail to feed and can't be late for work at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick: Yeah, and, iambic pentameter gives me a headache!
Cletus: You folks ain't goin' nowhere.
SpongeBob: Oh please, Mr. Trenchbillie, where can we-
Patrick: Oh, hey, your shoe's untied.
Cletus: What? But I ain't even wearin'- Darn it.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what was I supposed to tell them, Squidward?
Squidward: You could have told him that he could have his money back.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no I couldn't.
Squidward: Why?
Mr. Krabs: Because, I already put it in the register!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! We just escaped from an angry mob of deep sea bunkins!
Patrick: It was horrible! They were gonna make us stay forever and massage their grandma.
Mr. Krabs: So. Why ya' telling me?
SpongeBob: Because they followed us here.

Ma Angler: More! More! More! More!
Mr. Krabs: Oh yeah, that's what I like to see. She's gonna make customer of the week.
