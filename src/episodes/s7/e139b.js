The Cent of Money
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Gary. I thought you were done....  Wow. This town is sure going downhill.  Uh, Mr. Krabs. What are you doing out here?
Mr. Krabs: Well...you know...unwinding. Enjoying the free parking.   What's happening to your little critter here?
SpongeBob: I don't know, but when he does that he usually finds change.
Mr. Krabs: Change? As in legal tender?
SpongeBob: Yeah. Watch.
Mr. Krabs: Wow. Shiver me shell wax. You're like a little money detecting... Uh... You know... A sneagle.
SpongeBob: You mean snail.
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, SpongeBob. How about you bring your sneagle into work with ye?
SpongeBob: You said pets were not nothing but disease-carrying vermins that should never be brought to the workplace.
Mr. Krabs: But that was before I knew that they had such an amazing talent.
SpongeBob: But the whole process causes Gary big discomfort. I could never do it to him.
Mr. Krabs: I could.
Mr. Krabs: There you go. Bring in that change. I've been working on that one for months. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!
SpongeBob: What's so funny, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...SpongeBob. Shouldn't you be out back scrubbing the dumpster?
SpongeBob: Done and done!
Mr. Krabs: Then get back there and scrub the poop deck so to speak.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir!
Nat: Hey! What are you doing with my change?!
Mr. Krabs: Anything on the floor gains.
Sun Breathe Nazz: Hey!
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Looks like I need pockets for me pockets!  Ah. Fine! With my new money finder... Who needs ya?!  Ahh. I was about to close up shop anyways.
SpongeBob: Close up! Come on, Gare. You're coming with me.
Mr. Krabs: You aren't taking him anywhere yet. You haven't greased the fryer yet.  Don't worry about Jerry. I'll make sure he gets his nightly craw.
SpongeBob: Gary.
Mr. Krabs: Heh, heh. Excuse me mam.
Mr. Krabs: Dirty money spends just like the clean.
SpongeBob: I've finished greasing the fryer.
Mr. Krabs: You sure make easy work.
SpongeBob: Try telling that to my frizzled hands.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, but you still have work to do.
SpongeBob: I do?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah. How about you rearrange the wall rivets from smallest to largest?
SpongeBob: But aren't they the same size.
Mr. Krabs: That's what they want you to know. Now take a long look.
SpongeBob: Will do, captain.
Mr. Krabs: Now back to our treasure hunt. Eh, boy.
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: You okay, boy?
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: That a boy.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. Some of these rivets are off by as much as five nanometers. Well, I better get to work.
Mr. Krabs: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. There's no stopping. There's a laundromat that needs to be cleaned out. Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr. Cleaned out. Get it. Ahh. Never mind. MUSH!
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: If you don't get moving, I'm gonna'...
SpongeBob: You're gonna' do what, sir?
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna' give him a snaily treat.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Ohh, okay. The rivets are all rearranged.
Mr. Krabs: What!? How is that possible? Uh, now I want you to paint the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Okay. That's easy.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, uh, uh, but I want you to do it with this toothbrush.
SpongeBob: Okay. Bye, old pal.
Gary: Meow.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about Terry. He's in good claws.
SpongeBob: I'm sure he is. Bye.
Mr. Krabs: Now little sneagle. Ready to do some laundry? Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr.
Mr. Krabs: Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.
Tough guy: Hey, where's my change?
Mr. Krabs: Hee, hee, hee, hee.
Tough guy: Well, that stinks.
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr. I guess he didn't see that coming.  Hey, what's the big ide-er? We've just found a pot at the end of the rainbow. Aieeeee!
Old Man Jenkins: What the?
Mr. Krabs: It's like taking candy from a baby!
Old Man Jenkins: And that old whip shoo the coins just flew from the machine!
Security guard: Ahh, don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Mr. Krabs: Uh oh. Pronto. Time for plan B!
SpongeBob: Ah ha! That should do it!  Ahh. Time to check in with Mr. Krabs to see if he needs me to do anymore impossible jobs.
Tough guy: I'm never gonna' hear the end of this one when I get home.
SpongeBob: Pardon me sir. You haven't seen a crab walking around with a snail, have you?
Tough guy: Neptune jerks. One's a criminal used a snail to swipe the coins from me. Those steamin' crustacean used his sneagle to swipe coins from me.
SpongeBob: His sneagle?
Tough Guy: Thats right. What's the steaming might to show. Just walk right past him.
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs. What have you done to my Gary? So this is what a hotbed of sin looks like...
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr. How's it going boyo?re you feeling the coin vibes?
Gary: Pu, pu, pow.
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean you don't feel so good?
Gary: Meoow.
Mr. Krabs: You look fine to me. Now stop being such a baby and make me some money. Excuse me, pregnant lady coming through!  Uh, he he. Hoo boy. It--it's sure hard being preggers!
Security guard: Uh...yeah.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh!
Mr. Krabs: Get ready for it now, boy me boy!  Ladies and gentlemen!  Thank you for your money!  Come on Harry! Let's go. Come on you!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! For shame!
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean? I'm just showing Rory off.
SpongeBob: Don't you lie to me! I know all about you using Gary to steal money!
Mr. Krabs: I got nothing of the soul.  I would never steal. You have to quit making up stories, boy-yo.
SpongeBob: I'm not making up anything! I know all about your little scheme! You're the one making up stories!
Mr. Krabs: Don't you have work you should be doing?
SpongeBob: Oh, that's rich!
Mr. Krabs: No, if I was rich I wouldn't have to hire the likes of you!
SpongeBob: That's hurtful, Mr. Krabs, and you know it!
Mr. Krabs: Why you little yellow... Well, I never...
SpongeBob: You never what? Learned to use decent language?
Mr. Krabs: Who do you think you are!  Jackpot! Money, money, money, money. Come to papa.  Oh boy.
Purple doctorfish: Yeah he's in pretty bad shape with the impact of all that metal but he'll pull through.
SpongeBob: Doctor? How does this sort of thing happen?
Purple Doctorfish: I think this has something to do with it.
SpongeBob: Hey, my Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy fridge magnet!
Purple Doctorfish: It seems to be your pet swallowed it. It has a very strong magnetic pull.
SpongeBob: Cause' it's a magnet! That's it, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Arr, arr, arr, arr. Well, what do ya' know?
Purple Doctorfish: Unfortunately, there's still the matter of the bill.
Mr. Krabs: What? Oh, I can't afford this.
Purple Doctorfish: Actually, you've got just enough change to cover it.
Mr. Krabs: No!
