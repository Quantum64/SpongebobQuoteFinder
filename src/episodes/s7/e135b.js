The Bad Guy Club for Villains
SpongeBob: Patrick! Guess what came in the mail today!
Patrick: Oh! What?!
SpongeBob: This...
Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy lost episode! Stick it in!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Gagagaga!
Chorus: Faster than light! Prepared to stop crime! It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah!
Chorus: If you're in a jam, It's Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
Fish Head: The Adventures of Mermaid Man And Barnacle Boy! Tonight's episode: The Secret Meeting!  Deep in the Mercave, something strange takes Mermaid Man's attention!
Barnacle Boy: The Dirty Bubble? What's he doing at the bus stop?
Mermaid Man: Looks like he's got a one-way ticket to Bikini Bottom, and there's only one thing he could be up to in Bikini Bottom, Barnacle Boy!
Barnacle Boy: That's right, Mermaid Man!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Evil!
Dirty Bubble: Haherhaherherherher!
Fish Head: The Terrible Man Ray!
Dirty Bubble: Hm, so glad you could make it!
Man Ray: I wouldn't miss this for the world, Dirty! Hahahahah.
Fish Head: The most powerful of all crustaceans, it's Jumbo Shrimp! It’s the Atomic Flounder! The abomination of a nuclear experiment gone horribly wrong! And the terror of the sewers, the man eating Sinister Slug!
Dirty Bubble: We join forces at last.
Mermaid Man: It's worse than I could have imagined! A team up!
Dirty Bubble: Welcome to the BGATFBC!
Everyone: Muhahahahahahahha!
Mermaid Man: April third, 12 of noon! That's tomorrow!
Barnacle Boy: Holy...
Patrick: Hey!
SpongeBob: Hehehe! Don't worry! I can fix it!  Deeae!
Barnacle Boy: Great Guppies, Mermaid Man! We gotta do something!
Mermaid Man: Not so fast, little flipper! We are far too out-manned! But fear not. We are always one step ahead of evil!
Fish Head: Our Hero of the bride puts up a call!
Mermaid Man: To the ocean's greatest heroes!
Mermaid Man: Yeah, I can hold.
Fish Head: Meanwhile, a sinister horde congregates outside Hotel Evil!
Dirty Bubble: Right this way, gentlemen!
Jumbo Shrimp: Hey, what's going on in here?
Dirty Bubble: Huh? Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, gentlemen, you must be in the wrong room! This room is reserved for the B.G.A.T.F.B.C.
Mermaid Man: That's funny. I thought it was aside for the I.J.L.S.A.
Dirty Bubble: I.J.L.S.A? What in coral caverns is that?
All Bad Guys: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy!
Mermaid Man: That's right!  Now, before you have to say goodbye, say hello to some friends!  The Elastic Wasteband!
Barnacle Boy: Greet the hottest crime fighter in the country!  Professor Magma!
Mermaid Man: The illusive Miss Appear!  And The Pi-Right Ponderer with his hairnet of knowledge!
Pi-Right Ponderer: Do we really exist?
Mermaid Man: Together, we are The International Justice Lodge of Super Acquaintances!
Dirty Bubble: Let's get ‘em, boys!
Jumbo Shrimp: Do not tussle with the B.G.A.T.F.B.C!
Pi-Right Ponderer: Violence resolves nothing.
Man Ray: Good night, balloon boy!
Miss Appear: Professor Magma! Catch!
Barnacle Boy: Step aside, you copious cod! My beef is with the bubble!
Mermaid Man: Careful, Barnacle Boy! He's got Nuclear Touch!
Atomic Flounder: Raaaa!
Barnacle Boy: Nuclear Touch!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aaahh!
Patrick: I Can't watch!
Mermaid Man: Fracturing furniture! Hang tight, buddy!
Mermaid Man: Hang in there, my daring deputy.
FaceHand: Your daring deputy is nothing right now! But I'd be happy to pass along out the message! If he ever wakes up, that is!
Mermaid Man: Swirling Shrimp! That fiend has taken control over Barnacle Boy!
Elastic Waistband: What do we do, Mermaid Man?
Mermaid Man: I'm glad you asked!  I believe that if the Atomic Flounder were to touch that wretched growth, it would cause a chain reaction, reversing the polarity, and the molecular level, restoring Barnacle Boy to his natural state! Does that sound about right, Professor Magma?
Handface: You'll never do it! You don't have the moxie!
Mermaid Man: That's what you think, curd!  Shield!  Ha, Ha, Ha!
SpongeBob: Look out, Mermaid Man!
Sinister Slug: Grrrr!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay!
Mermaid Man: The Sinister Slug's slime has got you stationary and stiff! Which means, your time is up, Hand!
HandFace: Not Nuclear Touch!
Barnacle Boy: Great Gravy! What just happened?
Mermaid Man: I'll tell you about it later, now let's take out the trash!
Pi-Right Ponderer: Please, you can use my hairnet of knowledge.
Mermaid Man: Thank you, Ponderer.
Dirty Bubble: No! No! You Guys don't understand! It's not what you think!
Mermaid Man: You really thought you were going to get away from it, did you? First up, villains, what’s the BGATFBC?
Man Ray: It stands for the Bad Guys All Together For Book Club!
Mermaid Man: Book Club? You mean you weren't going to destroy a library or something?
Man Ray: Why would we do that? We're almost to the new chapter!
Atomic Flounder: What are you going to do, lock us up for reading?
Jumbo Shrimp: Yeah! You can't prison us for reading!
Mermaid Man: That's right. Remember, kids, no one can imprison you for reading!
Patrick: Hey, what happened? Why are those squiggles on the screen?
SpongeBob: Those are called "End Credits", Patrick.
Patrick: End credits? But I don't want it to end!
SpongeBob: That's why Neptune gave us the rewind button!
Patrick: Thank you, Neptune!
