Love That Squid
Frankie Billy: Excuse me, a patty for the lady please.
Squidward: Try reading the sign, Casanova.
Evelyn: You never learned to read, did you?
Frankie Billy: No.
Evelyn: That's all right, neither did I!
Frankie Billy: We were meant for each other!
Squidward: Even the illiterate are finding love.  Oh, Squidward, why are you torturing yourself with tales of romance?
SpongeBob: Squidward!  You dropped your ook!
Squidward: That's no "ook". That's just a cruel reminder that I'm single, and likely to remain that way forever.
SpongeBob: Don't be sad, buddy. Turn that frown upside down!
Squidward: I prefer my frowns in their traditional orientation.
SpongeBob: Just remember, Squidward. You have never experienced true love. BUT that doesn't mean you will never find it! You know the saying: There's a squid for every pot!
Squidward: Great, let the tired cliches cascade forward.  That'll make me feel better.
Squidward: Who-who is that? She's got da-da-da-da-da...  She's, wow!
Squilvia: I absolutely adore the decor! Exquisitely minimalist!
Squidward: She speaks art jargon!
Squilvia: What culinary delights doth this menu hold?
Squidward: SpongeBob, she's got it all! Class, style, grace,  ..and looks only matched by yours truly!
SpongeBob: Well, why don't you ask her out on one of those dates you keep talking about?
Squidward: My next move exactly! Observe the old Tentacles charm in all its glory!
Squilvia: Is that Salmonese?
SpongeBob: Boy, you are floundering up there!
Squidward: I don't know what I'm doing! I've never felt like this before.
SpongeBob: Squiddy, you've been bitten by the love bug!
Squilvia: Hello! Hello? I'd like to order.
Squidward: She's talking to me. What do I do?
SpongeBob: Squidward, I can help you attract your true love!
Squidward: You!? You don't know the first thing about the fine art of romance!
Squilvia: Well, since no one wants to take my order, I'll go elsewhere.
Squidward: She's leaving!
SpongeBob: Oh no she's not! Hang on, buddy!
Squilvia: Finally, some service around here.
SpongeBob: Hey, Idward Squay. 'Emeber ray the eat day.  I believe Squidward here is trying to ask you on a romantic date, ma'am. Right, Squidward?
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward. Shake the nice lady's hand and say "Hello."
Squilvia: Hello.  My name is Squilvia. Uh... is he okay?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes. He-he's just tired, you know, from all the hard work he's been doing around here. I so admire his work ethic.  So, what do you think? You want to date him?
Squilvia: Uh... I don't know. I'm not too sure...
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! Before you make any hasty decisions, allow me to tell you a few things about my friend, Squidward. Things I think you should know, like that Squidward is by far the single most intelligent person I know.
Squilvia: Intelligent?
SpongeBob: That's right! We are talking some serious credentials.
Squilvia: L.A.M.E.? What school is that?
SpongeBob: The point is, he thinks you look like a ray of pure sunshine in that dress.
Squilvia: Really? Wow. He really said that?
SpongeBob: You betcha! He's such a charmer.
Squidward: Don't forget artistic and musical.
SpongeBob: Not to mention that he's an incredible painter, a virtuoso musician, loves to cook and clean and also enjoys gardening quite a bit, too.
Squilvia: Oh, he sounds interesting!
SpongeBob: But you know what is the most amazing thing about Squidward?  It's his selflessness, his undying commitment to being a true friend. And I know anyone who is lucky enough to go on a romantical date with this guy would get to experience things on a whole 'nother and very special level. So, how does dinner at 8:00 sound, Squilvia?
Squilvia: I think that sounds perfect. I'll come by your place, okay?
Squidward: Uh-huh.
Squilvia: See you at 8:00, Squidward.
SpongeBob: You okay, buddy. You froze up there, buddy.
Squidward: What do you mean?
SpongeBob: I mean, when was the last time you went out on a date?
Squidward: SpongeBob, you've gotta help me! It's been so long! What do I do?
SpongeBob: You, my friend, are in desperate need of a practice date.
Squidward: That's it! I'll go on...  a practice date? I don't get it.
SpongeBob: Just meet me at my house at 5:00, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Just one minute, Squidward!
Squidward: Sometime today would be nice.
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Squidward: Dear Neptune!
SpongeBob: Oh!  Missed a spot!  Aren't you going to compliment my outfit?
Squidward: Um...You look...stunning?
SpongeBob: Oh, you're so sweet! Where are my flowers?
Squidward: What! Oh! Um. Did you drop your lip balm!
SpongeBob: I don't think I've dropped anything... Ooh! You shouldn't have.
Squidward: Oh, but I wanted to!
SpongeBob: No, you really shouldn't have. It's just that I'm very... I'm very aller...  ...very allergic to tulips. Anyway, are you ready to go?
Squidward: Go where?
SpongeBob: To dinner, silly.
Squidward: Oh, right! I'll get my car.  Hop in!  What?
SpongeBob: A gentlemen always opens a door for a lady.
Squidward: Oh, where are my manners!?  Alrighty, so...  Can I help you with that?
SpongeBob: No, no, I've got it!
Squidward: Would you get- There!
SpongeBob: Ah, snug.
Squidward: Uh-huh. Can we go now?
SpongeBob: Yes.
Squidward: Great.
SpongeBob: Right after I tinkle.  Oh good thing i went, i don’t think i would’ve made it to the restaurant. Is something wrong Squidward?
Squidward: No! Just hungry that’s all.
SpongeBob: Great, well I know a fabulous place! Just head this way.
Squidward: Wonderful.
SpongeBob: Okay now at this stop sign turn right.
Squidward: Okay.
SpongeBob: Now at this light make a right.
Squidward: Gotcha.
SpongeBob: Now at this street here make a right. And at this intersection here make a right, and then park right near the orange building just up ahead. Ooh! We're here!
Squidward: You're a real piece of work, you know that?
SpongeBob: Oh why, thank you, Mr. Squidward!  Way to compliment the date, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Now, it's the chit-chat part of the date. Amuse her with an interesting conversation.
Squidward: Oh... Um... Chit-chat... Can you believe this weather we're having?
SpongeBob: Okay, good effort, but you might want to start with something more personal. A woman may like to talk about her day, for example. She may want to talk about her promotion at work, or the wacky antics of her pet snail, or talk about how I was nearly late for our date because I couldn't decide what to wear, and then I didn't really have enough cash to give the lady at the nail salon.
Squidward: Urrgh!
Patrick: Dinner is served.
SpongeBob: Oh! I'm famished!
Patrick: Don't try to eat it. It's plastic.
SpongeBob: Now this is the perfect opportunity to work on your table etiquette.
SpongeBob: Squidward, could you please pass the roasted kelp?
Patrick: Here you go, ma'am!
SpongeBob: Oh thank you, sir!
Patrick: Hey, Squidward, who's the lovely lady sitting across from you? I think she's giving me the cutesy eye!
Squidward: Oh, no you don't, Patrick! You cannot just barge across like this! SpongeBob and I are in the middle of a practice date!
Patrick: So, do you hang out here often?
SpongeBob: Well, this is my home, silly.
Squidward: Excuse me, but how is this supposed to help me with my real date?  Which, by the way begins in five minutes.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait! We haven't covered...  We haven't covered all the tenants of Dating 101 yet!  As I was saying... I, I would like to go over just a few more crucial aspects of the first date.  Such as...
Squidward: SpongeBob! Would you please just shut it and leave me alone?
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward..
Squidward: Don't "um, Squidward" me, you, you annoying, insignificant, waste of my time!
SpongeBob: Um, Squidward.
Squidward: Don't interrupt me! And don't call me, look at me, write me, or even think of me! ‘Cause you and I, we are not friends! And never will be.
SpongeBob: Does this mean there won't be a second date?
Squidward: Um, you saw that, didn't you?
Squilvia: Oh, only all of it.
Squidward: And you probably think I'm a mean-spirited brute, which, ironically, is the exact opposite of what you were expecting, right?
Squilvia: Not exactly.
Squidward: Huh?
Squilvia: I think a guy who doesn't suffer fools lightly is totally dreamy. Let's go eat!
Squidward: SpongeBob, I'm dreamy!
SpongeBob: Have fun, you two! SquarePants, your work here is done.
Patrick: Not quite! I was promised a movie, and some plastic popcorn.
