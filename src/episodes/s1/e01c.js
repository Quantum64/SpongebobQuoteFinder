Sandy: Why, that's my air helmet.
SpongeBob: May I try it on?
Sandy: Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air.
SpongeBob: Me too. I love air. Air is good.
Sandy: No kidding?
SpongeBob: Why, "air" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air.

SpongeBob: Okay, see you tomorrow.  Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air.
Patrick: Do you mean she puts on "airs"?
SpongeBob: I guess so.
Patrick: That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are.
SpongeBob: How's that?
Patrick: Higher.
SpongeBob: Like that?
Patrick: Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants.
