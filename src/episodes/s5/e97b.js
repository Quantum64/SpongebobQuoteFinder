The Battle of Bikini Bottom
Patrick: Where's your best friend now, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Well, according to this T shirt, it says my best friend is right here.
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Right by my side.  Wow, clothing that announces our feelings for each other.  Let's get them, Patrick.
Shubie: Can I help you boys?
SpongeBob: I believe you can. My best friend and I would like to purchase...  Patrick, why are you crying?
Patrick: You...found a new best friend.
SpongeBob: Oh, what are you...  Wait, no, this isn't what it looks like!
SpongeBob: Patrick, look out, behind you!!
Nazz: Excuse me, but does this come in...
Patrick: Noooo! You're not my best friend!
SpongeBob: Weâ€™ve gotta ditch these outfits! They're sending out the wrong signals!
SpongeBob: We need new outfits to show our best friendiness, Pat.
Patrick: You mean like those guys?
SpongeBob: Yeah, just like those guys.   Best friend outfits like these really make a statement.
Patrick: Look at these guys!
SpongeBob: Wow! I like that one. Hey, mister, where did you and your friends get your matching outfits?
Bill: Oh, no, these aren't my friends. In fact, I hate just about everyone here, but my love for historical battles is so great, I join these losers every year to re-enact the battle of Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: There was a battle of Bikini Bottom?
Patrick: Well, duh, SpongeBob. It's only the most significant event in Bikini Bottom history! A long time ago, the town was divided into 2 groups  Those who spent all their time washing their hands like softies
Nathiel Waters: Clean as a whistle!
Patrick: And those who had more important things to do with their time.
Colonial Patrick: That looks good to me.
Nathiel: That is truly disgusting!
Colonial Patrick: Oh, yeah?
Nathiel: You can't go around our town touching things with those filthy mitts!
Colonial Patrick: Oh, yeah?!
Nathiel: Yes!
Red Group: Wash your hands!
Blue Group: Never!
Patrick: And that's how we won our right to wash as we please.
Bill: Oh, that's not what happened.
SpongeBob: You don't wash your hands, Patrick?!
Patrick: Never have, never will.
SpongeBob: Echhh!
Patrick: Does that bother you, huh, SpongeBob?  They only had one ice cream cone.
SpongeBob: That's ok. Thank you, friend.  So, anyway, I said...
Patrick: Oh, wait. You've got something on your tongue.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: Here, I'll get it.
SpongeBob: Thank you.  Frankly, yes, Patrick, that does bother me.
Patrick: Well, then I guess we can't be friends.
SpongeBob: What are you saying?
Patrick: Ugh, do I have to spell it out for you?  U... R... huh... How do you spell "not my friend"?
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, we can work this out. We'll start a new life, just you, me, and this can of disinfectant spray.  Come on in, Patrick. Here, let me take your coat for you.
Patrick: No, thank you.  I happen to like my various smells and germs.
SpongeBob: But being clean is so much better.
Patrick: Well, says you. I like dirty.
SpongeBob: Clean!
Patrick: Dirty!
SpongeBob: Clean!
Harold: Excuse us, but we have a battle to re-enact.
SpongeBob: Fine, if that's how it is, then  I am joining the other side!
Patrick: Fine, me too!
Harold: Ah, come on! Let's go play somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Ha! Got your nose!
Patrick: Hey, give it back!
SpongeBob: Not until you wash your hands!
Patrick: Oh, yeah? Well  I got your eyeballs!
SpongeBob: Eww, brain juice!
Patrick: Do you give up yet?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick , but a filthy slob like you is no match for a clean-cut fellow like me.
Patrick: Your pants are falling down.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: I'll fix it.
SpongeBob: Satisfied?
Patrick: There, you look good now.
SpongeBob: You could use a makeover, though. Ugh, look at those feet.
Patrick: Why, what's wrong with them?
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Patrick: No! Not a pedicure!  No, no, not that, anything but tha-- Nail polish?!  You sick little monster, face my morning breath!
SpongeBob: You, sir, could use some dental hygiene!
Patrick: Who, me? My teeth are fine, see?
SpongeBob: A little toothpaste, and you'll have teeth like mine.  You gotta brush in little circles!
Patrick: Minty fresh! Taste pit, evildoer!!
SpongeBob: You're a stinky, stinky sea star. I think you could use a shot of...this!
Patrick: No! No, not...not deodorant!
Patrick: My beautiful pit stink, it's gone! The gloves are off now.  It's booger time!
SpongeBob: Oh, booger, schmooger, you don't even have a nose.
Patrick: Oh, yeah?
SpongeBob: Booger!  Run, Mr. Krabs! Patrick is digging for gold!
Mr. Krabs: Gold? Heehee!
Squidward: Did you get any of Patrick's "gold"?
Mr. Krabs: He's not digging for any gold I'm looking for.
Patrick: Ha! I got you now!
SpongeBob: Careful, Patrick, I got a weapon!
Patrick: Raw onions?!  That does it!  See this?
SpongeBob: A Krabby Patty? What are you gonna do, eat it?
Patrick: Oh, I'm not going to eat it.
SpongeBob: No, not patty socks!
Patrick: That's right, your precious patties on my stinky feet!
SpongeBob: You better stop that!
Patrick: Stinky, little feet!
SpongeBob: You stop that right now!
Patrick: Hopping...  ...Clams!  Hey, I got my filth back!
SpongeBob: Not for long, Mr. Sticky-Shorts! You won't have your filth once I use this on you!
Patrick: No, not soap! You wouldn't dare!
SpongeBob: Try me!
Patrick: Stay back, I'll do it!
SpongeBob: It's too late for that!
Patrick: My beautiful filth! It's gone! I'm squeaky clean!
SpongeBob: I'm covered in muck and scum!
Patrick: Man, to get my filth back, I'll have to wallow in mud forever!
SpongeBob: It'll take weeks for me to get clean. I'll need twenty baths a day!
Patrick: Slather toe jam on my armpits?
SpongeBob: I'll have to disinfect my eyeballs!
Patrick: Smear slime on my teeth?
SpongeBob: And dry-clean my uvula!
Both: All right!
SpongeBob: Now that I'm filthy, I can spend all day getting clean.
Patrick: And since I'm clean, I can get even filthier! Thanks, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, thank you.
Both: You're my best friend ever!
Bill: Hey, what's going on here? This battle isn't over until we have a winner.
SpongeBob: Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness? We must not re-enact the history that divides us, rather we must embrace that which draws us together. All must be free to choose their own path. Right, friend Patrick?
Patrick: Squeaky clean, squeaky, it's squeaky.
SpongeBob: Mm-hmm, he has embraced the truth.
Bill: Wow! I think the little yellow guy has taught us a valuable lesson.
SpongeBob: And what is that, my son?
Bill: That re-enacting battles is really lame!  C'mon, guys, let's play something more manly, like football!
Harold: Or hockey!
Thaddeus: Or knitting fluffy sweaters!
SpongeBob: Come, Patrick, my work here is done.
