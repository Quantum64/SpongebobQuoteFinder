Nat: Neptune's turned up quite a gale tonight. He must be mad about something.
Shubie: Ha! Hahaha! That's silly. Everyone knows Poseidon is the ruler of the undersea.  Oh. My leftovers.
Nat: Nooo!  Why, dear Neptune?
SpongeBob: Mmmm-mmmm. Goulash.  Hey, anyone out there! You dropped your goulash! Hello?  My pores are whistling in the wind.  Hahahahaha! That tickles!  Aww. The little critter likes my whistling pores.  That tickles!
Moon: My shift's over.
Sun: Time for work, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: All right, Jelly, out you go. It's been a lot of fun, but I gotta get to work.  Quite a wind this morning, eh, Jelly?  Whoa!  Hey, Sparky, can you tell your friends I can't play right now?  Stop it!  Whoa!  Oh! I'm going to be late!  I told you guys, I don't have time to play right now!  I have not been tardy one time in my career as a fry cook and I'm not going to start today!
Jellyfish: Hahaha!
SpongeBob: I gotta call for some help.  My fingers are too big for the buttons.
Mr. Krabs: Hello, this be the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! I need you!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! Where you been, customers are blowin' in here like nobody's business!  and lands on his face, then gets in line
SpongeBob: I am sorry, Mr. Krabs, but these jellyfish don't want me to go to work!
Mr. Krabs: Jellyfish?
SpongeBob: They're attracted to my whistley holes.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, I'll never understand what you just said, but if it's transportation you need, I know just the thing.  Ooh, this one's puttin' up a fight.  Fightin' too hard!  Gotta reel him in, Krabs. Cut a little slack,  then yank!  Cut some slack, then yank!  There he is. Ready for work. Quit whining, boy, and start pushing out them patties.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, sir.  Let's get these patties started right!  That gives me an idea.  Oh, no. They found me. No! No, no, guys, please! Would you mind coming back after business hours? I'm trying to work here.  Whoa!
Weatherman: The weather situation is much worse across the country.
Bob: And it looks like these winds aren't going to stop any time soon.
Patrick: Ha ha ha ha. Fishy go bye-bye.
Barbara: And that's the way it is in your world today.
Patrick: Boring! I don't want to watch any of this boring stuff. I wanna watch something decent like--
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't have any time. I gotta hide from these jellyfish.
Patrick: What jellyfish?
SpongeBob: Ever since the wind started, a sound blows through my holes that jellyfish seem to love.
Patrick: Hey, fella.  Owww!  SpongeBob, get out of here!  I'm sorry, SpongeBob, but you have become a negative influence!
SpongeBob: Hahahaha! At least the wind stopped.  I think I lost them. Well, I guess I'll just stay here where it's safe... and quiet... and dark. Don't worry, I'll just stay here for a second. Behind these rocks. These sanitary, lifeless rocks.
Narrator: Later...
SpongeBob: Hey, buddy. Just thought I'd spruce you up a bit. Wuzzat? Oh, you don't say, well guess what? You're my best friend too. Mmm-hmmm. Come on, let's have some fun. Look buddy, mmmmmmmmm. Dinner's ready. Let's have some tea. Do you want some sugar, buddy? One lump or two? Oh, you can have it all.  I feel comfortable around you.  Can I confess something? Cause I know you'll understand. I have this... problem. I seem to attract jellyfish! Hahahaha! How do you work that out? Hmmmmm.  Yeah, yeah. I'm in a loss, too. Oh, barnacles. I'm gonna be stuck in this cave forever!  Of course, buddy. Brilliant idea!  Let's see what happens this time.  Whoooaaa, here they come! Go get 'em, buddy!  Hey, guys. What do you think about my little friend's song?  Is there something wrong?  Hmm, I crafted one stone SpongeBob that uttered a note in a foul key. But if I were to craft another in a different size,  the dimension of the hollow center multiplied by the number of holes may offer another tune, one that could soothe those jellyfish. But which one is the right size?! Eh, I guess I'll just have to make a bunch of them.  All right. That oughta do her.  WOW. It actually worked... Ah. They're finally leaving me alone. I can go back to work now!  Krusty Krab, here I come!  How long was I gone?!  No! No! No!
Narrator: 3,000 years later...
Alien: To this day, no one knows why these mysterious statues were created or by whom.  All we know is that the genius of their design has caused the annual migration of jellyfish to their wondrous tune.
